ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General Overview
 
Tauriga Sciences, Inc. (the “Company”) is a Florida corporation, with its principal place of business being located at 4 Nancy Court Suite#4, Wappingers Falls, NY 12590. The Company has, over time, moved into that of a diversified life sciences technology company, with its mission to operate a revenue generating business, while continuing to evaluate potential acquisition candidates operating in the life sciences technology space.
Tauriga Pharma Corp.
 
On January 4, 2018, the Company announced the formation of a wholly owned subsidiary in Delaware initially named Tauriga IP Acquisition Corp., which changed its name to Tauriga Biz Dev Corp. on March 25, 2018.
 
Effective January 2020, the Company amended the certificate of incorporation of Tauriga Business Development Corp. in relevant part to effectuate a name change of this subsidiary to Tauriga Pharma Corp. The principal reason for the name change is to concentrate this subsidiary’s focus on the development of a pharmaceutical product line that is synergistic with the Company’s primary CBD product line. Currently, the plan is to initially create a pharmaceutical line of products to address nausea symptoms related to chemotherapy treatment in patients, which we will submit for clinical trials and to regulatory agencies for approval.
 
On March 18, 2020, the Company filed a Provisional U.S. Patent Application covering its Pharmaceutical grade version of Tauri-Gum™. This patent application, filed with the United States Patent & Trademark Office (“U.S.P.T.O.”), is titled: “MEDICATED CBD COMPOSITIONS, METHODS OF MANUFACTURING, AND METHODS OF TREATMENT.” The Company’s proposed pharmaceutical grade version of Tauri-Gum™ is being developed for nausea regulation, intended specifically to target patients subjected to ongoing chemotherapy treatment(s) (the “Indication”). The delivery system for this pharmaceutical product is an improved version of the existing “Tauri-Gum™” chewing gum formulation based on continued research and development.
 
Currently the pharmaceutical grade version of Tauri-Gum is in the pre-IND stage of development. The development team is working on several parallel workstreams, including:
 

● | formulation development; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | non-clinical in vivo and in vitro studies to inform the effective clinical dose and safety margin; 
● | regulatory strategy and regulatory documentation preparation; 
● | confirmation of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API); and 
● | Identifying pharma-grade API suppliers. 

Tauriga Sciences Limited
 
On June 10, 2019, the Company formed a wholly owned subsidiary, Tauriga Sciences Limited, with the Registrar of Companies for Northern Ireland. Tauriga Sciences Limited is a private limited Company. The entity was established in conjunction with e-commerce merchant services. In conjunction to this new entity, the Company entered into a two-year lease commencing on June 11, 2019. The office is located at Regus World Trade Centre Muelle de Barcelona, edif. Sur, 2a Planta Barcelona Cataluña 08039 Spain. The Company terminated this lease during October 2020. The Company no longer maintains an office in this region.
Collaboration Agreement with Aegea Biotechnologies Inc.
 
On April 3, 2020, Tauriga Sciences, Inc. entered into a collaboration agreement (“Collaboration Agreement”) with Aegea Biotechnologies Inc. (“Aegea”), for the purpose of developing a Rapid, Multiplexed Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Point of Care Test with Superior Sensitivity and Selectivity (the “SARS-Col 2 Test”). The parties believed that the benefits of the SARS-CoV-2 Test were the following: a Rapid SARS-CoV-2 test with the sensitivity and specificity to eliminate false negatives and false positives, and with the ability to detect and measure viral shed, even in patients who are asymptomatic. This SARS-CoV-2 test would use Aegea’s patented technologies, to take coronavirus testing to the next level by differentiating different strains of SARS-CoV-2. The test, if successful, would be adaptable to additional SARS-CoV-2 strain types as necessary and as the virus mutates. It also has the possibility to be rapidly customized to provide similarly sensitive and specific assays for other viruses. The Company committed to raise funding for the purposes set forth in under the Collaboration Agreement from its $5,000,000 Equity Line of Credit (“ELOC”) with Tangiers Global, LLC, which became effective on March 16, 2020. Seventy percent (70%) of the net proceeds from the sale of the initial 10,000,000 shares of stock of Tauriga under the ELOC were invested in Aegea for the development of the Covid Test and used to purchase shares of common stock of Aegea, at a purchase price of $4.00 per share. The $4.00 stock price corresponds to a current pre-money valuation of Aegea of $25,000,000 for each tranche of cash, up to the first $2,000,000 of our investment in Aegea. Additionally, as part of our agreement with Aegea, on May 26, 2020, Tauriga issued to Aegea 5,000,000 unregistered common shares of Tauriga common stock. On August 10, 2020, the Company and Aegea amended their Collaboration Agreement. Under the terms of the amendment, having invested 70% of the proceeds from the sale of the initial 10,000,000 shares of Tauriga stock under the ELOC with Tangiers, the Company increased the percentage of proceeds it invested in Aegea on the sale of the remaining shares available under the ELOC agreement from 20% to 40%.

On January 6, 2021, however, the Company determined to terminate its ELOC by terminating each of the Investment Agreement and Registration Rights Agreement, and on January 8, 2021 filed a Post-Effective Amendment to its Form S-1 Registration Statement (333-236923) which removed from registration all shares not previously sold thereunder. This effectively also eliminates our obligation to any additional funding to Aegea under the Collaboration Agreement. As of March 31, 2021, the Company had invested $278,212 in Aegea for 69,553 shares, representing an ownership percentage of 1.03%. As of March 31, 2021, resultant delays of project milestones have led the Company to determined that full recovery of its investment in Aegea is in doubt and has recorded a 50% impairment loss on its consolidated Statement of Operations in the amount of $139,106. Aegea is still moving forward on this project and the Company will continue to monitor the progress.
 
On February 26, 2021, as part of a settlement agreement concluding the Collaboration Agreement, the Company acquired an additional 69,552 common shares of Aegea, increasing the Company’s total holdings to 139,104 Aegea shares (representing a 2.04% stake in Aegea as of March 31, 2021).
 
Chief Medical Officer
 
On July 15, 2020, the Company appointed Dr. Keith Aqua (“Dr. Aqua”) as an independent contractor to the position of Chief Medical Officer (“CMO”) and entered into a consulting agreement with Dr. Aqua which carries a term of 12 months from inception, expiring on July 15, 2021. In his CMO capacity, Dr. Aqua will help the Company progress in the development of the Company’s proposed pharmaceutical grade version of Tauri-Gum™. In addition, Dr. Aqua will help establish a distribution network for the Company to market its Tauri-Gum™ brand to a variety of physicians and medical practices in southern Florida. In consideration of the services being provided by Dr. Aqua, and pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, the Company has agreed to issue Dr. Aqua (i) upon entry into the Agreement 750,000 shares of restricted common stock, (ii) agreed to 750,000 shares of restricted common stock which will be issued in equal monthly instalments of 62,500 shares beginning August 15, 2020 and (iii) agreed to $4,000 cash per quarter during the term of the Agreement, payable following the completion of each such quarter. As of March 31, 2021, the Company issued 1,187,500 restricted shares of its common stock to Dr. Aqua valued at $46,906 ($0.0395 per share). Subsequent to March 31, 2021, Dr. Aqua was issued 187,500 restricted shares of its common stock valued at $7,406 ($0.0395 per share).
Master Services Agreement
 
On December 16, 2020, we entered into a Master Services Agreement with North Carolina based Clinical Strategies & Tactics, Inc. (“CSTI”) to resume the clinical development of its proposed anti-nausea pharmaceutical grade version of Tauri-Gum™. CSTI will primarily focus its efforts on (i) Pharmaceutical Development Strategy, (ii) Commercialization Strategy, and (iii) Funding Strategy. The Company will with work with CSTI’s founder and chief executive officer, JoAnn C. Giannone, who has over 25 years’ experience effectively leading companies through the drug and medical device development process. On December 23, 2020, the Company funded the costs associated with this Agreement, which total consulting fees were $67,500, exclusive of out-of-pocket reimbursable expenses. The Company has paid additional fees, effected through change orders to the original contract, in the amount of $85,000. These additional fees were for pharmaceutical testing and market research. Under the terms of the Agreement and related statement of work, CTSI will provide a high-level assessment and documentation of the development efforts required to commercialize the proposed pharmaceutical product globally, a commercial assessment, and a review of potential funding strategies and funding sources and potential business partners. The delivery system for this proposed pharmaceutical version is a modified version (with higher concentration of CBD) of the existing Tauri-Gum™” chewing gum formulation based on continued research and development.

REGULATORY MATTERS
 
Food and Drug Administration
 
On May 31, 2019, the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) held public hearings to obtain scientific data and information about the safety, manufacturing, product quality, marketing, labeling, and sale of products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds, including CBD. The hearing came approximately five months after the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018 (more commonly known as the Farm Bill), went into effect and removed industrial hemp from the Schedule I prohibition under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) (industrial hemp means cannabis plants and derivatives that contain no more than 0.3 percent tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, on a dry weight basis).
 
Though the Farm Bill removed industrial hemp from the Schedule I list, the Farm Bill preserved the regulatory authority of the FDA over cannabis and cannabis-derived compounds used in food and pharmaceutical products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and section 351 of the Public Health Service Act. The FDA has been clear that it intends to use this authority to regulate cannabis and cannabis-derived products, including CBD, in the same manner as any other food or drug ingredient. In addition to holding the hearing, the agency had requested comments by July 2, 2019 regarding any health and safety risks of CBD use, and how products containing CBD are currently produced and marketed, which comment period was concluded on July 16, 2019. As of the date hereof, the FDA has taken the position that it is unlawful to put into interstate commerce food products containing hemp derived CBD, or to market CBD as, or in, a dietary supplement. Furthermore, since the closure of the FDA hearings on this issue, some state and local agencies have issued a ban on the sale of any food or beverages containing CBD. There have been legislative efforts at the federal level, which seek to provide clear guidance to industry stakeholders regarding how to comply with applicable FDA law with respect to CBD and other hemp derived cannabinoids. However, such legislative efforts have been limited and as of this date, these legislative efforts require extensive further approvals, including approval from both houses of Congress and the President of the United States, before being enacted into law, if at all.
 
Furthermore, with respect to Company’s developing CBG and additional cannabinoid product lines, the FDA has provided no guidance as to how cannabinoids other than CBD (such as CBG) shall be regulated under the FD&C Act, and it is unclear at this time how such potential regulation could affect the results of the operations or prospects of the Company or this product line.
 
FDA Clinical Trial Process – United States Drug Development
 
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs, medical devices and combinations of drugs and devices, or combination products, under the FDCA and its implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, requests for voluntary product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
 
The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 

● | completion of extensive pre-clinical in vitro and animal studies to evaluate safety and pharmacodynamic effects , formulation development, analytical method development, and manufacturing of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and drug product for clinical trials in accordance with applicable regulations, including the FDA’s Current Good Laboratory Practice (cGLP) regulations and Current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulations; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 
● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with an applicable IND and other clinical study related regulations, sometimes referred to as Current Good Clinical Practice (cGCPs), to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its proposed indication, and API and drug product scale-up for registration batch production and stability; 
● | submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application (NDA); 
● | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with the FDA’s cGMP requirements; 
● | potential FDA audit of the clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and 
● | FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale. 

 
Once a pharmaceutical product candidate is identified for development, it enters the pre-clinical testing stage. Pre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product characterization, drug product formulation development and stability, as well as pharmacology and toxicology animal studies. An IND Sponsor must submit the results of the pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, to the FDA as part of the IND. The sponsor must also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the initial clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the initial clinical trial lends itself to an efficacy evaluation. Some pre-clinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions related to a proposed clinical trial and places the trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance, and may be imposed on all drug products within a certain class of drugs. The FDA also can impose partial clinical holds, for example, prohibiting the initiation of clinical trials of a certain duration or for a certain dose.

All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with GCP regulations. These regulations include the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Further, an IRB must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at any institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trial are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the information regarding the clinical trial and the consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal Representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed.
 
Each new clinical protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted for FDA review, and to the IRBs for approval. Protocols detail, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety.
 
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined. The phases are described below. For the TAUG Pharma product, however, the safety profile of the API is known, and a Phase 1 program is not expected. Therefore, it is anticipated that that the first-time-in-human (FTIH) study will be a Phase 2 study.
 

● | Phase 1. The product is initially introduced into a small number of healthy human subjects or patients and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product is suspected or known to be unavoidably toxic, the initial human testing may be conducted in patients. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Phase 2. Involves clinical trials in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and schedule. 
● | Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. 

 
Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 trials. Companies that conduct certain clinical trials also are required to register them and post the results of completed clinical trials on a government-sponsored database, such as ClinicalTrials.gov in the United States, within certain timeframes. Failure to do so can result in fines, adverse publicity and civil and criminal sanctions.
 
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, findings from other studies that suggest a significant risk to humans exposed to the product, findings from animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk to human subjects, and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or Investigator Brochure. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the clinical trial Sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study. The clinical trial Sponsor may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives and/or competitive climate.
 
The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 
NDA and FDA Review Process
 
The results of product development, pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA for a new drug, requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of a substantial user fee, and the sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to an annual program user fee; although a waiver of such fee may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. For example, the agency will waive the application fee for the first human drug application that a small business or its affiliate submits for review.
 
The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting an NDA for filing. The FDA typically makes a decision on accepting an NDA for filing within 60 days of receipt. The decision to accept the NDA for filing means that the FDA has made a threshold determination that the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”), the FDA’s goal to complete its substantive review of a standard NDA and respond to the applicant is ten months from the receipt of the NDA. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates, and the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification and may go through multiple review cycles.
 
After the NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMPs to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. The FDA will likely re-analyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and us during the review process. The review and evaluation of an NDA by the FDA is extensive and time consuming and may take longer than originally planned to complete, and we may not receive a timely approval, if at all.
 
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMPs. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. In addition, before approving an NDA, the FDA may also audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. After the FDA evaluates the application, manufacturing process and manufacturing facilities, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s), and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive, and the FDA may interpret data differently than the Sponsor interprets the same data.
 
New York State Department of Health 
 
The New York State Department of Health (NYDPH) has begun implementing regulations concerning the processing and retail sale of hemp derived cannabinoids. Under the regulations, “cannabinoid” is broadly defined as “any phytocannabinoid found in hemp, including but not limited to, Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA), cannabidiol (CBD), cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), cannabinol (CBN), cannabigerol (CBG), cannabichromene (CBC), cannabicyclol (CBL), cannabivarin (CBV), tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV), cannabidivarin (CBDV), cannabichromevarin (CBCV), cannabigerovarin (CBGV), cannabigerol monomethyl ether (CBGM), cannabielsoin (CBE), cannabicitran (CBT). Cannabinoids do not include synthetic cannabinoids as that term is defined [under New York law].”

--


These regulations came into effect on January 1, 2021, and all “cannabinoid hemp processors” and “cannabinoid hemp retailers” operating within the state of New York must be licensed by the NYDPH. The regulations expressly allow for food and beverages to contain “cannabinoids”, so long as such products meet certain requirements. To this end, the Company has submitted its license application with the NYDPH in compliance with this legislation. These regulations are evolving and the NYDPH recently issued a set of proposed regulations to address the use of industrial hemp derived Δ8- Tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ8 THC) and Δ10- Tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ10 THC) in cannabinoid hemp products manufactured and sold in New York. These proposed regulations are currently in a public comment period, and it is unclear at this time as to what the final regulations to be implemented will include.
 
The product requirements under the current regulations, include but are not limited to: the product must not contain more than 0.3% total Δ9- Tetrahydrocannabinol concentration; the product must not contain tobacco or alcohol; the product must not be in the form of an injectable, transdermal patch, inhaler, suppository, flower product including cigarette, cigar or pre-roll, or any other disallowed form as determined by the NYDPH; if the product is sold as a food or beverage product, it must not have more than 25mg of cannabinoids per product; and, if sold as an inhalable cannabinoid hemp product, the product will be subject to a number of additional safety measures.
 
Furthermore, all cannabinoid products sold at retail are subject to a series of labeling requirements. All such products must be labeled with the amount of cannabinoids in the product and the amount of milligrams per serving. If the product contains THC, the amount of THC in the product needs to be stated on the label in milligrams on a per serving and per package basis. In addition, all products are required to have a scannable bar code or QR code which links to a certificate of analysis and the packaging is prohibited from being attractive to consumers under 18 years of age. Products are also required to list appropriate warnings for consumer awareness. The Company’s entire product line will comply with the above standards.
 
See our Risk Factors for more information about these items, as well as certain related disclosures included our Results of Operations under the heading “Going Concern”.
 
The Company’s activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including failing to secure additional funding, success in developing and marketing its products and the level of competition and potential regulatory enforcement actions. These risks and others are described in greater detail in the Risk Factors set forth in this prospectus.

(“Aegea”), for the purpose of developing a Rapid, Multiplexed Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Point of Care Test with Superior Sensitivity and Selectivity (the “SARS-Col 2 Test”). The parties believed that the benefits of the SARS-CoV-2 Test were the following: a Rapid SARS-CoV-2 test with the sensitivity and specificity to eliminate false negatives and false positives, and with the ability to detect and measure viral shed, even in patients who are asymptomatic. This SARS-CoV-2 test would use Aegea’s patented technologies, to take coronavirus testing to the next level by differentiating different strains of SARS-CoV-2. The test, if successful, would be adaptable to additional SARS-CoV-2 strain types as necessary and as the virus mutates. It also has the possibility to rapidly be customized to provide similarly sensitive and specific assays for other viruses. The Company committed to raise funding for the purposes set forth in under the Collaboration Agreement from its $5,000,000 Equity Line of Credit (“ELOC”) with Tangiers Global, LLC, which became effective on March 16, 2020. Seventy percent (70%) of the net proceeds from the sale of the initial 10,000,000 shares of stock of Tauriga under the ELOC were invested in Aegea for the development of the Covid Test and used to purchase shares of common stock of Aegea, at a purchase price of $4.00 per share. The $4.00 stock price corresponds to a current pre-money valuation of Aegea of $25,000,000 for each tranche of cash, up to the first $2,000,000 of our investment in Aegea. Additionally, as part of our agreement with Aegea, on May 26, 2020, Tauriga issued to Aegea 5,000,000 unregistered common shares of Tauriga common stock. On August 10, 2020, the Company and Aegea amended their Collaboration Agreement. Under the terms of the amendment, having invested 70% of the proceeds from the sale of the initial 10,000,000 shares of Tauriga stock under the ELOC with Tangiers, the Company increased the percentage of proceeds it invested in Aegea on the sale of the remaining shares available under the ELOC agreement from 20% to 40%.
 
On January 6, 2021, however, the Company determined to terminate its ELOC by terminating each of the Investment Agreement and Registration Rights Agreement, and on January 8, 2021 filed a Post-Effective Amendment to its Form S-1 Registration Statement (333-236923) which removed from registration all shares not previously sold thereunder. This effectively also eliminates our obligation to any additional funding to Aegea under the Collaboration Agreement. As of March 31, 2021, the Company had invested $278,212 in Aegea for 69,553 shares, representing an ownership percentage of 1.03%. As of March 31, 2021, resultant delays of project milestones have led the Company to determined that full recovery of its investment in Aegea is in doubt and has recorded a 50% impairment loss on its consolidated Statement of Operations in the amount of $139,106. Aegea is still moving forward on this project and the Company will continue to monitor the progress.
 
On February 26, 2021, as part of a settlement agreement concluding the Collaboration Agreement, the Company acquired an additional 69,552 common shares of Aegea, increasing the Company’s total holdings to 139,104 Aegea shares (representing a 2.04% stake in Aegea as of March 31, 2021).
