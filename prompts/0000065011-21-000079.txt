ITEM 1. BUSINESS
GENERAL
Meredith Corporation has been committed to service journalism since its inception in 1902 as an agricultural publisher. In 1924, the Company published the first issue of Better Homes & Gardens. The Company entered the television broadcasting business in 1948. Today Meredith uses multiple media platforms—including print, digital, video, audio, and broadcast television—to provide consumers with content and experiences they desire and to deliver the messages of our advertising and marketing partners. Nationally, Meredith serves approximately 190 million unduplicated American consumers, including nearly 95 percent of all United States (U.S.) women. Meredith’s broadcast television stations reach 11 percent of U.S. households.
The Company is incorporated under the laws of the State of Iowa. Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol MDP.
The Company operates two business segments: national media and local media. Our national media segment includes leading national consumer media brands delivered across print magazines, digital media, brand licensing activities, performance marketing, database-related activities, affinity marketing, business-to-business marketing products and services, and other related operations. Our focus is on the entertainment, food, lifestyle, parenting, and home categories, which include brands such as People, Better Homes & Gardens, InStyle, Allrecipes, Real Simple, Shape, Southern Living, and Martha Stewart Living among others. In addition to subscription magazines, in fiscal 2021, we published over 300 special interest publications. Most of our brands are also available as digital editions on one or more of the major digital newsstands and on major tablet devices. The national media segment’s extensive digital presence consists of 39 websites and applications (apps) reaching more than 150 million consumers every month.
Our local media segment consists of 17 television stations located across the U.S. concentrated in fast-growing markets with related digital media assets. The television stations include seven CBS affiliates, five FOX affiliates, two MyNetworkTV affiliates, one NBC affiliate, one ABC affiliate, and two independent stations. Local media’s digital presence includes 12 websites and 12 apps focused on news, sports, and weather-related information. In addition, the local media segment sells geographically and demographically targeted advertising programs to third parties.
Financial information about industry segments can be found in Item 7-Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 8-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, under Note 19.
The Company’s largest revenue source is advertising. National and local economic conditions affect the magnitude of our advertising revenues. Both national media and local media revenues and operating results can be affected by changes in the demand for advertising and consumer demand for our products. Television advertising is seasonal and cyclical to some extent, traditionally generating higher revenues in the second and fourth fiscal quarters and during key political contests and major sporting events. Magazine circulation revenues are generally affected by national and regional economic conditions and competition from other forms of media.
BUSINESS DEVELOPMENTS
Pending Merger Transaction
As of May 3, 2021, and as amended on June 2, 2021, Meredith, Gray Television, Inc. (Gray), and Gray Hawkeye Stations, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gray, entered into a definitive merger agreement pursuant to which Gray will acquire Meredith for $2.825 billion (the Merger) immediately after and subject to the consummation of the Spin-Off (as described below). Immediately prior to the consummation of the merger, Meredith intends to separate its local media group and national media group into two independent companies by distributing (the Distribution) to Meredith’s shareholders, on a pro rata basis, the issued and outstanding capital stock of Meredith Holdings Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Meredith (NMG SpinCo), which will hold the Company’s national media group and corporate segments following the separation (collectively, the Spin-Off). Following the Spin-Off, NMG SpinCo will focus on its national media group portfolio and accelerating the growth of its iconic brands including People, Better Homes & Gardens, and Allrecipes. The transaction is expected to close prior to the end of calendar year 2021.
Other Business Developments
In August 2020, Meredith launched Meredith Data Studio, a suite of advertising solutions leveraging the Company's vast, proprietary, first-party data, and predictive insights capabilities to help inform its partners' marketing, product, and business strategies. The offerings feature full-service data solutions, predictive analytics, consulting, and self-service tools, all powered by Meredith's 360 platform, which provides end-to-end audience insights and predictive capabilities to analyze billions of intent signals and engagements to trends and purchase intent in order to deliver precisely targeted audience and contextual advertising.
In September 2020, the Company debuted People (The TV Show!), which was the top-rated new syndicated show of the Fall 2020 season in the 12 markets where it airs. Meredith is currently selling the show to our markets for an anticipated launch nationally in Fall 2022. The show has been renewed for three additional seasons, through 2024.
Effective October 2020, Meredith named Evolution USA as our North America, Australia, and New Zealand licensing and brand management agency for the LIFE brand and The LIFE Picture Collection. Accelerating the next step in monetizing and managing these iconic assets, Evolution USA actively seeks new licensing and brand expansion opportunities for LIFE and its massive photo archive in a variety of product classifications and consumer experiences. These include apparel, accessories, home furnishings, housewares, gifts and collectibles, food and beverage, stationery and paper goods, brand and artist collaborations, hospitality, location-based entertainment experiences, gaming, and promotions.
As a result of strong consumer demand and success on the newsstand, Meredith re-launched home delivery subscriptions for Traditional Home, Coastal Living, and Cooking Light with their Winter 2020 issues and Rachel Ray in Season with its Winter/Spring 2021 issue. These titles’ subscription models had been discontinued in a previous year and were most recently newsstand only titles.
In January 2021, Meredith sold the Travel + Leisure trademark and other related assets, including the Travel + Leisure travel clubs. Meredith entered into a 30-year royalty-free licensing relationship to license back the Travel + Leisure brand and continues to publish the magazine and operate the Travel + Leisure media platforms.
In April 2021, Meredith announced the premiere of season two of The Southern Living Show, new episodes of Allrecipes Eating In!, and new specials from Better Homes & Gardens. The programming airs on the LMG local broadcast TV stations. The Southern Living Show originally launched in April 2020 celebrates the Southern lifestyle, covering food, home, travel, and style.
In May 2021, Meredith announced the launch of PawPrint, the largest consumer magazine dedicated to pet families, according to MediaRadar. PawPrint is a companion to DailyPaws.com, which launched in 2020 as Meredith's digital brand, publishing high-quality pet care content.
In June 2021, the Company launched People in the '90s, a weekly podcast that takes a nostalgic look at the stars and stories that defined a decade. Each of the 12 episodes focuses on one print issue of People from 1990 through 1999, along with the news and events that occurred during the week the issue hit newsstands. It is the third podcast from the brand, which launched the daily People Every Day podcast in February 2021.
COVID-19 Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our results, positively in some areas and negatively in others. In the face of unprecedented business conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we leveraged our core values, agility, connection to tens of millions of consumers, and relationships with advertisers and marketers to quickly adapt to changing business conditions. We believe our connection to consumers has strengthened, as visits to our websites, response rates to our magazine solicitation offers, sales of our licensed products, and our performance marketing activities all increased. In the first half of fiscal 2021, digital advertising revenues grew strongly, as economic uncertainty caused advertising clients to favor platforms with short lead times and flexibility. Magazine advertising revenues, which have relatively long lead times, were negatively impacted, particularly those focused on categories that have been most impacted by the pandemic, including travel and luxury.
As we have progressed through the pandemic, quantifying the specific impact becomes more challenging. The Company estimates that the COVID-19 impact on total revenues was a net decrease of revenues of approximately $100.0 million to $150.0 million in fiscal 2021.
In response to the pandemic, the Company introduced a number of measures to strengthen its financial position, preserve liquidity, and improve its financial flexibility. These included pausing Meredith Corporation’s dividend, refinancing our preferred equity with less expensive term debt, reducing capital expenditures, improving working capital, and temporarily reducing pay for Meredith Corporation’s Board of Directors, executives, and approximately 60 percent of its employees. Full pay was reinstated for all parties in early September 2020.
At this time, we have not experienced a negative impact on our liquidity due to COVID-19, and we believe we have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our cash needs for the foreseeable future.
We continue to monitor the ongoing and evolving situation. There may be developments outside our control requiring us to adjust our operating plan. There remains the risk that COVID-19 could have material adverse impacts on our future revenue growth as well as our overall profitability.
For additional details regarding the impacts and risks to our business from the COVID-19 pandemic, refer to Item 1-Risk Factors and Item 7-Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
National Media
National media contributed 68 percent of Meredith’s consolidated revenues and 53 percent of the combined operating profit from national media and local media operations in fiscal 2021. People and Better Homes & Gardens, our flagship brands, together account for a significant percentage of revenues and operating profit of the national media segment and the Company.

1 | Rate base is the circulation guaranteed to advertisers. Actual circulation generally exceeds rate base and, for most of the Company’s titles, is tracked by the Alliance for Audited Media, which issues periodic statements for audited magazines.

In addition to these major magazine titles, we published 300 special interest publications under a variety of brands in fiscal 2021. The titles are issued from one to six times annually and sold primarily on newsstands. A limited number of special interest publication subscriptions are also sold.
Magazine Advertising—Advertising revenues are generated primarily from sales to clients engaged in consumer marketing. Many of Meredith’s larger magazines offer regional and demographic editions that contain similar editorial content but allow advertisers to customize messages to specific markets or audiences. The Company sells two primary types of magazine advertising: display and direct response. Advertisements are either run-of-press (printed along with the editorial portions of the magazine) or inserts (preprinted pages). Most of the national media segment’s advertising revenues are derived from run-of-press display advertising. Meredith also possesses strategic marketing capabilities, which provide clients and their agencies with access to all of Meredith’s media platforms and capabilities, including print, television, digital, video, consumer events, and custom marketing. Our team of creative and marketing experts deliver innovative solutions across multiple media channels that meet each client’s unique advertising and promotional requirements.
The rates at which we sell print advertising depend on each magazine’s rate base, which is the circulation of the magazine that we guarantee to our advertisers, as well as our audience size and composition. If we are not able to meet our committed rate base, the price paid by advertisers is generally subject to downward adjustments, including in the form of future credits or discounts. Our published rates for each of our magazines are subject to negotiation with each of our advertisers. We sell digital advertising primarily on a flat rate/sponsorship basis or on a cost per thousand, or CPM, basis. Flat rate/sponsorship deals are sold on an exclusive basis to advertisers giving them access to our major events and/or adjacent to prominent and specific areas of our websites. CPM deals are sold on an impression basis with a guarantee that we will deliver the negotiated volume commitment. If we are not able to meet the impression goal, we will extend the campaign or provide alternative placements.
Magazine Circulation—Most of our magazines are sold primarily by subscription and delivered to subscribers through the mail. Subscriptions obtained through direct-mail solicitation, agencies, insert cards, the internet, and other means are Meredith’s largest source of circulation revenues. Revenue per subscription and related expenses can vary significantly by source. The majority of subscription magazines are also sold by single copy. Single copies sold on newsstands are distributed primarily through magazine wholesalers, who have the right to receive credit from the Company for magazines returned to them by retailers.
Newsstand sales include sales through traditional newsstands as well as supermarkets, convenience stores, pharmacies, and other retail outlets. We also publish branded books, including soft-cover “bookazines.” These are distributed through magazine-style “check-out pockets” at retail outlets and traditional trade book channels. We publish books on a diverse range of topics aligned with our brands, including special commemorative and biographical books. We also publish books under various licensed third-party brands and a number of original titles. Our Oxmoor House imprint publishes a variety of home, cooking, and health books under our lifestyle-oriented brands as well as licensed third-party brands.
Digital Media
National media’s 39 websites and apps provide information, ideas, and inspiration to more than 150 million unique monthly visitors, including approximately three-quarters of all American women. These branded websites focus on the topics that women care about most—celebrity, entertainment, food, home, health, beauty, style, and wellness. Our brands also engage on all major social platforms, through robust newsletter programs, audio products, and connected devices. For example, Allrecipes.com and People.com are No. 1 in their respective categories in terms of monthly visitors and engage consumers across all major social platforms, multiple podcasts, and Amazon Alexa skills. In fiscal 2021, our brands had 5 billion video views and reached approximately 88 million Facebook fans, 48 million Twitter followers, 48 million Instagram followers, over 15 million Pinterest followers, and over 10 million YouTube subscribers. Meredith brands also sent nearly 2 billion emails each month and have 17 podcasts across 11 brands.
Powering our digital business is our proprietary technology platform that houses all of our content, our unique taxonomy, our first-party data and insights, and our user identity graph. This platform allows us to have a unified view of our consumers and how they interact with our content and products, a universal taxonomy for our brands, and first-party data. This combination provides us with deep predictive insights into user behavior that can be used to power our content and product development strategy and it, in turn, drives advertising and performance marketing dollars. Through this platform, Meredith captures billions of rich first-party contextual and intent signals each year, making our capabilities and scale even more valuable as third-party cookies grow obsolete.
Other Sources of Revenues
Other revenues are derived from digital and customer relationship marketing, other custom publishing projects, brand licensing agreements, and ancillary products and services.
Affinity Marketing—Synapse Group, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Meredith, is an affinity marketing company that partners with publishers, brick and mortar retailers, digital partners, airline frequent flier programs, and customer service and direct response call centers. It is a major marketer of magazine subscriptions in the U.S. Building on its continuity marketing expertise, Synapse has diversified its business to also market other products and services. Meredith also owns magazines.com and magazine.store, websites focused on the sales of Meredith and third-party magazine subscriptions. 
Brand Licensing—Meredith Brand Licensing generates revenue through multiple long-term trademark licensing agreements with retailers, manufacturers, publishers, and service providers. Our licensing programs extend the reach of Meredith brands into additional consumer channels in the U.S. and abroad. Currently the world’s second- largest global licensor, Meredith has direct-to-retail partnerships with leading companies, including Better Homes & Gardens at Walmart, Southern Living at Dillard’s, and InStyle-branded hair salons in select JC Penney stores and several manufacturers and service providers who sell licensed product to a variety of retailers.
Our most significant partnership is Better Homes & Gardens-branded products sold at Walmart stores in the U.S. and at Walmart.com. The brand is represented by more than 3,000 products across multiple categories in the home décor, outdoor living, DIY and home improvement, and garden space. Meredith also has a long-term agreement to license the Better Homes & Gardens brand to Realogy Corporation, which is entering its 14th year as a residential real estate franchise system operating as Better Homes and Gardens Real Estate, LLC. The real estate network now includes more than 350 offices and more than 12,500 real estate professionals across the U.S., Canada, Bahamas, Jamaica, Australia, and New Zealand. Also, in the real estate sector, the Southern Living and Coastal Living brands include networks of hotels and inspired residential communities in the southeastern U.S. and Belize.
The Allrecipes licensing program with Lifetime Brands, Inc. offered at Kroger stores and Kroger.com for approximately 85 kitchenware items, plus launched Allrecipes spice sets which are available on amazon.com.
The Company expands its international reach primarily through international licensing agreements. Meredith’s national media brands are currently distributed, including a localized presence, in multiple countries. The Company continues to pursue activities that will serve consumers and advertisers while also extending and strengthening the reach and vitality of our brands.
Meredith has granted distribution rights for backlist titles of our consumer-leading brands, including the powerful Better Homes & Gardens imprint, to a book publisher. Meredith creates book content and retains all approval and content rights while the distributor is responsible for reprinting, sales and marketing, distribution, and inventory management. Meredith receives revenue based on sales less a 20 percent distributor fee.
The Foundry 360—The Foundry 360 is a creative content studio serving clients across a broad range of industries. The services include using our content creation expertise to develop content marketing programs across multiple platforms, including native advertising that enables clients to engage new consumers and build long-term relationships with existing customers.
Production and Delivery
Paper, printing, and postage costs accounted for 21 percent of the national media segment’s fiscal 2021 operating expenses. Coated and supercalendered publication paper is the major raw material essential to the national media segment. We directly purchase all the paper for our magazine production and custom publishing business. The Company has contractual agreements with major paper manufacturers to ensure adequate supplies for planned publishing requirements. The price of paper is driven by overall market conditions and is therefore difficult to predict. In fiscal 2021, average paper prices decreased 15 percent, whereas in fiscal 2020, average paper prices decreased 4 percent. In fiscal 2019, average paper prices increased 10 percent. Management anticipates an increase in paper prices of approximately 11 percent in fiscal 2022.
As a result of significant consolidation in the printing industry, at present there is one printer in the United States with the capability and capacity to handle a substantial portion of Meredith’s magazine print production. We have a long-term contract with that printer through 2030, creating extended price stability for our print manufacturing prices.
Postage is a significant expense of the national media segment. We continually seek the most economical and effective methods for mail delivery, including cost-saving strategies that leverage work-sharing opportunities offered within the postal rate structure. 
In general, postage rate changes are capped by law at the rate of inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), but may be above-CPI price increases on the basis of certain factors. Postage prices have risen in each of the last three years. In January 2021, the United States Postal Service (USPS) increased rates by approximately 1.8 percent for First-Class Mail and 1.5 percent for other categories. The most recent rate change was an increase of approximately 6.9 percent effective August 2021. The USPS has also announced proposed temporary rate adjustments for the 2021 holiday season. Under the revised rate authority methodology, Meredith expects above-CPI price increases for the foreseeable future. Meredith continues to work independently as well as with others to 
encourage and assist the USPS find and implement efficiencies to contain rate increases. We cannot, however, predict future changes in the postal rates or the impact they will have on our national media business.
Subscription fulfillment services for Meredith's national media brands are provided by third parties. National magazine newsstand distribution services are also provided by third parties through multi-year agreements.
Competition
Our business is characterized by continuously evolving technology, frequent product evolution, and changing preferences from consumers, advertisers, and marketers. Media is intensely competitive, particularly for women’s attention and for spending from advertisers and marketers. Our magazines and related publishing products and services compete with other mass media, including the internet and many other leisure-time activities. Our digital businesses compete against diversified multi-platform media companies, ‘pure-play’ digital companies, news aggregators, search engines, social media platforms, and large digital platform operators. Competition for consumer attention is based principally on editorial content, marketing skills, price, and customer service. Competition for advertising dollars is based primarily on advertising rates, circulation levels, reader demographics and engagement, advertiser results, and sales team effectiveness. While competition is strong for established titles, gaining readership for newer magazines and specialty publications is especially competitive. We believe our primary competitive differentiators are our large reach to American consumers, particularly women; our expertise at creating content and experiences that drive meaningful consumer engagement; our trusted and iconic brands; our proprietary technology and analytics platform; and our long-standing relationships with advertisers and marketers.
Local Media
Local media contributed 32 percent of Meredith’s consolidated revenues and 47 percent of the combined operating profit from national media and local media operations in fiscal 2021. Information about the Company’s television stations at June 30, 2021, is as follows:

Designated Market Area (DMA) is a registered trademark of, and is defined by, Nielsen Media Research. The national rank is from the 2020-2021 DMA ranking. 
Average audience share represents the estimated percentage of households using television tuned to the station in the DMA. The percentages shown reflect the average total day shares (6:00 a.m. to 2:00 a.m.) for the November 2020, February 2021, and May 2021 measurement periods. 

Operations
The principal sources of the local media segment’s revenues are 1) retransmission of our television signals by cable, satellite, telecommunications, and over-the-top service providers; 2) local non-political advertising focusing on the immediate geographic area of the stations; 3) national non-political advertising; 4) political advertising which is cyclical with peaks occurring in our odd-numbered fiscal years (e.g., fiscal 2019, fiscal 2021) and particularly in our second fiscal quarter of those fiscal years; 5) geographic and demographic-targeted digital and print advertising programs sold to third parties; and 6) digital advertising on the stations’ websites, mobile-optimized websites, and apps.
The stations sell commercial time to both local/regional and national advertisers. Rates for spot advertising are influenced primarily by the market size, number of media competitors, including in-market broadcasters, and audience ratings and demographics. Generally, the larger a station’s audience in any particular daypart or program, the higher the advertising rates it can command. As supply and demand fluctuate in the market, so do a station’s 
advertising rates. Independent representative firms sell most national advertising while the sales staff at each station sell local/regional advertising.
Typically, 40 to 60 percent of a market’s television advertising revenue is generated during local newscasts. Stations are continually working to increase the number of newscasts and additionally grow their news ratings, which in turn increase advertising revenues.
Meredith’s 16 national network affiliation agreements also influence advertising rates. A network affiliation agreement provides a station the exclusive right to broadcast network programming in its local service area. In return, the network has the right to sell most of the commercial advertising aired during network programs and receives programming fees from the station.
Retransmission consent revenue is generated from cable, satellite, telecommunications, and over-the-top service providers who pay Meredith for access to our television station signals so that they may retransmit our signals and charge their subscribers for this programming. These fees increased in each of the last three fiscal years, primarily due to renegotiations of expiring contracts and negotiated rate increases on existing contracts effective during the year.
Programming fees paid to the networks are, in essence, a portion of those retransmission consent fees. Programming fees paid to the networks increased 12 percent in fiscal 2021, 15 percent in fiscal 2020, and 20 percent in fiscal 2019 due to renegotiations of expiring contracts.
Stations sometimes also pay networks for certain marquee sports programming (professional football, college basketball, and Olympics) and news services. While Meredith’s relations with the networks historically have been very good, the Company can make no assurances they will remain so over time.
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has permitted broadcast television station licensees to use their digital spectrum for a wide variety of services such as high-definition television programming, audio, data, mobile applications, and other types of communication, subject to the requirement that each broadcaster provide at least one free video channel equal in quality to the current technical standards. All of our stations are broadcasting one or more additional programming streams on their digital channels: one airs the Fox network; two of our markets have MyNetworkTV; ten carry Cozi TV; six broadcast the Court TV Mystery and Circle networks; three air the Bounce and Grit networks; and four air the LAFF, DABL, and Court TV networks.
The costs of television programming are significant. In addition to network fees, there are two principal programming costs for Meredith: locally produced programming, including local news, and purchased syndicated programming. The Company continues to increase our locally produced news and entertainment programming to control content and costs and to attract advertisers. Syndicated programming costs are based largely on demand from stations in the market and can fluctuate significantly.
Local media’s operations also include MNI Targeted Media (MNI). Through MNI, we provide clients with a single point of contact for a range of targeted digital and print advertising programs primarily on a local and regional level. Digital products include programmatic offerings and custom display advertising on local and national websites. Print products include customized geographic and demographic-targeted advertising programs in approximately 35 top U.S. magazines, including our own national media magazines and those of other leading magazine publishers.
Competition
Meredith’s television stations compete directly for advertising dollars and programming in their respective markets with other local television stations, radio stations, cable/satellite systems, newspapers, outdoor advertising, local magazines, direct mail, and their related websites and apps. The stations further compete against these media competitors and other local and national digital media properties. Advertisers compare audience viewership/consumption, market share, audience demographics, and advertising rates, whether local, network, or syndicated, when making advertising decisions.
Regulation
The ownership, operation, and sale of broadcast television stations, including those licensed to the Company, are subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC, which engages in extensive regulation of the broadcasting industry under authority granted by the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (Communications Act), and has the authority to promulgate rules and regulations governing broadcasting. The Communications Act requires broadcasters to serve the public interest. Among other things, the FCC assigns frequency bands; determines stations’ locations and operating parameters; issues, renews, revokes, and modifies station licenses; regulates and limits changes in ownership or control of station licenses; regulates equipment used by stations; regulates station employment practices; regulates certain program and advertising content, including commercial matters in children’s programming; regulates the retransmission of television stations by multichannel video programming distributors; has the authority to impose penalties for violations of its rules or the Communications Act; and imposes annual fees on stations. Reference should be made to the Communications Act, as well as to the FCC’s rules, public notices, and rulings for further information concerning the nature and extent of federal regulation of broadcast stations.
Broadcast licenses are granted for terms of up to eight years. The Communications Act directs the FCC to renew a broadcast license if the station has served the public interest and is in substantial compliance with the provisions of the Communications Act and FCC rules and policies. Management believes the Company is in substantial compliance with all applicable provisions of the Communications Act and FCC rules and policies and knows of no reason why Meredith’s broadcast station licenses will not be renewed.
The FCC has, on occasion, changed the rules related to ownership of media assets, including rules relating to the ownership of one or more television stations in a market. The FCC’s media ownership rules remain subject to further review by the FCC, various court appeals, petitions for reconsideration before the FCC, and possible actions by Congress. We cannot predict the impact of any of these developments on our business.
The Communications Act and the FCC also regulate relationships between television broadcasters and cable, satellite, and telecommunications television providers. Under these provisions, most cable systems must devote a specified portion of their channel capacity to the carriage of the signals of local television stations that elect to exercise this right to mandatory carriage. Alternatively, television stations may elect to restrict cable systems from carrying their signals without their written permission, which is referred to as retransmission consent. Congress and the FCC have established and implemented generally similar market-specific requirements for mandatory carriage of local television stations by satellite television providers when those providers choose to provide a market’s local television signals and grants of retransmission consent to satellite television providers. These rules, including existing related rules on exclusivity and good faith bargaining, and proposed rules governing “over-the-top” carriage by Internet video programming distributors are subject to further review by the FCC and possible actions by Congress. Carriage of local television stations by multichannel video programming distributors is also governed by U.S. copyright law, including the Copyright Act of 1976, as amended, which is subject to revision by Congress and interpretation by the courts. We cannot predict further changes in the laws or rules governing these relationships or the impact of any such developments on our business.
The FCC proposed a plan, called the National Broadband Plan, to increase the amount of spectrum available in the U.S. for wireless broadband use. In furtherance of the National Broadband Plan, Congress authorized the FCC to conduct a “reverse auction” for which television broadcast licensees could submit bids to receive compensation in return for relinquishing all or a portion of their rights in the television spectrum of their full service and/or Class A stations. Under the law, the FCC was permitted to hold one reverse auction and a follow-up auction for the newly freed spectrum. The FCC completed both auctions in calendar year 2017.
Even if a television licensee did not participate in the reverse auction, Congress granted the FCC the authority to force a television station to change channels and/or modify its coverage area to allow the FCC to rededicate certain channels within the television band for wireless broadband use. Following the incentive auction, the FCC released a list of television stations that were required to change their facilities by a specified date as part of this “repacking” process. Several of our stations were among the hundreds of stations selected for repacking of the television band. All our stations selected for repacking completed their move and commenced operations on their new channels on 
or before the FCC’s deadline. We completed the repack in fiscal 2021 and received reimbursements from the FCC’s special fund covering 80 percent of the total cost of the repack.
Congress, certain States, and the FCC have under consideration, and in the future may adopt, new laws, regulations, and policies regarding a wide variety of other matters that also could affect, directly or indirectly, the operation, ownership transferability, and profitability of the Company’s broadcast stations and affect the ability of the Company to acquire additional stations. In addition to the matters noted above, these could include, among other things, spectrum usage fees, regulation of political advertising rates, restrictions on the advertising of certain products (such as pharmaceuticals, alcoholic beverages, or gambling), program content restrictions, and ownership rule changes.
Other matters that could potentially affect the Company’s broadcast properties include, but are not limited to, technological innovations and developments generally affecting competition in the mass communications industry for viewers or advertisers, such as home video recording devices and players, satellite radio and television services, cable television systems, newspapers, outdoor advertising, and internet-delivered video programming services. For example, the FCC approved a proposal to allow the voluntary transition of television broadcasters to ATSC 3.0, known as Next Generation Television. We launched one of the first ATSC 3.0 transitions in Portland, Oregon. We cannot predict whether or how this process will ultimately affect the Company or our television stations.
Large mass communication transactions have also increased the scrutiny of federal and state antitrust enforcement on the mass communications industry. The Company, along with other major broadcasters, is subject to a Consent Decree with the U.S. Department of Justice entered in 2019 restricting the exchange of pacing and other information between stations. In entering the Consent Decree, the Company did not admit liability and was not required to pay any fine or other penalty. We cannot predict whether or how this Consent Decree will ultimately affect the broadcast industry, the Company, or our television stations.
The information provided in this section is not intended to be inclusive of all regulatory provisions currently in effect. Statutory provisions and FCC regulations are subject to change, and any such changes could affect future operations and profitability of the Company’s local media segment. Management cannot predict what regulations or legislation may be adopted, nor can management estimate the effect any such changes would have on the Company’s television broadcasting operations.

HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES
Meredith operates under the guiding principle that our employees are the Company’s most important resource. Our human resources initiatives are therefore designed to attract, develop, and retain a diverse group of highly qualified employees who embody values such as integrity, creativity, courage, initiative, passion, energy, teamwork, inclusiveness, and respect for others. We focus on both the end result of an employee’s work, as well as how that end result is achieved. Our culture at Meredith is centered on workplace community, collaboration, communication, and a shared sense of purpose.
Workforce Demographics
As of June 30, 2021, Meredith had approximately 5,050 full-time and 70 part-time employees of whom approximately 4,750 were located in the U.S., approximately 365 in India, and approximately 5 in other locations. Less than 10 percent of our workforce is unionized. We have various arrangements with our international employees that we believe to be customary for multinational corporations. We have had no strikes or work stoppages during the last five years and consider relations with our employees to be good.
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
We have published detailed workforce diversity statistics in our Corporate Social Responsibility Report, available on our website. The following reflects selected diversity data for our employees. As of June 30, 2021, 59.1 percent of our workforce identifies as women and 24.4 percent as people of color. In fiscal 2021, 59.6 percent of new hires were women and 41.1 percent of new hires were people of color.
Diversity, equity, and inclusion are at the heart of Meredith’s core values, and we have made it a priority to foster a work environment where every employee feels welcomed and valued. We are committed to these components of our diversity efforts: 
•Increasing employee diversity across the organization; 
•Facilitating inclusion efforts within the workplace;
•Creating education and awareness opportunities; and 
•Effectively communicating our diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives and strategies inside and outside of the organization.
We believe having a diverse organization will create even greater results and allow us to better serve our increasingly diverse consumer base.
We believe in and strive for an environment based on respect for all individuals, and we provide equal employment opportunity to all people, regardless of race, color, national origin/ethnicity, gender identity/gender expression, creed, religion, age, disability, sexual orientation, marital status, military service, or any other characteristic.
We created a Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion team led by a Vice President, Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion and that team, supported by our Employee Resource Groups, is responsible for connecting current activities to a larger Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion strategy that we believe will allow us to continually embed these principles into all of our functions. This strategy is focused around the pillars of Education, Recruitment, Retention, and Communication, which are discussed in more detail in our Corporate Social Responsibility Report.
Talent Management
In addition to our Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion initiatives, we prioritize our people and the communities in which we operate in several ways, including:
•Compensation and Benefits. We deliver a total rewards package (compensation and benefits) to attract, retain, and motivate our employees. Competitive compensation is a Meredith cornerstone, and we have strong practices in place to support the well-being of all employees. Our pay programs are designed to recognize and reward individual performance. We participate annually in industry surveys to benchmark our pay programs and ensure overall pay levels are commensurate with the marketplace. We utilize outside consultants to conduct pay studies to ensure compensation is administered fairly and equitably across all employees. We also offer a broad slate of competitive employee benefits, including, but not limited to, a 401(k) plan with a generous Company matching contribution and no vesting requirement, an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, tuition reimbursement, an education loan program for parents, a student-loan refinancing program for employees and family members, generous time off policies, as well as robust health benefits and an extensive and award-winning health and financial wellness program available to employees and their spouses/domestic partners. Meredith also offers virtual and onsite healthcare consultation through its health centers in Des Moines and New York. Finally, in addition to our own corporate donations to nonprofit organizations, we also offer to match employee donations (up to $5,000 each fiscal year for each employee) and contribute funds based on hours employees volunteer with qualifying charities.
•Employee Engagement. In order to better inform the development of, and the resulting impact from, our human resources initiatives, we survey our employees periodically to monitor their satisfaction and engagement. The most recent employee survey was distributed in September 2020 and covered a range of topics, including Productivity & Collaboration; Transparency & Communication; Employee Well-Being and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. Additionally, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer regularly communicates with and responds to employee questions and concerns in Company-wide town hall meetings, with questions and answers posted on the Company’s intranet following meetings. In each case, the feedback is carefully reviewed by our human resources team and used to develop and refine our human resources initiatives.
•Talent Development and Training. Meredith prides itself on having a culture of highly engaged employees, which we believe is largely driven by our approach to performance management. We have a tried-and-true approach, which starts with employees collaborating with their managers to set meaningful, actionable, and impactful goals at the beginning of the year. Throughout the year, managers and employees have regular dialogue regarding progress against those goals. At the end of the year, employees and managers complete a performance appraisal, which includes a discussion about goal attainment. It is a two-way conversation where employees are encouraged to provide their manager feedback on how he, she, or they can best support day-to-day activities and interactions while helping employees achieve their longer-term career goals. This approach enhances employee engagement but also ensures that performance standards are applied fairly and reasonably and that they maintain a focus on continuous improvement. Demonstrated successful performance is rewarded with appropriate increases in pay and promotional opportunities, when they arise. In addition to performance management, we know that employees capable of motivating and 
developing others have a significant positive impact on employee performance, retention, engagement, and overall business performance. We designed a learning portal with engaging video-based learning for all employees that focuses on growth and career development. We believe our employee development and training programs are an important investment in Meredith’s future.
COVID-19 Response
We have adopted a multi-pronged approach to managing the COVID-19 pandemic. Much of our focus has been on deploying timely and engaging content, deep consumer connections, and broad reach to provide important communications, inspire families to make the most of their time at home, and help consumers – and Meredith employees – manage the stress associated with this unprecedented situation. For our employees, in particular, our extensive and award-winning wellness program has provided important resources to them and their families in order to help them manage their physical, mental, and financial health during this crisis. We have taken the following actions to help protect the health, safety, and well-being of our employees in response to the COVID-19 pandemic:
•We moved all nonessential employees to a remote work environment and implemented additional safety measures for all essential employees, including the provision of necessary protective equipment, the creation of sanitizing locations, daily entry questionnaires, trainings, and the adoption of distancing and testing protocols to align with regulatory guidelines.
•We provided Telehealth benefits at no cost to employees through September 2020.
•We offered additional assistance with back-up dependent care, including reimbursement for emergency childcare expenses, and additional paid time off for employees with children at home due to schools and childcare providers closing.
•We provided employees access to a free 12-month premium membership to MyLife, a meditation app designed to help individuals manage their stress.
•We co-facilitated a series of Company-wide discussions about developing strategies for self-care during turbulent times with our Employee Assistance Program, which also hosts free webinars about managing stress and offers employees 24/7 confidential access to professional counselors.
•In an effort to encourage employees to get vaccinated, we secured partnerships with pharmacies and vaccine clinics in our Des Moines and Birmingham locations, and provided paid time off for employees to receive their COVID-19 vaccines.
