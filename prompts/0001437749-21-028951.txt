Employees and Human Capital Resources
 
As of October 31, 2021, we employed a total of 322 persons (excluding independent sales representatives and firms). Our employees are all located in the United States and are not represented by unions. We have experienced no work stoppages and we continue to take steps we believe appropriate to ensure our employee relations are good.
 
   7 

 

We continue to monitor our demand for skilled and unskilled labor and provide training and competitive compensation packages in an effort to attract and retain skilled employees. We believe our employees are key to achieving our business goals and growth strategy. Our human capital measures and objectives focus on safety of our employees, employee benefits and employee development and training. All of our employees are at-will employees, which means that each employee can terminate his or her relationship with us and we can terminate our relationship with him or her at any time.
 
We have experienced, and could continue to experience, some difficulty in identifying and hiring skilled labor, particularly in manufacturing, as a result of COVID-19 concerns and other related factors. These concerns have decreased the pool of available qualified talent for certain functions. As a result, we have made and continue to make strong efforts to recruit qualified talent. While we believe our compensation and benefits offerings position us for success against a limited labor pool, we continue to be mindful of the labor shortages and are committed to being competitive to retain the best talent possible.
 
During fiscal year 2021, there have been periods during which we have asked groups or individual employees at each of our facilities to quarantine at home as a precautionary measure (per guidelines provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) against the possible transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus during the pandemic. We have taken, and continue to take, measures to protect the health and safety of our employees during the pandemic—including requirements regarding wearing masks, social distancing, sanitation procedures, and symptom checks. We are not aware of any COVID-19 illnesses resulting from possible virus exposure at any of our facilities.
 
Seasonality
 
We typically expect net sales to be relatively lower in the first half of each fiscal year and relatively higher in the second half of each fiscal year, and excluding other volatility, we would normally expect 48% of total net sales to occur during the first half of a fiscal year and 52% of total net sales to occur during the second half of a fiscal year. We believe this historical seasonality pattern is generally indicative of an overall trend and reflective of the buying patterns and budgetary cycles of our customers. However, this pattern may be substantially altered during any quarter or year, as was the case in fiscal years 2020 and 2019, by the quarterly and annual volatility of orders received for the wireless carrier market, the timing of larger projects, timing of orders from larger customers, other economic factors impacting our industry or impacting the industries of our customers and end-users, and macroeconomic conditions. Along these same lines, we believe our seasonality pattern in fiscal year 2021 was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in lower net sales at the start of the fiscal year and higher net sales beginning in the second quarter of the fiscal year as some restrictions were lifted and certain markets reopened. Consequently, while we believe seasonality may be a factor that impacts our quarterly net sales results, we are not able to reliably predict net sales based on seasonality because these other factors can also substantially impact our net sales patterns and volatility during the year. Our trend for the last three fiscal years has been that an average of approximately 47%, 50% and 50% of our total net sales occurred during the first half of fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and an average of approximately 53%, 50% and 50% of our total net sales occurred during the second half of fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
