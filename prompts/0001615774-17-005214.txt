ITEM 1.          BUSINESS
Overview
 
Akoustis is an early stage company focused on developing, designing and manufacturing innovative radio frequency (RF) filter products for the mobile wireless device industry. We use a patented fundamentally new piezoelectric resonator technology that we call BulkONE® in the manufacturing of bulk acoustic wave (BAW) resonators, the building blocks of high selectivity “RF” filters required to route signals in a smartphone or other mobile or wearable device, cellular infrastructure and WiFi routers. Filters are a critical component of the RF front-end (RFFE), and their use has multiplied with the launch and licensing of 4G/LTE, emerging 5G and WiFi frequency bands. They are used to define the range of frequencies of radio signals that are transmitted (the “passband”) and simultaneously reject unwanted signals.


We plan to use single-crystal piezoelectric materials to develop a new class of BAW RF filters with a fundamental advantage to reduce losses over existing thin film RF filter technologies. We believe our technology will be disruptive to the RFFE market through the following expected advantages:
 

● | Wider bandwidth coverage, 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Smaller filter supports higher level of integration and lower manufacturing costs,


● | Lower insertion loss, 
--+--------------------------


● | Improved power compression and linearity, 
--+----------------------------------------------


● | Reduced power amplifier cost, for the ultimate purpose of manufacturing our BAW RF filters, 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Reduced heat generation and reduced battery loading, and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


● | Reduced guard band between adjacent frequency bands. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------

 
Once our technology is qualified for mass production, we expect to design and sell single-crystal BAW RF filter products using our BulkONE® technology. Our product focus is on innovative single-band filter products for the growing smartphone and RFFE module market, which can be used to make duplexer or multiplexer filter products necessary for the mobile market. These products present the greatest near-term potential for commercialization of our technology. According to a Mobile Experts May 2016 report, the mobile filter market is expected to grow from $8.2 billion in 2017 to greater than $12 billion by 2021.
 
Recent Developments
 
Business Developments
 
In August 2016, we announced our first customer engagement when we entered into multiple non-exclusive agreements with a Chinese tier one RFFE module manufacturer to supply it with our premium RF filter products for next-generation high-band RFFE modules for 4G, emerging 4.5G and 5G mobile - targeting the China and India OEM markets. In December 2016, we announced our second customer engagement, this time for the development of a band-specific, high-frequency (above 3.5 GHz) BAW RF filter for a non-mobile commercial application with a well-established OEM, specializing in non-mobile defense systems, with annual revenues of more than $1 billion.  In May 2017, we announced our third customer engagement, this time for the development of high-performance BAW duplexers for non-mobile communication systems with a multi-billion dollar U.S. Fortune 500 company that provides systems, products and solutions to government and commercial customers worldwide.

On March 23, 2017, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement and a Real Property Purchase Agreement (collectively, the “STC-MEMS Agreements”) with The Research Foundation for the State University of New York (“RF-SUNY”) and Fuller Road Management Corporation (“FRMC”), an affiliate of RF-SUNY (collectively, “Sellers”), respectively, to acquire certain specified assets, including STC-MEMS, a semiconductor wafer-manufacturing and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) operation with associated wafer-manufacturing tools, and the associated real estate and improvements located in Canandaigua, New York used in the operation of STC-MEMS (the assets and real estate and improvements referred to together herein as the “STC-MEMS Business”). Pursuant to the STC-MEMS Agreements, the Company also agreed to assume post acquisition date substantially all of the ongoing obligations of the STC-MEMS Business incurred in the ordinary course of business.
 
We completed the acquisition of the STC-MEMS Business through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Akoustis Manufacturing New York, Inc., a Delaware corporation formed in connection with the acquisition, on June 26, 2017 for an aggregate purchase price of $2.8 million in cash. The Company recorded net assets acquired of $6.3 million for purchase consideration of $4.6 million (includes $2.85 million of cash paid at closing plus $1.7m real estate contingent liability), which resulted in the recording of a bargain purchase gain of $1.7 million. The Company reviewed what factors might contribute to a bargain purchase to determine if it was reasonable for a bargain purchase to occur. We determined the factors that contributed to the bargain purchase price were:
 

● | The transaction was completed with a motivated seller who the Company believed was very hesitant to liquidate assets and lay-off employees in the current political environment. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The cash burn of the facility (approximately $3.0 million annually) was an economic burden to the sellers. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The Company, the County and State were motivated to approve the transaction without significant price negotiation, as they believed it would insure the employment of the headcount and provide the opportunity for increased headcount and increased investment in the facility that would add to the tax base. 

 
Based upon these factors, the Company concluded that the occurrence of a bargain purchase was reasonable.
 
The STC-MEMs acquisition allows the Company to internalize manufacturing, increase capacity and control its wafer supply chain for single crystal BAW RF filters. We have now successfully transferred our R&D resonator filter process flow into the facility, and we plan to utilize the facility to optimize our BulkONE® technology and to consolidate all aspects of wafer manufacturing for our disruptive and patented high band BAW RF filters targeting the multi-billion dollar mobile and other wireless markets. This planned consolidation of the Company’s supply chain into the STC-MEMS Business started on June 26, 2017 and is expected to shorten time-to-market for our RF products, greatly enhancing our ability to service customers upon completion of development and design specifications. Furthermore, we believe that shorter time-to-market cycles provide us with the opportunity to increase the number of our potential customers.
 
In August 2017, we announced our first shipment of premium high-band BAW RF filter prototypes manufactured using our patented single-crystal BulkONE® technology to the aforementioned Chinese tier one customer. The shipment included high performance, LTE-TDD Band 41, 2.6 GHz BAW RF filters that we believe will satisfy the challenging filter requirements in the high growth 4G LTE mobile market in China. Shortly thereafter, we announced our first 3.5GHz RF filter shipments to our second customer for a key Radar application.
 
Organizational Developments
 
On August 11, 2016, we changed our fiscal year from a fiscal year ending on March 31 of each year to one ending on June 30 of each year, effective for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017. On October 31, 2016, we filed a transition report on Form 10-K for the transition period from April 1, 2016 to June 30, 2016.
 
Following stockholder approval at our 2016 annual stockholders’ meeting, we changed our state of incorporation from the State of Nevada to the State of Delaware on December 15, 2016.

Our Technology
 
Current RF filters utilize a technology that is limited by the material properties of the base filter component. Existing BAW filters use an “acoustic wave ladder” that is based on a monolithic topology approach using lossy polycrystalline materials. By contrast, our BulkONE® technology uses a single-crystal material, which provides 30% higher piezoelectric properties, compared to conventional polycrystalline materials used in the industry today. We have fabricated R&D resonators that demonstrate the feasibility of our approach and believe our technology will yield a new generation of filter products.
 
BulkONE® technology consists of novel single-crystal piezoelectric materials, which are fabricated into bulk-mode, acoustic wave resonators and RF filters. Our patented piezoelectric materials contain high-purity Group III element nitride materials and possess a unique signature, which can be detected by conventional material metrology tools. We utilize analytical modeling techniques to aid in the design of our materials, and our raw material specifications are typically outsourced to a third party for manufacturing. Once our materials are ready for processing, we supply our NY fabrication facility raw materials, a mask design file, and unique process sequence in order to fabricate our resonators and filters. Our wafer process flow is compatible with wafer level packaging (WLP) that allows for low profile, cost effective filters to be produced.
 
Challenges Facing the Mobile Device Industry
 
Rising consumer demand for always-on wireless broadband connectivity is creating an unprecedented need for high performance RFFE for mobile devices. Mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets are quickly becoming the primary means of accessing the Internet, thereby driving the Internet of Things (IoT). The rapid growth in mobile data traffic is testing the limits of existing wireless bandwidth. Carriers and regulators have responded by opening new spectrums of RF frequencies, driving up the number of frequency bands in mobile devices. This substantial increase in frequency bands has created a demand for more filters, as well as a demand for filters with higher selectivity. The global transition to LTE and adoption of LTE-Advanced with more sophisticated carrier aggregation and multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) techniques will continue to push the requirements for increased supply of high performance filters.
 
Furthermore, the new spectrum introduced by 4G/LTE and emerging 5G is driving spectrum licensing at higher frequencies than previous 3G smartphone models. For example, new TDD LTE frequencies allocated for 4G wireless cover frequencies nearly twice as high as those covered in previous generation phones. As a result, the demand for filters represents the single largest growth opportunity in the RFFE industry according to a Mobile Experts May 2016 report. For traditional “low band” frequencies, SAW filters have been the primary choice, while high band solutions have utilized BAW filters due to their performance and yield. While there are multiple sources of supply for SAW technology, the source of supply for BAW filters is more limited and essentially dominated by two manufacturers worldwide. See “Competition” below.

In addition, signal loss of current generation acoustic wave filters is excessively high, and up to half of the transmit power is wasted as heat, which ultimately constrains battery life. Another challenge is that the allocated spectrum for mobile communication bands requires high bandwidth RF filters, which, in turn, requires wide bandwidth core resonator technology. In addition, filters with inferior selectivity either reduce the available operating bands the mobile device can support or increase the noise in the operating bands. Each of these problems negatively impacts the end-user’s experience when using the mobile device.
 
The RFFE must meet growing data demands while reducing cost and improving battery life. Our solution involves a new approach to RFFE component manufacturing, enabled by BulkONE® technology. We expect our technology to produce filters that will reduce the overall system cost and improve performance of the RFFE.
 
Our Solutions
 
Our immediate focus is on the commercialization of wide bandwidth RF filters operating in the high frequency portion of the RFFE (called high band). Using our BulkONE® technology, we believe these filters enable new PAD module or RFFE competition for high band modules as well as performance-driven low band applications. Initially, we expect to target select strategic RFFE market leaders as well as tier two mobile phone original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and/or RFFE module suppliers. Longer term, our focus will be to expand our market share by engaging with multiple mobile phone OEMs and RFFE module manufacturers. We have transitioned our technology to our Canandaigua, NY facility and continue to focus on the commercialization of our filters using our BulkONE® technology. This will be the first in a series of R&D activities that will set the foundation for filter products that we believe can disrupt the high band filter market. We will develop a series of filter designs to be used in the manufacturing of duplexers or more complex multiplexers targeting the 4G/LTE and emerging 5G frequency bands. We believe our filter designs will create an alternative for, and replace, filters currently manufactured using materials with fundamentally inferior performance. Figure 1 below illustrates characterization plots that represent the high power, high bandwidth and high frequency capability of our single crystal materials.
 
Figure 1-Characteristics of our single crystal materials used to fabricate our BAW RF filters.
 

Single-Band Designs for Duplexers and Multiplexers
 
SAW filters have been preferred in modern RFFE because of their high performance, small size and low cost. However, traditional SAW ladder designs do not perform well in high frequency bands or bands with closely spaced receive and transmit channels, typical of many new bands. Therefore, BAW filters are needed for these bands. We have demonstrated in a development environment our ability to fabricate BAW resonators, the building block of BAW filters, that are more efficient than existing available BAW resonators, and we believe the improved efficiency will reduce the total cost of RFFE as well as reduce the battery demand for mobile devices. Additionally, we believe that our BulkONE® filters will allow for a single manufacturing method that will support all of the BAW filter band range and a significant portion of the SAW band range. Figure 2 below illustrates what we believe will be the frequency range of our BulkONE® technology.

Pure-Play Filter Provider Enables New Module Competition
 
Given the high sound velocity in our piezoelectric materials, our technology allows for a wide range of frequency coverage, and we plan to supply filters that will support 4G/LTE, emerging 5G and WiFi bands. We have successfully demonstrated resonators that will support the design and fabrication of 4G/LTE filters, and our current focus is on completing the development required to transition this single-crystal BAW technology to high volume manufacturing. We will be a pure-play filter supplier that will address the increasing RF complexity placed on RFFE manufacturers supporting 4G/LTE and WiFi. Figure 3 illustrates the historical growth in RF complexity.

 Commercialization
 
Our immediate focus is on the commercialization of wide bandwidth RF filters to address the RFFE with innovative single-band designs using our BulkONE® high band spectrum technology. We are currently developing our first commercial single-band filter through our STC-MEMS Business wafer fabrication facility. We are focused on developing fixed-band filters because we believe these designs present the greatest near-term potential for commercialization of our technology, and that once demonstrated, the STC-MEMS facility can be more efficiently readied for production compared to alternative technologies.

Research and Development
 
Since inception, the Company’s focus has been on developing an innovative mobile-wireless filter technology with a compelling value proposition to our potential customers and a significant and noticeable impact to the end user. Whereas today’s polycrystalline material (used to manufacture RF resonators and filters) is sputtered on a metal-coated carrier, our patented BulkONE® technology employs high quality, single-crystal resonator films, which are used as the enabler to create high performance BAW RF filters. This single-crystal material is a key differentiator when compared to the incumbent amorphous thin-film technologies because it increases the acoustic velocity and the electromechanical coupling coefficient in the resonator, which results in higher filter efficiencies and lower power consumption, leading to simplified RFFEs, longer battery life, reduced tissue heating, and ultimately lower manufacturing costs. Research and development expense totaled $ 4,425,778 for the year ended June 30, 2017 and $1,758,701 for the year ended June 30, 2016. These R&D activities focused on single-crystal material development and resonator demonstration. Current R&D investments include single-crystal materials advancement, technology transfer to our manufacturing partner and resonator development and filter design.
 
As a result of our efforts, we developed and recently published a measured filter designed for 3.5GHz to 3.9GHz applications. Our focus is now on improving the electromechanical coupling and quality factor of our resonator technology and the performance of our fabricated filters through design improvements and process optimization experiments.
 
In addition, we are developing technology for filters applications at frequencies greater than 5GHz. The performance of early work on resonators resonating at 5.798GHz was presented at a technical conference showing an electromechanical coupling coefficient (k2eff ) of 6.5%, obtained after de-embedding resonator characteristics from measured data.
 
Figure 4- Akoustis’ single crystal undoped AIN piezoelectric technology based 3.7GHz filter performance. The plot shows measured narrow band S21 and S11 for the fabricated 3.7GHz filter, showing minimum insertion loss of approximately 2.dB.



Raw Materials
 
Within its internal manufacturing operation, Akoustis sources raw materials, process gases, metals and other miscellaneous supplies to fabricate its BAW RF filter circuits.  Materials range from substrates (used to deposit key piezoelectric materials) to standard dielectric-based laminates (used for packaging of the RF filter circuits). The Company sources at least two types of substrate materials for its BAW process and the Company has more than one supplier for each material type. Multiple process gases are used for material synthesis, process etching and wafer treatment.  While there is more than one supplier for most process gases, the purity levels of such gases may change by source.  Hence, either purification or process requalification may be required, as purchase from a second source is required.  Akoustis sources various high purity metals for electrode formation and interconnect layers for its RF circuits.  Such metals are available in various purity levels and are available from more than one supplier.  Other process handling hardware common to the semiconductor industry is available in abundance from multiple suppliers. Consistent with other semiconductor manufacturers, the Company may have to work with all its suppliers to ensure adequate supply of raw materials, process gases and metals as the Company ramps from R&D into high volume manufacturing.

Intellectual Property
 
We rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents and trade secrets, along with copyrights, trademarks and contractual obligations and restrictions to protect our core technology and business.
 
In the United States and internationally we have fourteen (14) patents, of which three (3) patents are the subject to a license agreement requiring further negotiation, in addition to sixteen (16) pending patent applications. Our intellectual property relates directly to our single-crystal BAW technology, including materials and device designs, methods of manufacture, integrated circuit designs, wafer packaging, and point of use (to include mobile applications). Our patents expire between 2031 and 2033. We intend to continue to innovate and expand our patent portfolio, and when appropriate, we will look to purchase license(s) that grant access to additional intellectual property that enables, enhances or further expands our technical capabilities and/or product.
 
We believe that it is likely that Akoustis will have competitive advantages from rights granted under our patent applications. Some applications, however, may not result in the issuance of any patents. In addition, any future patent may be opposed, contested, circumvented or designed around by a third party or found to be unenforceable or invalidated. Others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our proprietary technologies, duplicate our proprietary technologies or design around patents owned or licensed by us.
 
We generally control access to, and use of, our confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors and customers. We rely in part on the United States and international copyright laws to protect our intellectual property.

Akoustis and BulkONE are trademarks of Akoustis, Inc.
 
Competition
 
The RF filter market is controlled by a relatively small number of RF component suppliers. These companies include, among others, Broadcom (previously known as Avago Technologies Ltd.), Murata Manufacturing Co., Ltd., Qorvo, Inc., Skyworks Solutions Inc., Taiyo Yuden, and TDK Epcos. Broadcom and Qorvo, Inc. dominate the high band BAW filter market, controlling a significant portion of the customer base and are increasing capacity to meet the growing RF filter demand of the 4G/LTE market.
 
Upon completion of our product development, we will compete directly with these companies to secure design slots inside RFFE modules - targeting companies that procure filters or internally source filters. While many of our competitors have more resources than we have, we believe that our filter designs will be superior in performance, and we will approach prospective customers as a pure-play filter supplier, offering advantages in performance over the full frequency range at competitive costs. Our challenge will be to convince our customers that we have a strong intellectual property position, we will be able to deliver in volume, that we will meet their price targets, and that we can satisfy reliability and other requirements. For a list of other competitive factors, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors — We are still developing our products, and they may not be accepted in the market.”

Employees
 
We place an emphasis on hiring the best talent at the right time to enable our core technology and business growth. This includes establishing a competitive compensation and benefits package, thereby enhancing our ability to recruit experienced personnel and key technologists. We currently have a total of 58 full-time employees plus 5 part-time employees, including 33 full-time employees located in the Canandaigua NY facility and 25 full-time and 5 part-time employees in our North Carolina facility. We will continue to hire specific and targeted positions to further enable our technology and manufacturing capabilities as and when appropriate.
Government Regulations
 
Our business and products in development are subject to regulation by various federal and state governmental agencies, including the radio frequency emission regulatory activities of the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”), the consumer protection laws of the Federal Trade Commission, the import/export regulatory activities of the Department of Commerce, the product safety regulatory activities of the Consumer Products Safety Commission, and the environmental regulatory activities of the Environmental Protection Agency.
 
The rules and regulations of the FCC limit the RF used by, and level of power emitting from, electronic equipment. Our RF filters, as a key element enabling consumer electronic smartphone equipment, are required to comply with these FCC rules and may require certification, verification or registration of our RF filters with the FCC. Certification and verification of new equipment requires testing to ensure the equipment’s compliance with the FCC’s rules. The equipment must be labeled according to the FCC’s rules to show compliance with these rules. Testing, processing of the FCC’s equipment certificate or FCC registration and labeling may increase development and production costs and could delay the implementation of our BulkONE® acoustic wave resonator technology for our RF filters and the launch and commercial productions of our filters into the U.S. market. Electronic equipment permitted or authorized to be used by us through FCC certification or verification procedures must not cause harmful interference to licensed FCC users, and may be subject to RF interference from licensed FCC users. Selling, leasing or importing non-compliant equipment is considered a violation of FCC rules and federal law, and violators may be subject to an enforcement action by the FCC. Any failure to comply with the applicable rules and regulations of the FCC could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition by increasing our compliance costs and/or limiting our sales in the United States.
 
The semiconductor and electronics industries also have been subject to increasing environmental regulations. A number of domestic and foreign jurisdictions seek to restrict the use of various substances, a number of which have been used in our products in development or processes. While we have implemented a compliance program to ensure our product offering meets these regulations, there may be instances where alternative substances will not be available or commercially feasible, or may only be available from a single source, or may be significantly more expensive than their restricted counterparts. Additionally, if we were found to be non-compliant with any such rule or regulation, we could be subject to fines, penalties and/or restrictions imposed by government agencies that could adversely affect our operating results. Our cost to maintain compliance with existing environmental regulations is expected to be nominal based on our structure in which we outsource a majority of our operations to suppliers that are responsible for meeting environmental regulations. We will continue to monitor our quality program and expand as required to maintain compliance and ability to audit our supply chain.
 
Noncompliance with applicable regulations or requirements could subject us to investigations, sanctions, mandatory product recalls, enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, fines, damages, civil and criminal penalties, or injunctions. An adverse outcome in any such litigation could require us to pay contractual damages, compensatory damages, punitive damages, attorneys’ fees and costs. These enforcement actions could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. If any governmental sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In addition, responding to any action will likely result in a significant diversion of management’s attention and resources and an increase in professional fees.
