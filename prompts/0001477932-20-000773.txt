ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
OVERVIEW

eDoorways Corporation, Inc. (the “Company”, “eDoorways,” “we” or “us”) was originally incorporated in the state of Delaware on February 26, 1988 under the name Technicraft Financial Ltd. In October 1991, the name was changed to LBM-US, Inc. In a reverse merger in August of 1994, the company acquired GK Intelligent Systems, Inc. and the Company adopted such name. In 2006, the Company changed its name to eDoorways Corporation, Inc.

We are a web-based service provider aimed at America’s “net-generation” computer users. As a web based “Town Square”, we aim to provide businesses and consumers with a platform for exchanging ideas, services and products within a highly technologically sophisticated social networking environment. eDoorways intends to offer a way to identify, locate and engage a varying array of resources (both locally and globally) that will provide for advanced problem solving, enhanced learning, conceptualizing and taking ideas to completion, intelligent searches resulting in finding hard-to-get information, or buying and selling items through sophisticated ecommerce networks.

We intend to capitalize on current Web 2.0 community democratic Internet service offerings like MySpace , Craig’s List , and Wikipedia . We are also incorporating emerging Web 3.0 software technologies. Through Web 3.0, we believe that we will possess a global reach and commerce potential that exceeds current service offerings on the Internet. We intend to offer today’s generation of web users a highly collaborative personal and work space that fosters new levels of achievement and creativity.

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

As part of our initial service offering, we are creating a web-based consumer problem solving gateway, lifestyle information source and online business-to-consumer marketplace designed to save the consumer valuable time and money by uniting him/her with the global consumer community, retailers, and manufacturers in an effective new way. The service offering, or “doorway”, is called “SOLVE.” The SOLVE doorway will serve as a central forum for new media e-commerce business-to-consumer product marketing, customer support and distribution. We are targeting SOLVE to become a resource for anyone who is actively engaged in pursuing a lifestyle - whether it’s home improvement, gardening, rebuilding old cars, or sports. SOLVE will assist the general public in solving daily problems. It also will assist the general public in buying those things that are most important and relevant to its needs and interests.

SOLVE could offer a wide range of businesses a unique opportunity to present their products and services to a broader market. The “storefronts” that businesses establish on SOLVE will be predicated on the concept that they are bringing relevant expert assistance to consumers at their critical moment of need. This will give our business clients a chance to build clientele and strengthen their brand by engaging consumers through service and support. In doing so, such businesses will have a new way to not only retain current customers, but also reach potential new customers, close the sale, and build a long-standing relationship.

Example of a Typical “SOLVE” Transaction

Imagine that your hot water heater in your home is not working correctly. Unfortunately, troubleshooting malfunctioning hot water heaters is not your area of expertise. To garner the information you need, you enter the eDoorways gateway on your laptop computer. Inside eDoorways, you’re escorted to the Home Improvement lifestyle area where you’re able to review in-depth and comprehensive information about your problem supplied and maintained by others in the democratic community who have relevant expertise. Next, you choose to speak with subject matter experts representing home improvement products and service vendors who offer to lend a hand. You select a local vendor who introduces John, the hot water heater troubleshooting expert. With John’s knowledgeable guidance and support, you gain the expertise necessary to diagnose the nature of the problem - a worn out coil. John offers to have a new one sent over immediately from their store down the street, or they can have it waiting for you to pick up. However, you decide that maybe its time for a new and larger 75 gallon heater. John points you to their water heater manufacturer’s representative, who assists you in making a purchase choice. Shortly thereafter, the new heater is on its way to your home.

The example above narrowly describes how the “SOLVE” doorway of eDoorways can be of service. However, we believe that SOLVE’s capabilities are far greater than described above, offering real-time group problem solving and collaborative capabilities and many other features.

We will offer two synergistic service components to drive the SOLVE sub-brand:


1. | A performance support feature that assists consumers in resolving current lifestyle problems and issues on a real-time collaborative basis; and
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | An e-marketplace where vendors are allowed to establish “storefronts” where they can communicate directly with consumers.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


These two service elements will be uniquely combined into a single, seamless interface to provide an environment designed to foster collaborative teamwork between the consumer, other members of the broader consumer community, retailers, and manufacturers.

SOLVE will be first and foremost a problem solver, allowing “lifestyle consumers” to quickly research and assess their problem (like installing brake pads on the car, or planting the right landscape at home) with the aid and valuable knowledge of thousands of others who have a solution at hand that they’re willing to share. The idea is to put the consumer in a unique problem-solving environment that can effectively assist him/her in obtaining the right solution and acquiring the resources (i.e., products and services) necessary to put the solution in motion. To do this, we make the consumer, relevant retailers and manufacturers, and the consuming public as a whole (who have contextual experience potentially valuable to the person with the problem) part of a single goal-oriented team.

With its second service component of the SOLVE, eDoorways will be an e-commerce business-to-consumer marketplace. Once the consumer has a solution at hand, retailers/manufacturers can help him/her acquire necessary products/services quickly and conveniently. Manufacturers also can assist the consumer by offering context-relevant information, guidance and support, promotional offers and the business-to-consumer tools geared to solve the consumer’s problem.

Today, eDoorways is prepared to launch with the introduction of SOLVE. The soft launch date for SOLVE has been announced as October 1, 2009. We are continuing our software development activities to accomplish this objective. We are also engaged in service pre-marketing activities. Between the soft and beta launches, we will actively market SOLVE to small businesses and consumers in the Austin regional area. We will take the initial feedback we receive from the soft launch via focus group testing and testimonials to make any necessary modifications before the beta launch. The beta launch of SOLVE is scheduled to occur before the end of 2009. At that time, we will “go live”, making the SOLVE service offering available for the Austin marketplace.

Features & Benefits

Key differentiators of the SOLVE service offering will be increased consumer empowerment through a higher level of engagement with retailers, manufacturers and other consumers, and a stronger orientation toward customer service and improved ways for retailers to identify prospects and close the sale. These can be explained as follows.

· | Offers new perspectives about lifestyles they would never have thought to ask about;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Provides consumers with context-specific expertise for solving practical daily problems related to health, the home, family, etc.;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SOLVE will also benefit vendors because it:


· | Serves as a new platform for business commerce, delivering targeted “gold nugget” prospects (consumers) to vendors. Offers vendors a forum for demonstrating credibility and an avenue for closing the prospective customer;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Provides a robust environment for CRM and targeted marketing. Creates an avenue for personalized engagement and relationship building;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Allows businesses of all types and sizes to engage in the global market and compete with much larger, established entities;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Offers emerging companies an opportunity to compete with the market-share leaders in their industry, and grow their revenues without an enormous investment in physical infrastructure;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Offers market-share leaders a unique, affordable opportunity to attract additional new customers and more importantly, an avenue to cement a long-term relationship with existing customers by making services available 24/7/365;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Offers businesses a way to drive consumer traffic to brick-and-mortar facilities, and;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Reinforces the concept that businesses can offer true customer service and genuine solutions.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Technologies Used to Provide Services

We believe that the initial SOLVE service offering will be accomplished through the integration of the following software technologies:


· | “Targeting” software - used to pinpoint consumers’ physical location and market availability; available from numerous vendors.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | “Push” software - used to drive “permission” marketing campaigns of our partners; available from numerous vendors.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Systems integration software - used to “manage” all of the above; available from numerous vendors.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Intelligent search software – used to assist consumers in obtaining timely and relevant solutions to their problems, both within the context of the moment and over a long period of time.


· | “Intelligent” teaching software - our proprietary expert systems based educational software; to be updated and revised to accommodate recent advances in presentation and transmission capabilities.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

eDOORWAYS’ “Intelligent” Teaching Technology

We developed our “intelligent” teaching technology in a previous incarnation of the company approximately 10 years ago. At that time, the teaching technology established itself as an internationally known brand that received numerous awards for technical and marketing excellence. It is our intent to use the technology as part of our SOLVE service offering. In addition, we are exploring other opportunities for the teaching technology in the marketplace.

A key aspect of the first SOLVE service element is the fact that eDoorways brings additional resources to bear in solving the consumer’s problem. One important resource is that of training and education on relevant lifestyle topics and issues, which is supported by our “intelligent” instructional technology. We have developed a highly advanced and internationally accredited teaching technology known as the “intelligent” instructional technology.

Our advanced software is an intuitive learning technology that creates a customized user profile by assessing the knowledge and skill level, and the strengths and weaknesses of the user through a sophisticated, yet easy to use Q&A format. As the user interacts with the learning environment, his/her profile and progress are benchmarked against an already stored “expert profile” of the demonstrated knowledge and skill that an expert in the field would have. Using the “expert profile” as a comparison, the program gauges the users progress and modifies the level of support accordingly, giving the less skilled user prompts and menus that are not provided to the more experienced user.

The Other “Doorways” of the eDOORWAYS Brand

We also intend to create six additional “doorways” to our platform and service offering. Each doorway will be given a unique name, such as the initial SOLVE doorway, and will be established in the marketplace as a distinct sub-brand. Although these doorways have yet to be named, each is unique in their service offerings, as follows:


Doorway II | Enter a world of enhanced personal participation where there are no hindrances due to your lack of knowledge. Obtain a more rich and thorough experience of any lifestyle activity with the help of an environment that brings you all relevant aspects of the lifestyle. If you like to tinker and explore, this doorway will be for you.
-----------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Doorway III | This doorway will offer an opportunity for anyone wishing to create a training experience for others or to further their own education to achieve their objective. It will offer a feature new to learning - the ability to tap into the skill and knowledge of others in a real-time venue to create a learning experience.
------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Doorway IV | This doorway brings technology, tolerance, and talent together to create new ideas, products, and possibilities. Imagine being able to go to a special place where you can air your creative thinking, run it by others of a similar mind, and turn it into a tangible, productive project using the unlimited human and information resources of the web.
-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Doorway V | This doorway connects those who want to help with those who need it. This extraordinary doorway will give those who wish to serve others the opportunity to bring tremendous focus and impact to their charitable action. You will be able to make your action known to those who care so that they may assist you in bringing your unique capabilities to a world in need.
----------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Doorway VI | With this doorway, consumers will be able to bring and apply focus to their mind. It will offer tools and a supportive environment for self-help and analysis. If you are interested in enhancing your personal ability, this doorway will bring you the resources you need to move forward.
-----------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Doorway VII | The Cardinal Doorway that leads to and orchestrates all others. It is the source of the technology and horsepower that drives the other six doorways. Doorway VII is the all-seeing, all-knowing personal assistant. No matter which doorway you’re in, Doorway VII will be standing at your side as your personal guide, assistant and mentor. It can tell you the questions you should be asking to accomplish your goal. And it is the ultimate provider of resources. Doorway VII will be the constant observer of both your actions and those of the world, reaching out to the world at the proper moment to bring you the exact knowledge and resources you need. Doorway VII will be constantly observing and learning, thereby enhancing the nature of the services it can offer.
------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


We anticipate, although no assurance can be given, that we will complete the branding plan on or before the end of December,2009. Until such time, we will not be able to make a final determination of the technologies we will require to offer the services contemplated above.

COMPETITION

eDOORWAYS will be an open website with typical HTML interactivity that people can access through internet searches as well as from a variety of partner/client websites. eDOORWAYS’ first doorway, SOLVE, will compete either directly or indirectly with the following web-based entities: GenieTown, LooBoo, The Local Guru, Local, Yub, Slide, Facebook, LinkedIn, Yahoo Answers, MySpace, and Fatdoor. However, we believe that these competitors do not have a collaboratively-based contextual (real time) service offering of the type contemplated by our business plan.

Below is a brief description of each of the businesses that we believe may be deemed to compete, either directly or indirectly, with our business.

Competitor | Description 
---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GenieTown | The company helps consumers hire quality service providers. Services are offered in nearly every category. On GenieTown, anyone can be a Genie and everyone can find the right Genie for the job. GenieTown leverages the power of the Web and matches consumers with local service providers in a safe, efficient, and trusted manner. 
LooBoo | LooBoo provides an extensive search database that is intended to provide its users with the ability to find businesses within a particular location.

Local | Local.com is a leader in local search with the Local.com search engine and related products that deliver relevant search results. With more than 20 patents held or pending for search engine technologies, Local.com designed its local search engine to help users quickly and easily find the most relevant results for local businesses, products, and services. In addition to the local search engine, Local.com offers products and services that help advertisers, business partners and local businesses optimize results for local search queries, effectively matching end user searches with advertisers in ways that are beneficial to both sets of Local.com customers. 
Yub | Yub is an online mall where people meet, hang together, and get up to 25% back for shopping. The number of products listed in Yub’s mall is 5,921,625. Like a real mall, you can hang out with friends, meet others, and people watch. Unlike a real mall, Yub personalizes your shopping and pays you for it. 
Slide | Slide is the largest personal media network in the world, reaching more than 134 million unique global viewers each month and 30 percent of the U.S. Internet audience. Slide helps people express themselves and tell stories through personalized photos and videos created on Slide.com and viewed anywhere on the web or desktop. Slide widgets — including Slideshows, Guestbooks, SkinFlix and FunPix — are popular on top social networking and blog platforms, including MySpace, Facebook, Bebo, Hi5, Friendster, Tagged, Piczo and Blogger. Slide is also the leading application developer on Facebook with more than 63 million applications installed, including SuperPoke and Top Friends, the most active application by more than four times that of any other 3rd party developer.
Facebook | Facebook is a social utility that connects people with friends and others who work, study and live around them. People use Facebook to keep up with friends, upload an unlimited number of photos, share links and videos, and learn more about the people they meet. Facebook is made up of many networks, each based around a company, region, or school. You can join the networks that reflect your real-life communities to learn more about the people who work, live, or study around you. 
LinkedIn | LinkedIn’s mission is to help people be more effective in their daily work and open doors to opportunities using the professional relationships they already have. A LinkedIn network consists of a person’s connections, their connections’ connections, and the people they know, linking them to thousands of qualified professionals. 


8


Yahoo! Answers | With Yahoo! Answers, one can get real answers from real people. A user can ask questions easily, answer others’ questions, and see what others are asking. 
---------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MySpace | MySpace permits: 
 | | ∙ | Friends who want to talk Online 
 | | ∙ | Single people who want to meet other Singles 
 | | ∙ | Matchmakers who want to connect their friends with other friends
 | | ∙ | Families who want to keep in touch--map your Family Tree 
 | | ∙ | Business people and co-workers interested in networking 
 | | ∙ | Classmates and study partners

Fatdoor | Fatdoor aims to connect users with their neighbors by providing a localized social network for their physical community. The website integrates with Microsoft Virtual Earth to display local business and residential listings on an interactive map. Once users claim their listings, they can add profiles and put down their interests. Users can then plan events and form local interest groups with the site.


Based on SOLVE’s design, we believe that none of the primary competitors we have identified above can or has attempted to offer an intensive problem solving service of the nature that we’ve developed. Moreover, although websites such as Google and Ask.com offer their search capabilities as a problem solving tool, the searches that can be performed on such websites do not approximate the kind of collaborative problem solving service we are contemplating and as such, these sites are not deemed by us to be competitors of the Company. The eDoorways search function is combined with context-relevant information and other useful functions such as placing consumers in contact with retailers and manufacturers in real-time. This will enable consistent and continuous product/service status reports along with all other availabile information, guidance and support. It will also provide valuable context-relevant “community chat” solutions offered by other consumers familiar with the problem faced by the searching consumer.

Moreover, SOLVE will also provide a dedicated e-commerce marketplace with an extensive collaborative component. While companies like Craigslist and eBay compete in the buy-sell arena, neither offer a service that would allow retailers and manufacturers to collaborate with the consumer on a real-time basis.

The combination of the services and components of the SOLVE doorway, along with other proprietary functions of the platform yield an Interactive Intelligent search system that lies at the heart of our Web 3.0 consumer model.

Our “SOLVE” branding strategy is based in a large part on our perception that the Internet services market is moving toward a new phase. We foresee a major push in the direction of aggregating both static and contextual information of potential interest to consumers and rendering that information to consumers in a form that is easier to understand and relate to. It can be safely assumed that the larger, more dominant players in the market will take the lead in this effort. Our plan is to move quickly and effectively in an attempt to assume a dominant role in the niche before the larger players are able to act.

In view of the above, eDOORWAYS’ competitive advantage for SOLVE and its value-add may be summarized as follows:

- End-user benefits of SOLVE: On the same web page, we will provide our users the solution to a problem, validated by millions of experts, as well as the enabler who can provide the “tools” needed to arrive at that solution, whether that is actual products or services.

- Partner Benefits: Our partners will have the opportunity to attract new customers, get closer to existing customers, learn about real-life business trends earlier and more efficiently than they do today, and grow sales while leveraging their existing infrastructure (i.e., they are already invested in web selling.)

DEPENDENCE ON ONE OR A FEW MAJOR CUSTOMERS

We presently do not have any customers for our services as we are still a development stage company.

PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, LICENSES, FRANCHISES, CONCESSIONS, ROYALTY AGREEMENTS OR LABOR CONTRACTS, INCLUDING DURATION:

In 2009, the Company filed applications for three Service Marks for the names “iDoorways”, “Consumer 3.0” and “eDOORWAYS”. As of December 31, 2009, these applications were still pending.

NEED FOR ANY GOVERNMENT APPROVAL OF PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS OR SERVICES

Not applicable.

EFFECTS OF EXISTING OR PROBABLE GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS ON OUR BUSINESS

As Internet commerce continues to evolve, increasing regulation by federal, state or foreign agencies may become more likely and our business may be subject to increase regulation in the area of data privacy, and laws and regulations applying to the solicitation, collection, processing or use of personal or consumer information. Any such laws could result in a decline in the use of the Internet and the viability of Internet-based products and services, which could harm our business and operating results.
COSTS AND EFFECTS OF COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS

We do not expect any environmental laws to give rise to additional costs to our business.

EMPLOYEES

As of the reporting date and thereafter, we had one (1) employee. During 2009, to lower operating costs, we relied on consultants rather than employment contracts.
