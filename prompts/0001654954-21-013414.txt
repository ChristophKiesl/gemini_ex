ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
BACKGROUND AND CAPITAL STRUCTURE

Know Labs, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada in 1998. Since 2007, the Company has been focused primarily on research and development of proprietary spectroscopic technologies spanning the electromagnetic spectrum. More recently, the Company has used its proprietary Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) Deep Learning Platform to further enhance the ability of its spectroscopic technologies to accurately identify and measure a wide range of organic and inorganic materials, analytes and compositions of matter. The AI platform has recently produced revenues through the sale of Non-Fungible Tokens (“NFT”) it generated. Our Common Stock trades on the OTCQB Exchange under the symbol “KNWN.” 
BUSINESS

We are focused on the development and commercialization of proprietary biosensor technologies which, when paired with our AI deep learning platform, are capable of uniquely identifying and measuring almost any material or analyte using electromagnetic energy to detect, record, identify and measure the unique “signature” of said materials or analytes. We call these our “Bio-RFID™” technology platform when pertaining to radio and microwave spectroscopy; and “ChromaID” technology platform when pertaining to optical spectroscopy. The data obtained with our biosensor technology is analyzed with our trade secret algorithms which are driven by our AI Deep Learning platform.

ChromaID is the first technology developed and patented by the Company. For the past several years, we have focused upon extensions and new patentable inventions that are derived from and extend beyond our ChromaID technology and intellectual property. We call this technology platform Bio-RFID. The rapid advances made with our Bio-RFID technology in our laboratory have caused us to move quickly into the commercialization phase of our Company as we work to create revenue generating products for the marketplace. Today, the primary focus of the Company is on its Bio-RFID technology, its commercialization and development of related patent assets. Through its wholly owned subsidiary corporations the Company works to exploit additional opportunities and markets that its broad intellectual property and trade secret portfolio addresses.

The Know Labs Technology

We have internally and under contract with third parties developed proprietary platform technologies to uniquely identify and measure almost any organic and inorganic material or analyte. Our patented technology utilizes electromagnetic energy along a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum from visible light and infrared to radio and microwave wavelengths to perform analytics which allow the user to accurately identify and measure materials and analytes depending upon the specified targets or endpoints and field of use. The Company’s proprietary platform technologies are called Bio-RFID and ChromaID.

Our most recent technology platform is called Bio-RFID, which utilizes spectroscopy at higher wavelengths than ChromaID’s optical range, to span radio wave and microwave segments of the electromagnetic spectrum. Working in our lab over the last three years, we have developed extensions and new inventions derived in part from our ChromaID technology which we refer to as Bio-RFID. We believe an important competitive differentiator for Bio-RFID to be its ability to not only identify a wide range of organic and inorganic materials and analytes, but to do so concurrently, and in real time, which potentially enables new multivariate models of clinical diagnostics, and health and wellness monitoring. We are rapidly advancing the development of this technology by increasing its accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. We have announced detailed results confirming that we have successfully been able to non-invasively measure blood glucose levels in humans.

The ability of the Company to obtain exacting results from the data obtained from its Bio-RFID sensor technology, also referred to as Radio Frequency Spectroscopy or RF Spectroscopy is a consequence of the application of the Company’s trade secret algorithms. The Company has worked for the last several years on the AI and Machine Learning (“ML”) that drives the accurate pattern recognition of its algorithms. This work has led to the development of a robust AI Deep Learning Platform. This AI Platform drives the data pattern recognition for Bio-RFID’s exacting determination of blood glucose levels. It can also provide the data recognition for blood alcohol and blood oxygen levels which the Company also identified in preliminary tests. It will provide the analytics for the long list of other analytes in the human body that the Company will pursue non-invasive detection of, many of which are set forth in the Company’s issued patent USPTO 11,033,208 B1. The Company’s AI Deep Learning Platform will be monetized through the subsidiary AI Mind, Inc. AI Mind, Inc. was incorporated on September 17, 2021 and had limited operations through September 30, 2021 but expects to begin more substantive operations next quarter.

We continue to build the internal and external development team necessary to commercialize this newly discovered technology as well as make additional patent filings covering the intellectual property created with these new inventions. The first applications of our Bio-RFID technology will be in a product marketed as a Glucose Monitor. It will provide the user with real time information on their blood glucose levels. This product will require US Food and Drug Administration clearance prior to its introduction to the market, which we plan to pursue. 

We have also announced the results of laboratory-based comparison testing between our Bio-RFID technology and the leading continuous glucose monitors from Abbott Labs (Freestyle Libre®) and DexCom (G6®). These results provide evidence of a high degree of correlation between our Bio-RFID technology and the current industry leaders and their continuous glucose monitors. Our patented technology is fundamentally differentiated from these industry leaders as our technology completely non-invasively monitors blood glucose levels.

In addition to internal testing, the Company engaged a world-renowned research institution to perform third party validation testing of the Bio-RFID technology. The purpose of the independent pre-clinical research was to confirm that Know Labs’ Bio-RFID technology is able to precisely and non-invasively measure and identify a variety of analytes in vitro by detecting their unique radio frequency spectral responses. The results of this testing were reported in a June 8, 2021, press release and Form 8-K filing. Unfortunately, the research institution would not allow their name to be used in the press release absent the publication of the report in a peer reviewed journal, which can take considerable time. 

We have begun the internal process to pursue US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of our non-invasive blood glucose monitoring device as soon as possible. To guide us in that undertaking we previously announced the hiring of a Chief Medical Officer and formed a Medical and Regulatory Advisory Board to guide us through the FDA process. Additionally, we have retained third party quality assurance and documentation consultants to ensure that the rigorous requirements of the FDA are met. We are unable, however, to estimate the time necessary for such approval nor the likelihood of success in that endeavor.

Our ChromaID patented technology utilizes light at the photon (elementary particle of light) level through a series of emitters and detectors to generate a unique signature or “fingerprint” from a scan of almost any solid, liquid or gaseous material. This signature of reflected or transmitted light is digitized, creating a unique ChromaID signature. Each ChromaID signature is comprised of from hundreds to thousands of specific data points. 

The ChromaID technology looks beyond visible light frequencies to areas of near infra-red and ultraviolet light and beyond that are outside the humanly visible light spectrum. The data obtained allows us to create a very specific and unique ChromaID signature of the substance for a myriad of authentication, verification, and identification applications. 

Bio-RFID, ChromaID and AI Deep Learning: Foundational Platform Technologies

Our technologies provide a unique platform upon which a myriad of applications can be developed. As platform technologies, they are analogous to a smartphone, upon which an enormous number of previously unforeseen applications have been developed. Bio-RFID and ChromaID technologies are “enabling” technologies that bring the science of electromagnetic energy to low-cost, real-world commercialization opportunities across multiple industries. The technologies are foundational and, as such, the basis upon which the Company believes significant businesses can be built. While the Company is pursuing its core focus on commercializing its Glucose Monitor, it believes non-core clinical and non-clinical applications represent a myriad of opportunity for strategic collaboration and joint development agreements with leading companies in their respective industries.

As with other foundational technologies, a single application may reach across multiple industries. The Bio-RFID technology can non-invasively identify the presence and quantity of blood glucose in the human body. By extension, there may be other analytes or molecular structures this same technology can identify in the human body which, over time, the Company will focus on. They may include the monitoring of drug usage or the presence of illicit drugs. They may also involve identifying hormones and various biomarkers of disease or pre-conditions of disease.

Similarly, the ChromaID technology can, for example effectively differentiate and identify different brands of clear vodkas that appear identical to the human eye. By extension, this same technology could identify pure water from water with contaminants present. It could provide real time detection of liquid medicines such as morphine that have been adulterated or compromised. It could detect if jet fuel has water contamination present. It could determine when it is time to change oil in a deep fat fryer. These are but a few of the potential applications of the ChromaID technology based upon extensions of its ability to identify different liquids.

The AI Deep Learning Platform is an enabling technology which can identify patterns from data gathered from both the Bio-RFID and ChromaID platform technologies. The AI Deep Learning Platform is critical to the Company’s ability to identify accurately blood glucose levels and other analytes in the human body. Over time, utilizing our AI Deep Learning Platform we plan to develop analytics which, when using data collected from our sensors, will provide useful information on health and wellness to end users, and potentially lead to what the Company calls “Predictive Health.” In addition to identifying patterns, the inverse is also possible as the Company’s AI Deep Learning Platform can also create patterns in the form of 3D graphical images. That activity has found its first form in the work of the Company’s subsidiary, AI Mind, Inc., to generate beautiful 3D graphical images which were sold as NFTs providing revenue in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, as reported in the Company’s recently filed Form 8-K and press release. The Company believes there will be future revenue generation from the sale of NFTs and from other applications of its AI Deep Learning Platform.

The cornerstone of a company with a foundational platform technology is its intellectual property portfolio. We have pursued an active intellectual property strategy which includes focus on patents where appropriate and a diligent protection of trade secrets. The Company has been granted 20 patents and 6 design patents. We currently have a number of patents pending and continue, on a regular basis, the filing of new patents. We possess all right, title and interest to the issued patents.
