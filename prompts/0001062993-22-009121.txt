A cash prize is awarded to the player who receives the most points for correctly bidding on the final scores of the sports events included in the Challenge. The system for bidding on the final scores is unique in the gaming industry.
 Business Model. The business model entails offering free prizes for playing the game, developing a large contingent of users and delivering advertisements.
