ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Tribal Rides International Corp., a Nevada corporation (the “Company”), was incorporated on May 19, 2014 as “Trimax Consulting, Inc.” On May 8, 2017, the Company changed its name to “Xinda International Corp.”
 
From incorporation through January 2020, the Company was principally engaged in the business of marketing an array of property tax lien services including (a) identifying property tax lien auctions and property tax liens for sale; (b) providing valuation services with regards to real property subject to property tax liens; and (c) providing consultative and advisory services to property tax lien investors in regards to purchasing property tax liens, servicing property tax liens and adjudicating property tax liens.
On January 18, 2020, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Tribal Rides, Inc., a Nevada corporation (“Tribal Rides”), pursuant to which the Company purchased certain assets of Tribal Rides in exchange for the issuance of 25,000,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock. On February 24, 2021, the Company changed its name to “Tribal Rides International Corp.”
 
After the asset purchase, we are now engaged in a business that is in the research and development stage of disrupting current ride-sharing paradigms. We are a transportation technology company creating the future of personal mobility with a unique, patented focus on autonomous vehicles. We believe that the mobility ecosystem and marketplace we are creating, based upon our innovative patent and patent-pending technologies, will enable us to address current ridesharing demands and those of the rapidly emerging autonomous vehicle personal mobility market. We are focused on having a significant impact in the emerging self-driving car marketplace estimated at $3 trillion by 20301.
 
Our Principal Products or Services and Markets
 
We are developing a cloud-based Systems as a Solution (“SaaS”) interface for a comprehensive social network and mobile app. Our planned E-commerce module will enable users to create and manage their own highly personalized transportation experience; to form and/or join groups; collaborate on cost-saving strategies; find, schedule, obtain transportation services from within the groups in which they belong, and easily and securely conduct financial transactions.
 
We believe that the approximately fourteen million shared-ride drivers in the United States are possible customers for our SaaS services and software and they too may be able to move forward with the autonomous vehicles and their expanded scope of services.

Environmental, Social and Governance
 
The world’s cities are expanding with a resulting suburban daily automobile commute that is un-scalable and over-crowding infrastructure. The average commuter spends nearly as much annually on vehicles, their maintenance and fuel as they do on housing. We believe that this is proving to be unsustainable both fiscally and environmentally.
 
While electric vehicles reduce some of the environmental burden, they do not improve our clogged roadways nor greatly reduce the cost burden of vehicle ownership. We believe the emergence of self-driving cars enhanced by our Unified Transportation Ecosystem and Marketplace will bring another wave of societal and environmental transformation, making carpooling safer, optimized and convenient resulting in fewer vehicles on the road, and a corresponding reduction in congestion and damaging emissions. We also believe that creating, developing and rewarding a cooperative community of users, developers and vendors through ownership stock grants will inspire loyalty to our platform, create a priority of use and commitment, and will provide for financial advancement while reducing the costs of vehicle use and ownership.
 
Distribution
 
We are developing a cloud-based Systems as a Solution (“SaaS”) interface for a comprehensive social network and mobile app. We plan to distribute our mobile app. through Android and Apple in the future.
 
Marketing
 
Although in its infancy, our marketing plan is to reach out through various social media outlets and to communicate directly with drivers and riders who will be interested our new and innovative features and functions for shared rides.
Status of Our Publicly Announced Products or Services
 
Our SaaS interface is still in the development stage.
 
Competition
 
We believe that our disruptive technology and ecosystem will compete with the current shared-ride provider community, specifically Uber and Lyft.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We have patent and patent pending technologies with a focus on artificial intelligence (“AI”), machine learning with optimization and Smart Deployment algorithms. It involves anticipating demand for passengers and dispatching cars in advance – to reduce wait-time, increasing utilization of vehicles, and decrease cost. It includes new and efficient system for tracking and charging customers with preferred rates, supply and demand rates, and “specific” community engagement.
 
We currently own the following patents which have been issued and which are pending:
 

· | U.S. Patent 9,984,574, issued May 29, 2018, claims priority to provisional application filed on Jan. 21, 2014 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Pending U.S. application, published as US 2018/0366004 A1, claims priority to provisional application filed on Jan. 21, 2014
· | Pending U.S. application, unpublished, claims priority to three provisional applications filed on Nov. 4, 2019.
