Item 1. Business
 Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the identification, acquisition, development, and commercialization of novel products for the treatment of serious rare and ultra-rare genetic diseases. We target diseases for which the unmet medical need is high, the biology for treatment is clear, and for which there are no currently approved therapies. Since our inception in 2010, we have in-licensed potential treatments for multiple rare genetic disorders. Our strategy, which is predicated upon time- and cost-efficient drug development, allows us to pursue multiple programs in parallel with the goal of delivering safe and effective therapies to patients with the utmost urgency. 
 Our current product candidate pipeline has been either in-licensed from academic institutions or derived from partnerships with other pharmaceutical companies. Our strategy is to acquire and retain global commercialization rights to our products to maximize long-term value, where possible. We have started building our own commercial organization, which we believe will be highly targeted due to the relatively small number of specialists who treat patients with rare and ultra-rare diseases. At this time, however, we have no products that are approved for sale.
 The patients we seek to treat have diseases with limited or no treatment options, and we recognize that their lives and well-being are dependent upon our efforts to develop new therapies. For this reason, we are passionate about developing these therapies with the utmost urgency and care. 
 We were founded in April 2010 by our current President and Chief Executive Officer, Emil Kakkis, M.D., Ph.D. We have assembled an experienced team with extensive rare disease drug development and commercialization capabilities. Dr. Kakkis and the team at Ultragenyx have been previously involved at other companies in the development and/or commercialization of many therapies approved or in development for rare genetic diseases. 
 Our Strategy 
 Our strategy is to identify, acquire, develop, and commercialize novel products for the treatment of rare and ultra-rare diseases in the United States, the European Union, or EU, and select international markets, with the goal of becoming a leading rare disease biotechnology company. The critical components of our business strategy include the following: 

• | Focus on rare and ultra-rare diseases with significant unmet medical need and clear biology. There are numerous rare and ultra-rare genetic diseases that currently have no approved drug therapy and for which no therapies are currently in development. Patients suffering from these diseases often have a high unmet medical need with significant morbidity and/or mortality. We are focused on developing and commercializing therapies for multiple such indications with the utmost urgency. We also focus on diseases that have biology that is well understood. For example, several of our product candidates are replacement therapies for a single deficient enzyme or substrate in the body. We believe that developing drugs that directly impact known disease pathways will increase the probability of success of our development programs.

• | Leverage our experience and relationships to in-license promising product candidates. Our management team seeks to develop and maintain strong relationships with key opinion leaders in the genetic field and leverage our success in the development and commercialization of therapies for rare and ultra-rare genetic diseases. All of our current clinical product candidates are in-licensed from academic institutions or derived from partnerships with other pharmaceutical companies. We believe parties agree to license product candidates to us because they are confident in our team’s drug development capabilities and our plans and execution thus far in bringing rare disease therapies to market. Because we typically in-license product candidates that require translational or clinical research, at this time we do not intend to invest significant capital in basic research, which can be expensive and time-consuming.

• | Focus on excellent, rapid, and efficient clinical and regulatory execution on multiple programs in parallel. We believe that building a successful and sustainable rare disease-focused company requires very specific expertise in the areas of patient identification, clinical study design and conduct, and regulatory strategy. We have assembled a team capable of managing global clinical development activities in an efficient manner and with multinational experience in obtaining regulatory approvals for rare disease products. Clinical development programs for rare and ultra-rare diseases can often be smaller in size than those for larger market indications. Development of multiple programs in rare diseases also generates organizational efficiencies and economies of scale. We also seek to manage our fixed cost structure by outsourcing manufacturing of our product candidates. As a result of these efficiencies, we are able to feasibly develop multiple clinical-stage product candidates in parallel, resulting in a more diversified portfolio that provides multiple opportunities to create value.

• | Seek to retain global commercialization rights to product candidates. We intend to seek and retain global commercialization rights to our product candidates whenever possible to maximize the potential value of our product portfolio. We have started to establish our own commercial organization in major pharmaceutical markets and develop a network of third-party distributors in smaller markets. We believe this commercial organization can be highly targeted due to the relatively small number of specialists who typically treat patients with the diseases to be addressed by our product candidates. As a result, we do not expect that we will require pharmaceutical partners for commercialization of our product candidates in major markets, although we may consider partnering for certain territories or indications or for other strategic purposes.

Clinical Product Candidates 
 Our current clinical-stage pipeline consists of two product categories: biologics (including a monoclonal antibody and an enzyme replacement therapy); and small-molecule substrate replacement therapies. Enzymes are proteins that the body uses to process materials needed for normal cellular function, and substrates are the materials upon which enzymes act. When enzymes or substrates are missing, the body is unable to perform its normal cellular functions, often leading to significant clinical disease. Several of our therapies are intended to replace deficient enzymes or substrates. 
 The following table summarizes our current clinical-stage product candidate pipeline:

KRN23 (UX023) for the treatment of XLH 
 KRN23 is a fully human monoclonal antibody administered via subcutaneous injection that is designed to bind and reduce the biological activity of FGF23 to increase abnormally low phosphate levels in patients with XLH. Patients with XLH have low serum phosphate levels due to excessive phosphate loss into the urine, which is directly caused by the effect on kidney function of excess FGF23 production in bone cells. Low phosphate levels lead to poor bone mineralization and a variety of clinical manifestations, including rickets leading to bowing and other skeletal deformities, short stature, bone pain and fractures, and muscle weakness. There is no approved drug therapy or treatment for the underlying cause of XLH. Most patients are managed using frequently dosed oral phosphate replacement and vitamin D therapy, which can lead to significant side effects. Oral phosphate/vitamin D replacement therapy requires extremely close monitoring due to the potential for excessive phosphate levels and secondary increases in calcium, which can result in severe damage to the kidneys from excess calcium phosphate deposits and other complications. Additionally, some patients are unable to tolerate the regimen due to the chalky stool that results from taking large amounts of oral phosphate or the high frequency of dosing required. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, has granted Fast Track Designation to the KRN23 program for the treatment of XLH, and Breakthrough Therapy Designation for pediatric patients one year of age or older.
 In July 2014, we announced the first patient screened and enrolled in the Phase 2 pediatric study of KRN23 in patients ages 5 to 12 years with XLH. The main part of the study consists of a 16-week individual dose-titration period followed by a 48-week treatment period, followed by an extension period. Patients were divided into three cohorts of escalating starting dose levels of KRN23, and were dosed either once every four weeks or biweekly. At the end of the 16-week dose-titration period, patients were allowed to continue to receive dose increases in order to reach the individually optimized dose of KRN23 on a biweekly or every four-week basis for the 48-week treatment period. The primary objectives of the study are to identify a dose and dosing regimen and to establish the safety profile of treatment with KRN23 in pediatric XLH patients. We are also assessing preliminary clinical effects of KRN23 treatment on bone health and deformity as measured by radiographic assessments, growth, muscle strength, and motor function, as well as markers of bone health and patient-reported outcomes of pain, disability, and quality of life.
 In September 2016, we released interim data through 40 weeks for all 52 patients in the study, and 64-week data for the first 36 patients in the study. Forty-nine of the 52 patients had previously been on standard of care (oral phosphate/active vitamin D therapy) for an average of 6.7 years. Patient demographics were well balanced between the biweekly (n=26) and every four-week (n=26) dose groups. Rickets were evaluated via two scoring systems – the RSS and the Radiographic Global Impression of Change (RGI-C). A subset of patients (n=34; 17 dosed biweekly and 17 dosed every four weeks) were pre-specified as having higher rickets severity (greater bone disease) if their baseline total RSS scores were > 1.5. 
 Overall, in all patients (n=52), the mean total RSS score decreased by 50% from baseline to 40 weeks (p<0.0001). In patients with higher baseline rickets (n=34), the mean total rickets score decreased by 61% from baseline to 40 weeks (p<0.0001). In patients who were dosed bi-weekly (n=26), the mean total RSS score decreased by 61% from baseline to 40 weeks (p<0.0001). In the higher severity patients who were dosed bi-weekly (n=17), the mean total rickets score decreased by 71% from baseline to 40 weeks (p<0.0001). 
 Overall, patients (n=52) experienced a mean improvement in RGI-C score of +1.56 (p<0.0001), and those patients with higher baseline rickets (n=34) experienced a mean improvement of +1.91 (p<0.0001) from baseline to 40 weeks. Patients who were dosed bi-weekly (n=26) experienced a mean improvement in RGI-C score of +1.72 (p<0.0001), and those patients with higher baseline rickets (n=17) experienced a mean improvement of +2.04 (p<0.0001) from baseline to 40 weeks. 
 Overall, patients (n=52) experienced a mean improvement in growth velocity of +0.68 (p=0.0321) and a mean improvement in height z-score of 0.13 (p<0.0001) from baseline to 40 weeks. Those patients with higher baseline rickets (n=34) experienced a mean improvement in growth velocity of +1.23 (p=0.0046) and a mean improvement in height z-score of 0.18 (p=0.0003) from baseline to 40 weeks. Patients who were dosed bi-weekly (n=26) experienced a mean improvement in growth velocity of +0.96 (p=0.0088) and a mean improvement in height z-score of 0.17 (p<0.0001) from baseline to 40 weeks. Those patients with higher baseline rickets who were dosed bi-weekly (n=17) experienced a mean improvement of +1.69 (p<0.0001) in growth velocity and a mean improvement in height z-score of 0.22 (p<0.0001) from baseline to 40 weeks. 
 Patients with walking impairment at baseline (defined by < 80% predicted normal walk distance in the six minute walk test, or 6MWT) in the bi-weekly dosing group achieved a mean increase of 84 meters (p<0.001) at 40 weeks (n=14), and 97 meters (p<0.001) at 64 weeks (n=7). Functional disability scores were measured with the Pediatric Orthopedic Society North America/Pediatric Outcome Data Collection Instrument (POSNA/PODCI). When evaluating the Global score of all five domains in those patients with substantial impairment at baseline (n=28, defined as baseline scores < 40 or one standard deviation below the normalized score of 50), a mean improvement of +17.5 (p< 0.0001) was observed at 40 weeks. Though the magnitude of these changes in functional measurements are substantial, any conclusions must be tempered by the fact that these data are from an uncontrolled, open-label study.

The most common treatment-related adverse events (AEs) reported by preferred term was injection site reaction in 33% of patients. All of these reactions were considered mild. All other treatment-related adverse events were also considered mild. There was one serious adverse event considered possibly treatment-related. This was a previously reported patient with fever and muscle pain who improved without complication and is still in the trial. There have been no deaths or discontinuations from the study for any reason. No clinically meaningful changes were observed in mean serum calcium, urinary calcium and in serum intact parathyroid hormone. None of the patients had serum phosphorus levels above the upper limit of normal at any time point. No clinically significant changes were observed in renal ultrasounds pre- and post-treatment.
In October 2016, we initiated a Phase 3 randomized open-label clinical study comparing the efficacy and safety of KRN23 to oral phosphate and active vitamin D therapy in approximately 60 pediatric patients with XLH. The study will evaluate changes in rickets, growth velocity and height, pharmacodynamic assessments, walking ability, patient reported outcomes assessing pain, fatigue and physical function, and safety.   
 We are also continuing to develop KRN23 in adults with XLH. In September 2016, we announced interim 24-week results (n=20) from the open-label Phase 2b extension study of KRN23 in adult XLH patients who had previously participated in the studies conducted by Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd., or KHK. Patients demonstrated significant improvements in serum phosphorus levels and pain, stiffness and physical function domain scores at 24 weeks of treatment. The safety profile observed to date in the study is consistent with other XLH studies. In July 2016, we completed enrollment of 134 patients in a Phase 3 study of KRN23 for the treatment of adults with XLH. The Phase 3 study is an international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study assessing the efficacy and safety of monthly KRN23 in adult XLH patients. The primary endpoint of the study is serum phosphorus levels through 24 weeks, and the key secondary endpoints are pain as measured by the Brief Pain Inventory Question 3 (pain at its worst in the last 24 hours), stiffness as measured by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC®), and physical function as measured by WOMAC®. We expect data from this study in the first half of 2017. A 48-week open-label bone quality study in approximately 14 adult XLH patients evaluating the potential impact of KRN23 on the underlying osteomalacia via bone biopsy is also ongoing.
 In January 2017, we and our partner Kyowa Kirin International PLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of KHK, announced that we filed a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, for the conditional marketing authorization of KRN23 for the treatment of XLH based on the Phase 2 data, and that the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, validated the application. An opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, is expected in the second half of 2017.We plan to submit a biologics license application, or BLA, to the FDA for KRN23 in the second half of 2017. Based on discussions with the FDA, our understanding is that the pediatric Phase 3 study is currently not expected to be required for a U.S. filing. We continue to discuss the details of the planned submission with the FDA. 
 Please see “—License and Collaboration Agreements—Kyowa Hakko Kirin” for a description of our collaboration and license agreement with KHK.
 KRN23 (UX023) for the treatment of TIO 
 We are also developing KRN23 for the treatment of TIO. TIO results from typically benign tumors that produce excess levels of FGF23, which can lead to severe hypophosphatemia, osteomalacia, bone fractures, fatigue, bone and muscle pain, and muscle weakness. There are cases in which resection of the tumor is not feasible or recurrence of the tumor occurs after resection. In patients for whom the tumor is inoperable, the current standard of care consists of oral phosphate and/or vitamin D replacement. The efficacy of this treatment is often limited, as it does not treat the underlying disease and its benefits must be balanced with monitoring for potential risks such as nephrocalcinosis, hypercalciuria, and hyperparathyroidism. 
 In 2015, we initiated a Phase 2 study evaluating KRN23 safety and efficacy in 17 adult inoperable patients. The primary objectives of the study are to establish the dose and assess the safety profile of treatment with KRN23 in adults with TIO. Patients receive subcutaneous injections of KRN23 once every four weeks for 48 weeks. All patients begin treatment with KRN23 at a starting dose of 0.3 mg/kg. Doses are then titrated in an effort to achieve a target fasting serum phosphorus range of 2.5 to 4.0 mg/dL. After completing the initial 48-week treatment period of the study, patients may continue into a planned treatment extension period in which they would receive KRN23 treatment for up to an additional 96 weeks. The co-primary endpoints include: the proportion of patients achieving mean peak serum phosphorus levels above the lower limit of normal (LLN; 2.5 mg/dL), as averaged between baseline and week 24; and the percent change from baseline in excess osteoid after 48 weeks of treatment.

In September 2016, we released 24-week interim data from the first eight patients in this study. Mean serum phosphorus, renal phosphate reabsorption (TmP/GFR) and serum 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D levels increased over 24 weeks of treatment. The mean serum phosphorus level entered the normal range (above 2.5mg/dL lower limit of normal) within one week of treatment, and was maintained in the low normal range from week 10 to week 24 of treatment. Of the seven patients who responded, six patients showed an improvement in bone mineral density, and bone turnover markers showed a statistically significant increase. One patient completed 48 weeks of treatment, at which time bone biopsy indicated an improvement from severe osteomalacia at baseline to mild osteomalacia at 48 weeks. The same patient showed resolution of four fractures at 24 weeks of treatment, determined by bone scan as previously disclosed. Bone mineral density for this patient improved 2% and 3% in the lumber spine and total hip, respectively. Adverse events occurred in all patients. Treatment-related adverse events were observed in three patients (38%), and included Vitamin D deficiency and rash as previously disclosed, and dysgeusia, all mild in grade. There was one serious adverse event of neoplasm progression, which occurred in one patient with pre-existing metastatic spindle sarcoma who did not respond and has discontinued treatment. No injection site reactions were observed. Two patients reported restless leg syndrome, one of whom had symptoms suggestive of worsening pre-existing restless leg syndrome. No clinically meaningful changes were observed in mean serum calcium, urinary calcium and in serum intact parathyroid hormone. We expect additional data from this study in the second half of 2017. 
 rhGUS (UX003) for the treatment of MPS 7 
 rhGUS is an intravenous, or IV, enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of MPS 7, also known as Sly Syndrome. Patients with MPS 7 suffer from severe cellular and organ dysfunction that typically leads to death in the teens or early adulthood. MPS 7 is caused by a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme beta-glucuronidase, which is required for the breakdown of certain complex carbohydrates known as glycosaminoglycans, or GAGs. The inability to properly break down GAGs leads to their accumulation in many tissues, resulting in a serious multi-system disease. Patients with MPS 7 may have abnormal coarsened facial features, enlargement of the liver and spleen, airway obstruction, lung disease, cardiovascular complications, joint stiffness, short stature, and a skeletal disease known as dysostosis multiplex. In addition, many patients experience progressive lung problems as a result of airway obstruction and mucous production, often leading to sleep apnea and pulmonary insufficiency, and eventually requiring tracheostomy. There are currently no approved drug therapies for MPS 7. 
 We initiated a Phase 3 global, randomized, placebo-controlled, blind-start clinical study in December 2014. The Phase 3 study was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of rhGUS in 12 patients between five and 35 years of age. Patients were randomized to one of four groups. One cohort began rhGUS therapy immediately, while the other three started on placebo and crossed over to rhGUS at different predefined time points in a blinded manner. This study design generated treatment data from all 12 patients. Based on data from the Phase 1/2 study, patients were dosed with 4 mg/kg of rhGUS every other week for up to a total of 48 weeks, and all groups received a minimum of 24 weeks of treatment with rhGUS. The primary objective of the study was to determine the efficacy of rhGUS as determined by the percent reduction in urinary GAG excretion after 24 weeks of treatment. The Phase 3 study also evaluated as secondary endpoints the safety and tolerability of rhGUS, pulmonary function, walking, stair climb, shoulder flexion, fine and gross motor function, hepatosplenomegaly, cardiac size and function, visual acuity, patient and caregiver assessment of most significant clinical problems, global impressions of change, a multi-domain responder index, and other endpoints.
 In July 2016, we announced that the study met its primary endpoint of reducing urinary GAG (dermatan sulfate) excretion after 24 weeks of treatment, demonstrating a reduction from baseline of 64.8 percent (p<0.0001). The Multi-Domain Responder Index (MDRI) score at 24 weeks of treatment, a secondary endpoint, demonstrated an overall mean improvement (±SD) of +0.5 domains (±0.80) (p=0.0527). Six of the 12 patients had an improvement in their MDRI score of +1 or more. Five patients demonstrated no worsening of this progressive disease, or an MDRI score of 0. One patient had an MDRI score of -1. The MDRI is a summation of scores from each of the following domains: the six-minute walk test (6MWT), forced vital capacity (FVC), shoulder flexion, visual acuity, and the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency (BOT-2) fine motor and gross motor function. For the 6MWT, the improvement (±SE) was 20.8 (±16.75) meters at 24 weeks of treatment based on the estimates from nine patients who had any change from baseline data. Three of these patients demonstrated an improvement of a magnitude equal to or greater than the minimally important difference (MID) with increases of 65 meters, 80 meters and 83 meters at 24 weeks compared to baseline. For the fatigue scores, four patients improved at or above the MID level after 24 weeks of treatment and nine of 12 showed improvement at some point during the study. All patients experienced treatment emergent adverse events, which were generally mild to moderate in severity. Six of the eight patients with infusion associated reactions (IARs) on rhGUS treatment had events involving the IV catheter. Two patients experienced a single hypersensitivity-type IAR, including one Grade 3 treatment-related anaphylactoid serious adverse event (SAE) that resulted from an infusion rate error. The second patient had mild fever and diaphoresis that resolved without treatment. No patients demonstrated recurring hypersensitivity reactions to infusions. There was a second SAE that was a Grade 2 unrelated event from an accidental injury. There were no deaths and no treatment discontinuations or missed infusions due to AEs. Seven of the 12 patients developed anti-rhGUS antibodies, which were not associated with immune-mediated AEs.

Based on the data from the Phase 3 study, we have met with the FDA and the EMA and plan to submit regulatory filings in the first half of 2017. We also previously obtained feedback from the FDA and the EMA regarding the design of the Phase 3 study. The FDA stated that their evaluation of the pivotal Phase 3 study will be based on the totality of the data on a patient-by-patient basis and advised against the declaration of a primary endpoint. The EMA has agreed that approval under exceptional circumstances could be possible based upon a single positive placebo-controlled pivotal study in approximately 12 patients using urinary GAG levels as a surrogate primary endpoint, provided the data was strongly supportive of a favorable benefit/risk ratio and some evidence or trend in improvement in clinical endpoints was observed to support the primary endpoint. The EMA recognized that a statistically significant result on clinical endpoints was unlikely given the small number of patients expected to be enrolled in the study.
 In August 2015, we initiated a study of rhGUS in MPS 7 patients under the age of five years, including potentially younger infants born with hydrops fetalis. These hydropic infants can die within a few months to one year of birth, but enzyme replacement therapy might be able to reduce GAG storage and improve health in these patients. The Phase 2 open-label study will assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of rhGUS in up to seven pediatric patients under five years old. 
 We are also supplying rhGUS to investigators who are treating patients under emergency investigational new drug, or eIND, applications and other expanded access programs. Please see “—License and Collaboration Agreements—Saint Louis University” for a description of our license agreement with Saint Louis University.
 UX007 for the treatment of LC-FAOD 
 We are developing UX007 for oral administration intended as a substrate replacement therapy for patients with LC-FAOD. UX007 is a purified, pharmaceutical-grade form of triheptanoin, a specially designed synthetic triglyceride compound, created via a multi-step chemical process. Triheptanoin has been studied clinically for over a decade in more than a hundred human subjects affected by a variety of diseases. UX007 is a medium odd-chain triglyceride of seven-carbon fatty acids designed to provide substrate replacement for fatty acid metabolism and restore production of energy. Patients with LC-FAOD have a deficiency that impairs the ability to produce energy from fat, which can lead to depletion of glucose in the body, and severe liver, muscle, and heart disease, as well as death. There are currently no approved drugs or treatments specifically for LC-FAOD. The current standard of care for LC-FAOD includes diligent prevention of fasting combined with the use of low-fat/high-carbohydrate diets, carnitine supplementation in some cases, and medium even-chain triglyceride oil supplementation. Despite treatment with the current standard of care, many patients continue to suffer significant morbidity and mortality. 
 In November 2016, we reported positive 78-week data from the Phase 2 study in LC-FAOD patients. The study was single-arm open-label and evaluated 29 pediatric and adult patients across three main symptom groups (musculoskeletal, liver/hypoglycemia, and cardiac). Patients needed to have moderate to severe FAOD with significant disease in at least one of these domains or a frequent medical events history in order to enroll. The study began with a four-week run-in period to assess baseline data while on the standard of care therapy including MCT oil, if applicable. Patients on MCT oil then discontinued it and UX007 was titrated to a target dose of 25-35% of total daily caloric intake. Patients were followed to evaluate the acute effects of UX007 treatment over 24 weeks on several endpoints, including cycle ergometry performance, 12-minute walk test, liver disease/hypoglycemia, cardiac disease, and quality of life. Patients who opted to continue were treated for a total of 78 weeks, and rates of major medical events, such as rhabdomyolysis, hypoglycemia and cardiac events, were monitored and compared to rates for the two years prior to treatment with UX007. The study evaluated the safety and tolerability of UX007 and is being used to determine both the appropriate patient population as well as endpoints for evaluation in a Phase 3 study. The majority of patients enrolled presented with musculoskeletal disease compared to a limited number who presented with liver and cardiac symptoms. Patients spanned a wide age range from ten months to 58 years old. Prior to initiating treatment with UX007, 27 of the 29 patients were on the standard of care MCT oil therapy. Following discontinuation of MCT oil therapy, the average dose of UX007 was 30% of total daily caloric intake.
 The frequency and duration of major clinical events (MCEs) were reduced significantly during treatment with UX007. The MCE rate aggregates events related to hypoglycemia, cardiomyopathy and rhabdomyolysis. For this study, events that qualified included those that led to a hospitalization, emergency room visit, or an emergency intervention at home. There was a 48.1 percent reduction (p=0.0208) in the mean annualized rate of MCEs and a 50.3 percent reduction (p=0.0284) in the mean annualized duration of all MCEs after 78 weeks of treatment, compared to the mean annualized number and duration of events in the 18 to 24 months prior to treatment with UX007. Among the event subtypes, rhabdomyolysis was the predominant MCE and there were fewer hypoglycemia events and only a few cardiomyopathy events. There was a reduction in the mean annualized rates and total duration of all events for rhabdomyolysis, cardiomyopathy, and hypoglycemia events after initiation of treatment with UX007. These findings were generally comparable to those observed in the retrospective compassionate use study previously conducted by Ultragenyx with partial reduction in rhabdomyolysis and near complete reduction of hypoglycemia events.

Improvements were observed in both measures of exercise tolerance (cycle ergometry and 12 minute walk test) in musculoskeletal patients who performed the tests. At 24 weeks, patients showed improvements in both workload and duration. Seven patients (who qualified by age and performed the test at baseline) produced a mean 60% increase in watts over baseline representing a mean increase of +446.8 watts (median: +127.5; min, max: -388, +2438). The mean duration was increased in three patients who did not complete all 40 minutes at baseline. The cycle ergometry test at 78 weeks was inconclusive and uninterpretable due to missing data as a result of scheduling conflicts, withdrawal of consent, intercurrent illness and other factors. Eight qualified patients demonstrated a mean 28% increase of +188 meters (median: 93.5; min, max: -80, +880) at week 18 in the 12-minute walk test. These patients also experienced an improvement in the mean energy expenditure index (a ratio of heart rate per meter walked). The increase in distance walked observed at 18 weeks was maintained through 60 weeks. At week 60, the eight patients who completed the test showed a 29.7 percent improvement (mean increase: +199.8 meters; median: 149.5; min, max: -122, 1000) from a baseline of 673.4 meters. 
 Health Related Quality of life was assessed in the Phase 2 study using age appropriate SF-10™ (5-17 years, n=3) and SF-12v2® (>18 years, n=5) Health Surveys. Significant improvements in the impaired physical summary measures (SF-12v2 Physical Component Summary and SF-10 Physical Health Summary) reported at the start of the study were observed after 78 weeks of treatment with UX007.
 Overall, 19 patients (66%) had treatment-related adverse events, most of which were mild-to-moderate in nature. The most common treatment-related adverse events were diarrhea, abdominal/gastrointestinal pain, and vomiting. Some gastrointestinal events were managed by adjusting dosing or dosing with food. The most common adverse events, including those not deemed treatment-related, were diarrhea, rhabdomyolysis, vomiting, viral infections, gastrointestinal disorders, headache and fever. Five of the 29 enrolled patients discontinued treatment over the course of the study. One patient discontinued due to diarrhea in week 1, which resolved within a few days of discontinuation, and four patients withdrew consent (weeks 1, 8, 8, 78) for reasons not attributed to treatment with UX007. There were no deaths. There was one previously reported treatment-related serious adverse event for moderate gastroenteritis with vomiting. This patient maintained dosing throughout the event, which has resolved and continues to be treated. 
 We continue to further develop the Phase 3 study design and endpoints before meeting with regulators and initiating the study in 2017. Please see “—License and Collaboration Agreements—Baylor Research Institute” for a description of our license agreement with Baylor Research Institute.
 UX007 for the treatment of Glut1 DS
 We are also developing UX007 for patients with Glut1 DS. Glut1 DS is caused by a mutation affecting the gene that codes for Glut1, which is a protein that transports glucose from the blood into the brain. Because glucose is the primary source of energy for the brain, Glut1 DS results in a chronic state of brain energy deficiency and is characterized by seizures, developmental delay, and movement disorder. There are currently no approved drugs specific to Glut1 DS. The current standard of care for Glut1 DS is the ketogenic diet, an extreme high-fat (70-80% of daily calories as fat)/low-carbohydrate diet, which generates ketone bodies as an alternative energy source to glucose, and one or more antiepileptic drugs. The ketogenic diet can be effective in reducing seizures but compliance can be difficult, and the effectiveness of the diet in the treatment of developmental delay and movement disorders has not been confirmed. In addition, ketogenic diet can lead to side effects including renal stones. In general, Glut1 DS patients are considered relatively refractory to antiepileptic drugs with only approximately 8% achieving seizure control on antiepileptic drugs alone. There are currently no antiepileptic drugs approved specifically for patients with Glut1 DS.
 UX007 is intended as a substrate replacement therapy to provide an alternative source of energy to the brain in Glut1 DS patients. There are open-label investigator-sponsored clinical studies ongoing, and there is one publication presenting data on absence seizure reduction and improved developmental function in some Glut1 DS subjects taking UX007.
 In March 2014, we initiated a Phase 2 global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical study that planned to enroll up to 40 patients who are currently not fully compliant with ketogenic diet and continue to have seizures. The primary efficacy objective is the reduction in frequency of seizures compared to placebo following a 6-week baseline period and subsequent 8-week placebo-controlled treatment period. Other efficacy objectives include cognitive function and movement disorder. The blinded treatment period is followed by an open-label extension period in which patients are treated with UX007 through week 52. In order to accelerate enrollment, we amended the enrollment criteria to also include patients with only absence seizures. We have completed enrollment of 36 patients, and data are expected in the first quarter of 2017.
 In April 2015, positive data from an investigator-sponsored study of UX007 for the treatment of movement disorders associated with Glut1 DS were presented at the American Academy of Neurology Annual Meeting. The data showed a statistically significant 90% reduction in movement disorder events after treatment with UX007 (p=0.028) and a statistically significant increase in events after withdrawal from treatment with UX007 (p=0.043). Triheptanoin was well tolerated in all patients. Two patients were considered not compliant for reasons unrelated to safety or tolerability. 
 We plan to initiate a Phase 3 study in approximately 40 Glut1 DS patients with the movement disorder phenotype in the first quarter of 2017. The study will be randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, double cross-over study. We expect to enroll approximately 40 patients and assess the impact of UX007 on disabling movement disorder events as recorded by a patient diary.

Ace-ER (UX001) for the treatment of GNE myopathy
 We are developing Ace-ER, which is an extended-release, oral formulation of sialic acid for the treatment of GNE myopathy, which is also known as hereditary inclusion body myopathy, or HIBM. GNE myopathy is characterized by severe progressive muscular myopathy, or disease in which muscle fibers do not function properly, with onset typically in the late teens or twenties. Patients with GNE myopathy have a genetic defect in the gene coding for a particular enzyme that is involved in the first step in the biosynthesis of sialic acid. Therefore, GNE myopathy patients have a sialic acid deficiency, which interferes with muscle function, leading to myopathy and atrophy. Patients typically lose major muscle function within ten to 20 years of diagnosis. There is no approved drug therapy for GNE myopathy.
 Ace-ER is intended as a potential substrate replacement therapy designed to address sialic acid deficiency and restore muscle function in GNE myopathy patients. We have conducted a Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of Ace-ER in 47 GNE myopathy patients. Data from this study were presented at the American Academy of Neurology Annual Meeting in April 2014. Patients in the study were initially randomized to receive placebo, three grams, or six grams of Ace-ER per day. After 24 weeks, placebo patients crossed over to either three grams or six grams total daily dose, for an additional 24 weeks. The final analysis compared change at week 48 from baseline for the combined group at six grams versus the combined group at three grams of Ace-ER. Assessments included pharmacokinetics, composites of upper extremity and lower extremity muscle strength as measured by dynamometry, other clinical endpoints, patient reported outcomes, and safety.
 At 24 weeks, assessments of upper extremity composite of muscle strength showed a statistically significant difference in the six-gram group compared to placebo (+2.33 kg; 5.5% relative difference from baseline; p=0.040). At 48 weeks, a statistically significant difference between the combined six-gram group and the combined three-gram group was observed (+3.44 kg; 8.5% relative difference from baseline; p=0.0033). Patients with less advanced disease (able to walk more than 200 meters at baseline), a predefined subset, showed a more pronounced difference (+4.69 kg; 9.6% relative difference from baseline; p=0.00055). The lower extremity composite showed a similar pattern of response but did not show a statistically significant difference between the dose groups. None of the groups showed a significant decline in the lower extremity composite during the treatment period. A positive trend was seen in patient-reported outcomes of functional activity suggesting potential clinical meaningfulness of the muscle strength assessment. Ace-ER appeared to be well tolerated with no serious adverse events observed to date in either dose group, and no dose-dependent treatment-emergent adverse events were identified. Most adverse events were mild to moderate and the most commonly reported adverse events were gastrointestinal in nature and pain related to muscle biopsy procedures.
 We continued to treat these patients in an extension study evaluating an increased daily dosage of sialic acid based on the dose dependence observed at weeks 24 and 48. Interim data from the extension study were presented at the International Congress of the World Muscle Society, or WMS, in October 2014. In the first part of the extension study, all 46 patients who completed the 48-week Phase 2 study crossed over to six grams for a variable period of time that was on average 24 weeks. In the second part of the extension study, all 46 patients and 13 treatment-naïve patients received 12 grams of Ace-ER for 24 weeks. The results presented at WMS included the 49 out of 59 patients who had 24 weeks of data at the higher dose. While the 12-gram data did not suggest any clinically meaningful advantage over six grams, the 12-gram data do provide additional data that supported potential clinical activity with Ace-ER treatment. The higher dose appeared to be generally safe and well tolerated with no drug-related serious adverse events, but the rate of mild to moderate gastrointestinal adverse events did appear to be greater with this dose. Throughout the approximately two-year study period, treatment with Ace-ER appeared to slow the progression of upper extremity disease when compared to the 24-week placebo group extrapolated out to two years.
 In October 2015, we announced the filing and acceptance for review of an MAA seeking conditional approval from the EMA based on our Phase 2 study results for the use of six grams per day of Ace-ER tablets in the treatment of GNE myopathy. In November 2016, we withdrew the MAA based on feedback received during the CHMP meeting indicating that the Phase 2 study was encouraging, but did not provide a sufficient amount of evidence to support conditional approval at that time. We completed enrollment of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 48-week pivotal Phase 3 study of Ace-ER in 89 patients with GNE myopathy in July 2016. The primary endpoint of the study is a composite of upper extremity muscle strength as measured by hand-held dynamometry. Key secondary endpoints include the GNE Myopathy-functional activity scale, a disease-specific PRO that measures mobility and upper-extremity function, and other measures of lower-extremity muscle strength. The Phase 2 study evaluated the same endpoints. The Phase 3 study design was discussed with the FDA and the EMA with supportive feedback for registration purposes from both agencies. Data from the Phase 3 study are expected in the second half of 2017. We plan to submit an NDA and MAA based on the Phase 3 data, if positive.

Preclinical Pipeline
 rhPPCA (UX004) for the treatment of galactosialidosis
 Recombinant human protective protein cathepsin-A, or rhPPCA, which we in-licensed from St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, or St. Jude, in September 2012, is in preclinical development as an enzyme replacement therapy for galactosialidosis, a rare lysosomal storage disease for which there are no currently approved drug therapies. Similar to MPS patients, patients with galactosialidosis present with both soft tissue storage in the liver, spleen, and other tissues, as well as connective tissue (bone and cartilage) related disease. As with MPS 7, an enzyme deficiency results in accumulation of substrates in the lysosomes, causing skeletal and organ dysfunction, and death. We are continuing preclinical development of rhPPCA. Please see “—License and Collaboration Agreements—St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital” for a description of our license agreement with St. Jude.
 Collaboration with Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc. for mRNA therapeutics
 We signed a research collaboration and license agreement with Arcturus Therapeutics, Inc. to develop mRNA therapeutics for select rare disease targets in October 2015. The Arcturus collaboration may help us address a wider range of rare diseases than possible with current approaches. As part of the collaboration, Arcturus will utilize its UNA Oligomer™ chemistry and LUNAR™ nanoparticle delivery platform to initially design and optimize mRNA therapeutics for two targets selected by us; we also have the option to add up to eight additional targets during the collaborative research period.
 Collaboration with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited
 We entered into a strategic partnership with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, or Takeda, to develop and commercialize therapies to treat rare genetic diseases in June 2016. As part of the collaboration, we received an exclusive license to one preclinical Takeda product candidate in a pre-determined field of use, and have an exclusive option to co-develop and co-commercialize the product candidate in additional therapeutic areas. We have also established a five-year research collaboration with Takeda in which we will have the option to license up to five additional Takeda product candidates for rare diseases.
 Other preclinical programs
 We continue to work on other compounds in various preclinical stages of development. 
 Competition 
 The commercialization of new drugs is competitive, and we may face worldwide competition from individual investigators, major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, nutraceutical companies, and ultimately biosimilar and generic companies. Our competitors may develop or market therapies that are more effective, safer, or less costly than any that may be commercialized by us, or may obtain regulatory approval for their therapies more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours. 
 The acquisition or licensing of pharmaceutical products is also very competitive, and a number of more established companies, which have acknowledged strategies to license or acquire products, may have competitive advantages as may other emerging companies taking similar or different approaches to product acquisitions. These established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, cash flows, and institutional experience. 
 With respect to KRN23, although we are not aware of any other products currently in clinical development for the treatment of XLH, it is possible that competitors may produce, develop, and commercialize therapeutics, or utilize other approaches such as gene therapy, to treat XLH. Most pediatric patients with XLH are managed using oral phosphate replacement and/or vitamin D therapy, which is relatively inexpensive and therefore may adversely affect our ability to commercialize KRN23, if approved, in some countries. 
 With respect to rhGUS and rhPPCA, we are not aware of any other compounds currently in clinical development for MPS 7 or galactosialidosis, but it is possible that other companies may produce, develop, and commercialize compounds that might treat these diseases. Additionally, gene therapy and other therapeutic approaches may emerge for the treatment of lysosomal diseases. Bone marrow or stem cell transplants have also been used in MPS 7 and in other lysosomal storage diseases and represent a potential competing therapy. Stem cell transplants have been effective in treating soft tissue storage and in having an impact on brain disease, but have not to date proven effective in treating bone and connective tissue disease. Typically, enzyme replacement therapy has had an impact on bone and connective tissue disease in other disorders when patients were treated early. 
 12


With respect to UX007/triheptanoin, there are currently no approved drugs or treatments for patients with LC-FAOD or Glut1 DS. LC-FAOD is commonly treated with diet therapy and MCT oil, and UX007 would compete with MCT oil. Glut1 DS is commonly treated with ketogenic diet and antiepileptic drugs. UX007 may compete with these approaches. Although we believe that UX007 should be considered a drug and will be regulated that way, it is possible that other companies or individuals may attempt to produce triheptanoin for use in LC-FAOD, Glut1 DS, and other patients by attempting to sell the product via a nutritional supplement or medical food pathway. Investigators are testing triheptanoin in clinical studies across multiple indications, including LC-FAOD and Glut1 DS. For example, B. Braun Medical Inc., or B. Braun, has applied for and received orphan drug designation for triheptanoin for the treatment of certain types of LC-FAOD in Europe; however, we are not aware of any ongoing clinical development activities by B. Braun. It is also possible that other companies may produce, develop, and commercialize other medium odd-chain fatty acids, or completely different compounds, to treat LC-FAOD and Glut1 DS. Other companies may also utilize other approaches, such as gene therapy, to treat LC-FAOD and Glut1 DS. 
 With respect to Ace-ER, although there are currently no approved drug therapies for the treatment of HIBM, it is possible that others may develop alternative approaches to the treatment of HIBM, including other metabolites from the sialic acid pathway, prodrugs, other drug therapies, and gene therapy. We are aware of a program at the National Institutes of Health that is investigating the use of another metabolite in the sialic acid pathway, N-acetyl mannosamine, or ManNAc, for the treatment of HIBM. Escala Therapeutics Inc. (a subsidiary of Fortress Biotech) acquired from New Zealand Pharmaceuticals Ltd, a license from the NIH for the development of ManNAc for the treatment of GNE Myopathy. New Zealand Pharmaceuticals manufactures ManNAc and is its exclusive global supplier to Escala Therapeutics. We believe that a Phase 1 clinical study has been completed and an open-label, three-month Phase 2 study is ongoing. 
 Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, and human resources than we have. Additional mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical industry may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors. Competition may increase further as a result of advances made in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these fields. Our success will be based in part on our ability to build and actively manage a portfolio of drugs that addresses unmet medical needs and creates value in patient therapy. 
 License and Collaboration Agreements 
 Our current product candidate pipeline has been either in-licensed from academic institutions or derived from partnerships with other pharmaceutical companies. Following is a description of our significant license and collaboration agreements.
Kyowa Hakko Kirin 
 In August 2013, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with KHK. Under the terms of this collaboration and license agreement, as amended, we and KHK will collaborate on the development and commercialization of certain products containing KRN23 in the field of orphan diseases in the United States and Canada, or the “profit-share territory”, and in the European Union, Switzerland, and Turkey, or the European territory, and we will have the right to develop and commercialize such products in the field of orphan diseases in Mexico and Central and South America, or Latin America. In the field of orphan diseases, and except for ongoing studies being conducted by KHK, we will be the lead party for development activities in the profit-share territory and in the European territory until the applicable transition date; we will also be the lead party for core development activities conducted in Japan and Korea for which the core development plan is limited to clinical trials mutually agreed to by us and KHK. We will share the costs for development activities in the profit share territory and European territory conducted pursuant to the development plan before the applicable transition date equally with KHK and KHK shall be responsible for 100% of the costs for development activities in Japan and Korea. On the applicable transition date in the profit-share territory and the European territory, KHK will become the lead party and be responsible for the costs of the development activities. However, we will continue to share the costs of the studies commenced prior to the applicable transition date equally with KHK. We have the primary responsibility for conducting certain research and development activities. We are obligated to provide assistance in accordance with the agreed upon development plan as well as participate on various committees. If KRN23 is approved, we and KHK will share commercial responsibilities and profits in the profit share territory until the applicable transition date, KHK will commercialize KRN23 in the European territory, and we will develop and commercialize KRN23 in Latin America. KHK will manufacture and supply KRN23 for clinical use globally and will manufacture and supply KRN23 for commercial use in the profit share territory and Latin America. 
 In the profit share territory, KHK will book sales of products and we will have the sole right to promote the products for a specified period of time, with KHK increasingly participating in the promotion of the products until five years from commercial launch, after which KHK will have the sole right to promote the products, subject to a limited promotion right retained by us. In the European territory, KHK will book sales of products and have the sole right to promote and sell the products. In Latin America, we will book sales of products and have the sole right to promote and sell the products. 
 KHK will supply all quantities of product for clinical studies. KHK will also supply all quantities of product for commercial sales in the profit-share territory and in Latin America. The supply price to us for commercial sales in the profit-share territory and in Latin America will be determined based on a fixed double-digit percentage of net sales. 
 13


The remaining profit or loss from commercializing products in the profit-share territory, until the applicable transition date, will be shared between us and KHK on a 50/50 basis. Thereafter, we will be entitled to receive a tiered double-digit revenue share in the mid-to-high 20% range in the profit share territory, intended to approximate the profit share. We will also be entitled to receive a royalty of up to 10% on net sales in the European territory. In Latin America, we will pay to KHK a low single-digit royalty on net sales. Our and KHK’s obligations to pay royalties will continue on a country-by-country basis for so long as we or KHK, as applicable, are selling products in such country. 
 The collaboration and license agreement will continue for as long as products in the field of orphan diseases are sold in the profit-share territory, European territory, or Latin America, unless the agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms. 
 KHK may terminate the agreement in certain countries or territories based upon our failure to meet certain milestones. Specifically, if we do not obtain U.S. or European marketing approval of KRN23 for the treatment of XLH by a certain date, or make a first commercial sale, on a country-by-country basis, in Latin America by certain deadlines, KHK may terminate the agreement only with respect to the applicable territory or country in which the milestone was not timely met. In certain circumstances, we have the right to obtain an extension of the applicable deadline by making a payment to KHK in the low single-digit to low double-digit millions of dollars, depending on the milestone. Also, in the event of the occurrence of certain excusable delays, the deadline for meeting the applicable milestone above is extended to account for the period of the delay. Furthermore, either party may terminate the agreement for the material breach or bankruptcy of the other party. In any event of termination by KHK, unless such termination is the result of KHK’s termination for certain types of breach of the agreement by us, we may receive low single-digit to low double-digit royalties on net post-termination sales by KHK in one or more countries or territories, the amount of which varies depending on the timing of, and reason for, such termination. In any event of termination, our rights to KRN23 under the agreement and our obligations to share development costs will cease, and the program will revert to KHK, worldwide if the agreement is terminated as a whole or solely in the terminated countries if the agreement is terminated solely with respect to certain countries. 
 Saint Louis University 
 In November 2010, we entered into a license agreement with Saint Louis University, or SLU, wherein SLU granted us certain exclusive rights to intellectual property related to GUS. Under the terms of the license agreement, SLU granted us an exclusive worldwide license to make, have made, use, import, offer for sale, and sell therapeutics related to SLU’s beta-glucuronidase product, such as our rhGUS product candidate, for use in the treatment of human diseases. Under this agreement, we agreed to use best efforts to develop and commercialize a licensed product as soon as practicable consistent with sound and reasonable business practices and judgment. 
 Under the license agreement, upon reaching a certain level of worldwide sales of the product, we will pay to SLU a low single-digit royalty on net sales of the licensed products in any country or region, subject to certain potential deductions. Our obligation to pay royalties to SLU continues on a country-by-country basis until the expiration of the last-to-expire licensed patent covering the product in such country or, in the United States, Japan, and the EU, until the later expiration of any orphan drug exclusivity. We may terminate the agreement for convenience at any time and SLU may terminate the agreement for our material breach, bankruptcy, or challenge of the licensed patents or technology, and SLU may terminate the agreement or render our license non-exclusive if we fail to meet our diligence obligations. Unless terminated as set forth above, this license agreement continues in full force and effect until the latest of expiration of the last patent based on technology licensed under the agreement, at which point our license becomes fully paid. 
 Baylor Research Institute 
 In September 2012, we entered into a license agreement with Baylor Research Institute, or BRI, under which we exclusively licensed certain intellectual property related to triheptanoin . The license includes patents, patent applications, know-how, and intellectual property related to the composition and formulation of triheptanoin as well as its use in treating a number of orphan diseases, including FAOD. The license grant includes the sole right to develop, manufacture, and commercialize licensed products for all human and animal uses. Under the license agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize licensed products in select orphan indications. If we fail to meet our diligence obligations with respect to a specified orphan indication or set of orphan indications, BRI may convert our license to a non-exclusive license with respect to such orphan indication or set of orphan indications until we receive regulatory approval for licensed products in the applicable orphan indication or set of orphan indications. We are also obligated to pay a mid-single digit royalty on net sales to BRI, subject to certain reductions and offsets. Our obligation to pay royalties to BRI continues on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis until the later of the expiration of the first regulatory exclusivity granted with respect to such product in such country or the expiration of the last-to-expire licensed patent claiming such product in such country, in each case in connection with approval in such country for FAOD or an orphan disease covered by our license from BRI. We may make future payments of up to $10.5 million contingent upon attainment of certain development milestones and $7.5 million if certain sales milestones are achieved. We may terminate the agreement for convenience at any time and either we or BRI may terminate the agreement for the material breach or bankruptcy of the other party. If we terminate for BRI’s breach or bankruptcy, our license from BRI will remain in effect, subject to our continued payment of reduced milestones and royalties. Unless terminated by its terms, this license agreement continues in full force and effect, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, until our royalty obligations expire, at which point our license from BRI with respect to such product in such country becomes irrevocable, perpetual, fully paid and royalty-free.

Nobelpharma 
 In September 2010, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Nobelpharma Co., Ltd. (Nobelpharma). Under the terms of this collaboration and license agreement, as amended, each party granted the other party a worldwide exclusive license under certain of that party’s intellectual property related to the compound identified as N-acetylneuraminic acid, also known as sialic acid, to develop, manufacture, and commercialize products. Nobelpharma’s licensed territory includes Japan and certain other Asian countries, and our licensed territory includes the rest of the world. The parties conduct development independently, and each party is obligated to make commercially reasonable efforts to file an investigational new drug application, or IND, for licensed products in its territory and, in our case, to obtain patent term extensions and data exclusivity in Europe and North America, and share with the other party all data, documentation, and information that is generated in conducting such activities. Nobelpharma must use commercially reasonable efforts to supply us with the sialic acid drug substance. Either Nobelpharma or we can terminate this supply arrangement for convenience, at which point Nobelpharma would provide technical assistance to allow us to manufacture the sialic acid drug substance ourselves. If we choose to manufacture the sialic acid drug substance, Nobelpharma will have the right to purchase the sialic acid drug substance from us and we will use commercially reasonable efforts to supply Nobelpharma with the sialic acid drug substance. 
 Under the collaboration and license agreement, we are required to make certain payments to Nobelpharma based upon achievement of certain development and approval milestones. We will pay a mid-single digit royalty on net sales in our territory and will receive a mid-single digit royalty on net sales in the Nobelpharma territory, excluding Japan, if such product sales are ever achieved. 
 If either party terminates the agreement, the terminating party’s license will become irrevocable and royalty-free. Unless terminated by its terms, this license agreement continues in full force and effect, on a country-by-country basis, until the date of the first launch of a generic product of the licensed product in a country.
 Alcami Corporation 
 In March 2011, we entered into a license agreement with Alcami Corporation (formerly known as AAIPharma Services Corp.), or Alcami. Under the terms of this license agreement, Alcami granted us a fully paid-up, royalty-free, exclusive, perpetual, and irrevocable license to research, develop, make, have made, use, import, offer for sale, and sell products incorporating Alcami’s controlled release matrix solid dose oral tablet technology for use in connection with sialic acid for the treatment of HIBM or distal myopathy with rimmed vacuoles. Under the license agreement, we will pay a mid-single digit percentage of any sublicense revenue received by us related to the sublicense of Alcami technology and we agreed to provide preclinical and clinical data to Alcami. Alcami is responsible for patent prosecution and maintenance. We may terminate the agreement for convenience at any time and either party may terminate the agreement for the material breach or bankruptcy of the other party. 
HIBM Research Group 
 In April 2012, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with HIBM Research Group, or HRG, wherein HRG granted us an exclusive, worldwide license to certain intellectual property related to the treatment of HIBM and related conditions using substrate replacement therapy. 
 Under the terms of the license agreement, we will pay to HRG a royalty of less than 1% of net sales of products, if any. Our obligation to pay royalties to HRG continues on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the expiration of the last-to-expire licensed patent claiming such product in such country, or the later expiration of orphan drug exclusivity in certain countries. We are obligated to make commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize a substrate replacement therapy for HIBM. We may terminate the agreement for convenience at any time and either party may terminate the agreement for the material breach or bankruptcy of the other party. We must also terminate the agreement if we terminate our HIBM substrate replacement therapy program. Unless terminated by its terms, this license agreement continues in full force and effect, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, until the expiration date of the last-to-expire licensed patent claiming such product in such country, or the later expiration of orphan drug exclusivity in certain countries, at which point our license becomes irrevocable, perpetual, fully paid, and royalty-free. 
 St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital 
 In September 2012, we entered into a license agreement with St. Jude wherein St. Jude granted us certain exclusive rights to intellectual property related to rhPPCA. Under the terms of the license agreement, St. Jude granted us an exclusive license under certain know-how to research, develop, make, use, offer to sell, import, and otherwise commercialize and exploit certain PPCA protein products to treat, prevent, and/or diagnose galactosialidosis and other monogenetic diseases. We agreed to make commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize at least one licensed product. 
 15


Under the license agreement, we will pay to St. Jude a royalty of less than 1% on net sales of these products for so long as such products retain orphan drug exclusivity, on a country-by-country basis. We may terminate the agreement for convenience at any time and St. Jude may terminate the agreement for our material breach of the agreement. Unless terminated by its terms, this license agreement continues in full force and effect, until our royalty obligations expire, at which point our license becomes irrevocable, perpetual, fully paid, and royalty-free. 
 Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited
 In June 2016, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Takeda. Under the terms of the license agreement, we obtained, among other things, an exclusive license for a pre-clinical compound from Takeda in a pre-determined field of use, which includes an option to an additional field of use for this product. We are responsible for the development costs for the pre-clinical compound pursuant to an initial development plan and we may be required to make future milestone payments to Takeda of up to $7.5 million if certain development milestones are met, $75.0 million if certain regulatory milestones are met, and $150.0 million if certain commercial milestones are met. We will also pay to Takeda royalties with respect to net sales in the high-single digits to low-teens. 
 As part of the agreement, we established a five-year research collaboration with Takeda whereby the parties may mutually agree to add additional option products candidates to the collaboration, in which case we will bear the cost of the development activities, with certain exceptions.  
 We also granted Takeda an exclusive option for Asian rights, for a limited period, to any licensed products and any additional products resulting from the collaboration, as well as an option to exclusively license one of our products for development and commercialization in Japan. If Takeda exercises any of its option rights to license a product pursuant to the agreement, Takeda will pay for the development costs within the licensed territory, will share in a portion of the global development costs, and will make a milestone payment upon regulatory approval. Takeda will also owe royalties on net sales in the licensed territory for any licensed product, depending on the development stage when the product is licensed as well as sales levels. The royalties related to the option to license our product, as well as the additional product are subject to future good faith negotiations at the time that the option is exercised.
 Patents and Proprietary Rights 
 The proprietary nature of, and protection for, our product candidates, processes, and know-how are important to our business. Our success depends in part on our ability to protect the proprietary nature of our product candidates, technology, and know-how, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others, and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. We seek patent protection in the United States and internationally for our product candidates and other technology. Our policy is to patent or in-license the technology, inventions and improvements that we consider important to the development of our business. In addition to patent protection, we intend to use other means to protect our proprietary rights, including pursuing marketing or data exclusivity periods, orphan drug status, and similar rights that are available under regulatory provisions in certain countries, including the United States, Europe, Japan, and China. See “Government Regulation—U.S. Government Regulation — Orphan Designation and Exclusivity,” “Government Regulation—U.S. Government Regulation — Pediatric Studies and Exclusivity,” “Government Regulation—U.S. Government Regulation — Patent Term Restoration,” “Government Regulation—U.S. Government Regulation — Biosimilars and Exclusivity,” “Government Regulation—U.S. Government Regulation — Abbreviated New Drug Applications for Generic Drugs,” and “Government Regulation—European Union Regulation — Orphan Designation and Exclusivity” below for additional information. 
 We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We cannot be certain that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our technology. 
 We seek regulatory approval for our products in disease areas with high unmet medical need, significant market potential, and where we expect to have a proprietary position through patents covering various aspects of our products, such as composition, dosage, formulation, use, and manufacturing process, among others. Our success depends in part on an intellectual property portfolio that supports our future revenue streams and erects barriers to our competitors. We are maintaining and building our patent portfolio through filing new patent applications, prosecuting existing applications, and licensing and acquiring new patents and patent applications. 
 Despite these measures, any of our intellectual property and proprietary rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated, or such intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be sufficient to achieve or maintain market exclusivity or otherwise to provide competitive advantages. For more information, please see “Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”

As of December 31, 2016, we own six issued U.S. patent and 12 pending U.S. patent applications as well as corresponding patents and patent applications internationally. In addition, we have licensed several issued U.S. patents and pending U.S. patent applications, as well as corresponding foreign patents and applications from third parties, on an exclusive basis. With respect to our issued patents in the United States and Europe, we are also entitled to obtain a patent term extension to extend the patent expiration date. For example, in the United States, we can apply for a patent term extension of up to five years for one of the patents covering a product once the product is approved by the FDA. The exact duration of the extension depends on the time we spend in clinical studies as well as getting marketing approval from the FDA. The patent portfolios for our five leading product candidates as of December 31, 2016 are summarized below.
 KRN23 
 We have rights from KHK to patents and patent applications relating to KRN23, a fully human monoclonal antibody against FGF23, and its use for the treatment of XLH and various other hypophosphatemic conditions. Pursuant to this license, we share rights to 22 issued patents, including four U.S. patents and two pending U.S. applications, as well as patents and applications in other jurisdictions covering generic and specific antibodies against FGF23 as well as their use for the treatment of XLH and related conditions. The patent terms for issued patents in the United States are from 2022 to 2029 (without patent term extension). The projected patent terms for pending applications in the United States are from 2028 to 2035. We intend to pursue marketing and orphan drug exclusivity periods that are available to us under regulatory provisions in certain countries. KRN23 has received orphan drug designation in the United States and Europe for the treatment of XLH. 
 rhGUS 
 We have two U.S. patents, one pending U.S. patent application and corresponding foreign patent applications relating to rhGUS and its use in the treatment of lysosomal storage disorders such as MPS 7. The patents in the United States expire in 2035 (without patent term extension). The projected patent terms for the pending application in the United States and the foreign patent applications is 2035. Throughout clinical research and development, we also intend to file patent applications directed to various aspects of the treatment therapy including dosage, regimen, formulation, and manufacturing, among others. We intend to pursue marketing and orphan drug exclusivity periods that are available under regulatory provisions in certain countries. rhGUS has received orphan drug designation in both the United States and Europe for the treatment of MPS 7. 
 UX007 
 We are the licensee or owner of patents and patent applications relating to UX007 and its use for a number of diseases including FAOD and Glut1 DS. In particular, we have an exclusive license from Baylor Research Institute, or BRI, with respect to its UX007 patent portfolio. We have licensed from BRI 33 issued patents, including 11 U.S. patents and four pending U.S. applications and patents and applications in other jurisdictions covering composition, formulation, use and manufacturing of UX007 and related odd carbon fatty acids. The patent terms for issued patents in the United States are from 2020 to 2033 (without patent term extension). The projected patent terms for pending applications in the United States are from 2020 to 2033. We intend to pursue marketing and orphan drug exclusivity periods that are available under regulatory provisions in certain countries. UX007 for the treatment of FAOD and Glut1 DS has received orphan drug designation in the United States. 
 Ace-ER 
 We are the licensee or owner of patents and patent applications relating to sialic acid and its use for the treatment of HIBM. We own or have rights to three issued U.S. patents and seven pending U.S. applications and patents and applications in other jurisdictions covering the use of sialic acid for the treatment of HIBM, as well as extended release formulations of sialic acid. The patent terms for the issued patents in the United States are from 2031 to 2032 (without patent term extension). The projected patent terms for pending applications in the United States are from 2028 to 2031. 
 We intend to pursue marketing and orphan drug exclusivity periods that are available under regulatory provisions in certain countries. Ace-ER has received orphan drug designation in both the United States and the EU for the treatment of HIBM. 
 rhPPCA 
 We are the licensee of 1 issued U.S. patent, 1 pending U.S. patent application, and corresponding foreign patent applications relating to the use of rhPPCA for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Specifically, we have an exclusive license from the St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, or St. Jude. Furthermore, we intend to build a patent portfolio directed to rhPPCA compositions with certain characteristics that are useful for the enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disease as well as various aspects of the treatment therapy including dosage, regimen, formulation, manufacturing, etc. We intend to pursue marketing and orphan drug exclusivity periods that are available under regulatory provisions in certain countries.

Trademarks 
 We have filed trademark applications for the Ultragenyx brand, among others, in the U.S. and multiple other jurisdictions. 
 Other 
 We rely upon unpatented trade secrets, know-how, and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our ownership of know-how and trade secrets through an active program of legal mechanisms including assignments, confidentiality agreements, material transfer agreements, research collaborations, and licenses.
Manufacturing 
 We currently contract with third parties for the manufacturing and testing of our product candidates for preclinical studies and clinical studies and intend to do so in the future. We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical quantities of our product candidates. We currently have no plans to build our own clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. The use of contracted manufacturing and reliance on collaboration partners is relatively cost-efficient and has eliminated the need for our direct investment in manufacturing facilities and additional staff early in development. Although we rely on contract manufacturers, we have personnel with extensive manufacturing experience to oversee our contract manufacturers. All of our third-party manufacturers will be subject to periodic audits to confirm compliance with applicable regulations and must pass inspection before we can manufacture our drugs for commercial sales.
 To date, our third-party manufacturers have met our manufacturing requirements. We expect third-party manufacturers to be capable of providing sufficient quantities of our product candidates to meet anticipated full scale commercial demands. To meet our projected needs for commercial manufacturing, third parties with whom we currently work might need to increase their scale of production or we will need to secure alternate suppliers. We believe that there are alternate sources of supply that can satisfy our clinical and commercial requirements, although we cannot be certain that identifying and establishing relationships with such sources, if necessary, would not result in significant delay or material additional costs. 
 KRN23 
 The drug substance and drug product for KRN23 are made by KHK in Japan under the collaboration and license agreement with KHK. The cell line to produce KRN23 is specific for this product and is in KHK’s control. All other raw materials are commercially available. 
 rhGUS 
 rhGUS drug substance and drug product are manufactured by Rentschler Biotechnologie GmbH, or Rentschler, under a development and clinical supply agreement executed in August 2012. Pursuant to the clinical supply agreement, we have agreed not to source larger quantities of drug substance or drug product from another supplier than from Rentschler in any given year. The supply agreement will continue in full force and effect until all clinical services have been completed or terminated per the terms of the supply agreement. Either party may terminate the supply agreement if the other party fails to pay any sum payable under the supply agreement within 30 days after a written demand is issued after the original due date, if the other party makes a material misrepresentation or commits a material breach of its obligations under the supply agreement and fails to cure such breach within specified time periods if curable, if the other party ceases to carry on its business for a period no less than 60 days, or if a party experiences certain insolvency events. Additionally, either party may terminate the supply agreement upon 30 days’ prior written notice if the Steering Committee concludes that the services required under the supply agreement cannot be performed and we may terminate the agreement at any time before completion of the services rendered pursuant to the agreement upon 60 days’ prior written notice. The cell line to produce rhGUS is specific for this product and is in our control and stored in multiple secure locations. All other raw materials are commercially available. 
 UX007 
 The pharmaceutical-grade drug substance for UX007 is manufactured by IOI Oleo GmbH in Germany under an exclusive worldwide supply agreement, subject to certain limitations, executed in 2012. In 2012, Malaysian conglomerate IOI Corporation signed an agreement to acquire Cremer Oleo’s oleo chemicals business in Germany. The supply agreement has an initial term of three years; thereafter, the agreement shall be automatically renewed for additional two-year periods unless either party notifies the other party of its intention not to renew in writing at least three calendar months before the expiration of the then current term. Additionally, if a party materially breaches an obligation under the agreement and does not cure such breach within 60 days of receiving notice of the breach from the non-breaching party, the non-breaching party may terminate the agreement immediately upon written notice to the breaching party. UX007 drug product manufacturing has been done with more than one party and is not considered a very specialized task.

Ace-ER 
 Evonik Nutrition & Care GmbH manufactures the drug substance for Ace-ER in Germany. The drug substance for Ace-ER is also currently manufactured by Sanyo Fine Co., Ltd. in Japan through the license agreement with Nobelpharma. The Ace-ER drug product is manufactured by Alcami under our license agreement and accompanying purchase orders with Alcami. We are in the process of securing secondary sources of drug substance and drug product for Ace-ER. Manufacture of the drug substance requires a specialized enzyme-catalyzed step, and a secondary source of the enzyme itself is also under development. All raw materials to produce the drug substance and drug product are commercially available. The cell line to produce the specialized enzyme is under our control and is stored in multiple secured locations. 
 rhPPCA 
 No commercial supplier has yet been selected to manufacture rhPPCA. The cell line to produce rhPPCA is specific for this product and is in our control and stored in multiple secure locations. All other raw materials are commercially available. We are currently developing a manufacturing process for rhPPCA.
 Commercialization
 We are building our own commercial organizations in North America, Europe and Latin America to effectively support the commercialization of our product candidates. We may elect to utilize strategic partners, distributors, or contract organizations to assist in the commercialization of our products. The commercial infrastructure for rare disease products typically consists of a targeted, specialty field organization that calls on a limited and focused group of physicians supported by field management, medical liaisons, internal support, and distribution support. One challenge, unique to commercializing therapies for rare diseases, is the difficulty in identifying eligible patients due to the very small and sometimes heterogeneous disease populations. Our management team will focus on maximizing patient identification for both clinical development and commercialization purposes in rare diseases. 
 Additional capabilities important to the rare disease marketplace include the management of key accounts such as managed care organizations, group-purchasing organizations, specialty pharmacies, and government accounts. To develop the appropriate commercial infrastructure, we will have to invest significant amounts of financial and management resources, some of which will be committed prior to any confirmation that any of our product candidates will be approved. 
 Government Regulation 
 Government authorities in the United States (including federal, state, and local authorities) and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the manufacturing, research and clinical development, marketing, labeling and packaging, storage, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, advertising and promotion, pricing, and export and import of pharmaceutical products, such as those we are developing. We must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in the United States and foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical studies or marketing of the product in those countries. Accordingly, our operations are and will be subject to a variety of regulations and other requirements, which vary from country to country. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
Global Regulation of Clinical Studies 
 Clinical studies involve the administration of an investigational medicinal product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with protocols, GCP, the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki and applicable regulatory requirements. A protocol for each clinical study and any subsequent protocol amendments are typically submitted to the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities as part of an IND or clinical trial application, or CTA. Additionally, approval must also be obtained from each clinical study site’s institutional review board, or IRB, or Ethics Committee, or EC, before the studies may be initiated, and the IRB or EC must monitor the study until completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries. 
 The clinical investigation of a drug is generally divided into three or four phases. Although the phases are usually conducted sequentially, they may overlap or be combined. 
  
• | Phase 1. The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to evaluate the safety, dosage tolerance, pharmacokinetics and pharmacologic actions of the investigational new drug in humans, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. The drug is administered to a limited patient population to evaluate dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks, and preliminarily evaluate efficacy.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical study sites to generate enough data to statistically evaluate dosage, clinical effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational new drug product, and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 19


 
• | Phase 4. In some cases, additional studies and patient follow-up are conducted to gain experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. Regulatory authorities may condition approval of a marketing application for a product candidate on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical studies after approval. In other cases, a sponsor may voluntarily conduct additional clinical studies after approval to gain more information about the drug. Such post-approval studies are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical studies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 A pivotal study is a clinical study that adequately meets regulatory authority requirements for the evaluation of a drug candidate’s efficacy and safety such that it can be used to justify the approval of the product. Generally, pivotal studies are Phase 3 studies, but regulatory authorities may accept results from Phase 2 studies if the study design provides a well-controlled and reliable assessment of clinical benefit, particularly in situations where there is an unmet medical need and the results are sufficiently robust. 
 U.S. Government Regulation 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations, and biologics under the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and its implementing regulations. FDA approval is required before any new drug or dosage form, including a new use of a previously approved drug, can be marketed in the United States. Drugs and biologics are also subject to other federal, state, and local statutes and regulations. 
 The process required by the FDA before product candidates may be marketed or sold in the United States generally involves the following: 
  
• | completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests and preclinical animal studies performed in accordance with the Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical studies may begin and must be updated annually;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | conducting adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each proposed indication under an active IND and approved by an independent IRB representing each clinical site;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation of and submission to the FDA of an NDA, or biologics license application, or BLA, after completion of all pivotal clinical studies;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential review of the product application by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate and if applicable;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities where the proposed drug substance and drug product are produced to assess compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices, or GMP;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA inspection of one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with Good Clinical Practices, or GCP; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of an NDA or BLA.
--+------------------------------------------

 Submission of an NDA or BLA to the FDA 
 Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, detailed investigational new drug product information is submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs and BLAs is subject to a significant application user fee, unless waived.  
 Once an NDA or BLA has been submitted, the FDA’s goal is to review the application within ten months after it accepts the application for filing, or, if the application relates to an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. The review process can be significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. 
 The FDA’s Decision on an NDA or BLA 
 The FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA or BLA approval, the FDA may impose additional requirements, such as post-marketing studies and/or a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. A REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical study(ies), and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical studies, preclinical studies or manufacturing.

Expedited Review and Accelerated Approval Programs 
 A sponsor may seek approval of its product candidate under programs designed to accelerate FDA’s review and approval of NDAs and BLAs. For example, Fast Track Designation may be granted to a drug intended for treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and data demonstrate its potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. The key benefits of fast track designation are the eligibility for priority review, rolling review (submission of portions of an application before the complete marketing application is submitted), and accelerated approval, if relevant criteria are met. The FDA may grant the NDA or BLA a priority review designation, which sets the target date for FDA action on the application at six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review is granted where there is evidence that the proposed product would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a serious condition. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval. 
 The FDA may approve an NDA or BLA under the accelerated approval program if the drug treats a serious condition, provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies, and demonstrates an effect on either (1) a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or (2) on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Post-marketing studies or completion of ongoing studies after marketing approval are generally required to verify the drug’s clinical benefit in relationship to the surrogate endpoint or ultimate outcome in relationship to the clinical benefit. 
 In addition, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, established the new Breakthrough Therapy designation. A sponsor may seek FDA designation of its product candidate as a breakthrough therapy if the drug is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. If a drug is designated as breakthrough therapy, FDA will provide more intensive guidance on the drug development program and expedite its review.
 Orphan Designation and Exclusivity 
 The FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States. 
 Orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical study costs, tax advantages, and user-fee waivers. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. In addition, the first NDA or BLA applicant to receive orphan drug designation for a particular drug is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years in the United States, except in limited circumstances. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. 
 Pediatric Studies and Exclusivity 
 NDAs and BLAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of an investigational new drug product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric populations in order to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults or full or partial waivers if certain criteria are met. Discussions about pediatric development plans can be discussed with the FDA at any time, but usually occur any time between the end-of-Phase II meeting and submission of the NDA or BLA. Unless otherwise required by regulation, the requirements for pediatric data do not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. 
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent exclusivity in the United States that may be granted if certain FDA requirements are met, such as FDA’s determination that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits, and the applicant agrees to perform and report on FDA-requested studies within a certain time frame. Pediatric exclusivity adds a period of six months of exclusivity to the end of all existing marketing exclusivity and patents held by the sponsor for that active moiety. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot accept or approve another application relying on the NDA or BLA sponsor’s data. 
 Biosimilars and Exclusivity 
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, or Affordable Care Act, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCI Act, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be similar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product.  
 21


A reference biologic is granted twelve years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product. The first biologic product submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product has exclusivity against other biologics submitting under the abbreviated approval pathway for the lesser of (i) one year after the first commercial marketing, (ii) eighteen months after approval if there is no legal challenge, (iii) eighteen months after the resolution in the applicant’s favor of a lawsuit challenging the biologics’ patents if an application has been submitted, or (iv) 42 months after the application has been approved if a lawsuit is ongoing within the 42-month period. 
 Abbreviated New Drug Applications for Generic Drugs and New Chemical Entity Exclusivity
 The Hatch-Waxman Amendments authorized the FDA to approve generic drugs that are bioequivalent (i.e. identical) to previously approved branded drugs. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, to the FDA. In support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference listed drug, or RLD. 
 Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is bioequivalent to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, quality and performance characteristics, the strength of the drug, and intended use. 
 The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity. In cases where such exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval. The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if an NDA or supplement includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication. 
 When an ANDA applicant files its application with the FDA, it must certify, among other things, that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable, which is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicates that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months after the receipt of the Paragraph IV notice, expiration of the patent, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant. 
 Patent Term Restoration 
 Some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA or BLA, plus the time between the submission date and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. Thus, for each approved product, we may apply for restoration of patent term for one of our related owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond the original expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical studies and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA or BLA. 
European Union Regulation 
 In the EU, to obtain regulatory approval of an investigational medicinal product, we must submit an MAA. The content of the MAA is similar to that of an NDA or BLA filed in the United States, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements. 
 22


Authorization Procedures
 Medicines can be authorized by using the centralized authorization procedure or national authorization procedures. The centralized authorization procedure results in a single marketing authorization issued by the EMA that is valid across the European Economic Area, or EEA, which is comprised of the 28 member states of the EU plus Norway, Iceland, and Lichtenstein. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human medicines that are derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering; contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions; and officially designated orphan medicines. Medicines that fall outside the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure have three routes to authorization: (i) they can be authorized under the centralized procedure if they concern a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if their authorization would be in the interest of public health; (ii) they can be authorized under a decentralized procedure where an applicant applies for simultaneous authorization in more than one EU country; or (iii) they can be authorized in a EU member state in accordance with that state’s national procedures and then be authorized in other EU countries by a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization (mutual recognition procedure). 
 A Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, and/or a request for waiver or deferral, is required for submission prior to submitting a marketing authorization application. A PIP describes, among other things, proposed pediatric studies and their timing relative to clinical studies in adults and an MAA must comply with the PIP to be validated.
 MAA Review and Approval Timeframe and Accelerated Assessment 
 Under the centralized procedure in the EU, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application that has been validated is 210 days, excluding time taken by an applicant to respond to questions. A favorable opinion on the application by the CHMP will typically result in the granting of the marketing authorization within 67 days of receipt of the opinion. Generally, the entire review process takes approximately one year. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. In this circumstance, EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days, excluding time taken by an applicant to respond to questions. 
Exceptional Circumstances/Conditional Approval 
 Orphan drugs or drugs with unmet medical needs may be eligible for EU approval under exceptional circumstances or with conditional approval. Approval under exceptional circumstances is applicable to orphan products and is used when an applicant is unable to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety under normal conditions of use because the indication for which the product is intended is encountered so rarely that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to provide comprehensive evidence, when the present state of scientific knowledge does not allow comprehensive information to be provided, or when it is medically unethical to collect such information. Conditional marketing authorization is applicable to orphan medicinal products, medicinal products for seriously debilitating or life-threatening diseases, or medicinal products to be used in emergency situations in response to recognized public threats. Conditional marketing authorization can be granted on the basis of less complete data than is normally required in order to meet unmet medical needs and in the interest of public health, provided the risk-benefit balance is positive, it is likely that the applicant will be able to provide the comprehensive clinical data, and unmet medical needs will be fulfilled. Conditional marketing authorization is subject to certain specific obligations to be reviewed annually. 
 PRIME Program
 PRIME is a program launched by the EMA to enhance support for the development of medicines that target an unmet medical need. The program focuses on medicines that may offer a major therapeutic advantage over existing treatments, or benefit patients without treatment options. These medicines are considered priority medicines by EMA. To be accepted for PRIME, a medicine has to show its potential to benefit patients with unmet medical needs based on early clinical data. Through PRIME, the EMA offers early and proactive support to medicine developers to optimize development plans and the generation of robust data on a medicine’s benefits and risks and enables accelerated assessment of medicines applications.
 23


Orphan Designation and Exclusivity
 As in the United States, we may apply for designation of a product as an orphan drug for the treatment of a specific indication in the EU before the application for marketing authorization is made. The EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, or COMP, grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the EU Community and for which no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment has been authorized (or the product would be a significant benefit to those affected). Additionally, designation is granted for products intended for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the EU would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the medicinal product. Orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and 10 years of market exclusivity is granted following medicinal product approval. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
New Chemical Entity Exclusivity 
 In the EU, new chemical entities, sometimes referred to as new active substances, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. This data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the EU from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic (abbreviated) application for eight years, after which generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but not approved for two years. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to regulatory approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the regulatory authorities, including, among other things, requirements relating to formal commitments for post approval clinical trials and studies, manufacturing, recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior regulatory authority review and approval. 
 Drug manufacturers are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by regulatory authorities and country or state agencies for compliance with GMP and other requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior regulatory approval before being implemented. Regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from GMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with GMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. 
 Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 
 In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved drugs for a particular indication. Moreover, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. 
 In the European Community, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed to by the government. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.

Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 
 If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we may be subject to various laws targeting, among other things, fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing, and education programs. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include: 

• | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended, which prohibits executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters and imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the 21st Century Cures Act, or the Cures Act, signed into law in December 2016, which introduced a wide range of reforms, such as broadening the types of data required to support drug approval, extending protections for generic competition, accelerating approval of breakthrough therapies, expanding the orphan drug product program, requiring disclosures about compassionate care programs, and clarifying how manufacturers communicate about their products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal transparency laws, including the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, that requires drug manufacturers to disclose payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as transparency laws, anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers, and privacy and security of health information laws.

Additional Regulation 
 The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), to which we are subject, prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. Similar laws exist in other countries, such as the United Kingdom, that restrict improper payments to public and private parties. Many countries have laws prohibiting these types of payments within the respective country. In addition to these anti-corruption laws, we are subject to import and export control laws, tariffs, trade barriers, economic sanctions and regulatory limitations on our ability to operate in certain foreign markets.
 In addition, federal, state and foreign government bodies and agencies have adopted, are considering adopting, or may adopt laws and regulations regarding the collection, use, storage and disclosure of personally identifiable information or other information treated as confidential obtained from consumers and individuals.
 We are also subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other present and potential federal, state or local regulations. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological and chemical substances used in, and waste generated by, our operations.
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2016, we had 376 full-time employees. None of our employees is represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. 
Research and Development 
 We recognized $183.2 million, $114.7 million, and $46.0 million in research and development expense in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
