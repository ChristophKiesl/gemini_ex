ITEM 1. Business
Overview
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of programmed cellular immunotherapies for patients with cancer. We are developing first-in-class cell therapy product candidates based on a simple notion: we believe that better cell therapies start with better cells. 
 To create better cell therapies, we use a therapeutic approach that we generally refer to as cell programming. For certain of our product candidates, we use pharmacologic modulators, such as small molecules, to enhance the biological properties and therapeutic function of allogeneic, or healthy donor-sourced, cells ex vivo before our product candidates are administered to a patient. In other cases, we use human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to generate a clonal master iPSC line having preferred biological properties, and we direct the fate of the clonal master iPSC line to create our cell therapy product candidate. Analogous to master cell lines used to manufacture biopharmaceutical drug products such as monoclonal antibodies, we believe clonal master iPSC lines can be used as a renewable source for manufacturing cell therapy products which are well-defined and uniform in composition, can be repeatedly mass produced at significant scale in a cost-effective manner, and can be delivered off-the-shelf to treat many patients.
 Utilizing these therapeutic approaches, we program cells of the blood and immune system and are advancing a pipeline of programmed cellular immunotherapies, including off-the-shelf natural killer (NK) and T-cell product candidates derived from clonal master iPSC lines for the treatment of cancer. The following table summarizes our programmed cellular immunotherapies currently under development:

Our Approach
 The use of human cells as therapeutic entities has disease-transforming potential, and compelling evidence of medical benefit for cell therapy exists across a broad spectrum of severe, life-threatening diseases. One of the most successful and widespread applications of cell therapy is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), with over 60,000 procedures performed worldwide on an annual basis. HSCT holds curative potential for patients afflicted with hematologic malignancies, such as leukemia and lymphoma, and with rare genetic disorders, such as hemoglobinopathies, inherited metabolic disorders and immune deficiencies.
 Building upon the success of HSCT, the clinical investigation of cell-based cancer immunotherapy is rapidly expanding. One particular form of cell-based cancer immunotherapy, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy, has recently emerged as a revolutionary and potentially curative therapy for patients with certain hematologic malignancies, including refractory cancers. In fact, in 2017, two CAR T-cell therapies were approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of relapsed / refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and relapsed / refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).
 Cell-based cancer immunotherapies undergoing clinical investigation today most often rely on the use of autologous, or a patient’s own, cells. The requirement to source, engineer, expand and deliver cells patient-by-patient is logistically complex, resource intensive and expensive, and can result in significant batch-to-batch variability in product identity, purity and potency as well as in manufacturing failures. Significant hurdles remain to ensure that cell-based cancer immunotherapies can be consistently manufactured and reliably delivered, in a cost-effective manner and at the scale necessary, to support broad patient access and wide-spread commercialization.
 Rather than rely on the use of a patient’s own cells, we seek to use allogeneic, or healthy donor-sourced, cells and clonal master iPSC lines to manufacture, develop and commercialize first-in-class cellular immunotherapies. We believe our approach has the potential to improve cell product consistency and potency, reduce manufacturing costs, shorten time to treatment and reach more patients.
 Our Strategy
 The key pillars of our strategy are to:
  
• | Exploit our leadership position in iPSC technology to develop and commercialize universal, off-the-shelf cell products for the treatment of cancer. Human iPSCs, with their unique dual capacity to be indefinitely expanded and differentiated in culture into any type of cell in the body, hold revolutionary potential for creating better cell therapies. The groundbreaking discovery that fully differentiated human cells can be induced to a pluripotent state through the expression of certain genes was recognized with the 2012 Nobel Prize in Science and Medicine. We believe iPSCs can be used to overcome key limitations inherent in many of the cell therapy product candidates undergoing development today, including the requirement to source, isolate, engineer and expand cells from an individual patient or healthy donor with each batch of production. These batch-to-batch manufacturing requirements are logistically complex and expensive, and can result in variable cell product identity, purity and potency as well as manufacturing failures.

 We are applying our expertise in iPSC biology to genetically engineer, isolate and select single-cell iPSCs for clonal expansion, characterization and cryopreservation as clonal master iPSC lines. Analogous to master cell lines used to manufacture biopharmaceutical drug products such as monoclonal antibodies, we believe clonal master iPSC lines can be made and used as a renewable source for manufacturing cell therapy products that are well-defined and uniform in composition, can be repeatedly mass produced at significant scale in a cost-effective manner, and can be delivered off-the-shelf to treat many patients. 
 We have amassed significant expertise in the manufacture of natural killer (NK) cells and T cells from clonal master iPSC lines. Our expertise includes: generating, engineering, isolating and characterizing single-cell iPSC clones; creating and cryopreserving clonal master iPSC lines; differentiating these clonal master cell lines to produce NK cells and T cells; and regulatory affairs experience to enable clinical investigation of iPSC-derived cell products. We believe our iPSC-derived NK cell and T-cell product candidates have the potential to be administered in multi-dose, multi-cycle treatment regimens, including in combination with other cancer treatments, to drive deeper and more durable responses.

• | Forge collaborations with leading researchers and top medical centers to accelerate development of and rapidly translate our iPSC-derived cell product candidates into first-in-human clinical trials. The research and development of iPSC-derived cell product candidates requires an exceptional team of people and scientific, manufacturing and clinical expertise across a range of disciplines. We have and will continue to seek collaborations with leading researchers, investigators and top medical centers for the research, development, manufacture and clinical translation of our iPSC-derived cell product candidates. Among our collaborations is a partnership with the University of Minnesota, led by Dr. Jeffrey S. Miller, a renowned NK cell biologist and clinical investigator, to support the development of our iPSC-derived NK cell product candidates, including FT500 and FT516. FT500 is the first-ever iPSC-derived cell therapy to be administered to patients in the United States (U.S.), and FT516 is the first-ever engineered iPSC-derived cell therapy administered to patients in the world. We also have a partnership with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, led by Dr. Michel Sadelain, a renowned T-cell biologist and a recognized founder of CAR T-cell therapy, to support the development of our iPSC-derived CAR T-cell product candidates, including FT819. We believe this approach to research and development will maximize our potential to successfully build our iPSC product platform, accelerate the clinical translation and clinical investigation of our iPSC-derived cell product candidates, and efficiently establish clinical proof-of-concept for our iPSC-derived cell product candidates.

• | Selectively share our iPSC product platform with industry-leading strategic partners for the development of iPSC-derived cell therapies. The research, development and clinical investigation of cell therapies for the treatment of human diseases is rapidly expanding. We believe we are uniquely positioned as an expert partner of choice for industry-leading developers seeking to develop iPSC-derived cell therapies for the treatment of human diseases, including cancer. For example, we are collaborating with Ono Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. (Ono) to develop and commercialize off-the-shelf, iPSC-derived CAR T-cells for the treatment of certain solid tumors, and we are collaborating with Janssen Biotech, Inc. (Janssen), part of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, to develop and commercialize off-the-shelf, iPSC-derived CAR NK cell and CAR T-cell product candidates for the treatment of certain hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. Since iPSCs have the unique capacity to be genetically engineered, indefinitely expanded and differentiated in culture into any type of cell in the body, we believe there is significant opportunity to broadly exploit our industry-leading iPSC product platform and intellectual property position in other disease areas beyond cancer. We will continue to seek partnerships with institutions and companies for the research, development and commercialization of iPSC-derived cell therapies for the treatment of human diseases.

• | Efficiently develop and commercialize first-in-class cellular immunotherapies for severe, life-threatening diseases where treatment options are limited. We are clinically developing first-in-class cellular immunotherapies to improve the lives of patients with severe, life-threatening diseases, where the unmet need is significant and where regulatory agencies offer efficient and expedited development and review programs. For example, we are developing our product candidate ProTmune as a first-in-class hematopoietic cell graft for the prevention of life-threatening complications, including graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), in patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT. GvHD is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT, and there are currently no therapies approved by the FDA for the prevention of GvHD. The FDA has granted Fast Track designation, and the FDA and the European Commission have granted Orphan Drug Designation and Orphan Medicinal Product Designation, respectively, for ProTmune. Due to high incidences of morbidity and mortality and the rare disease nature of many of our target indications, we believe clinical trials that we conduct will generally require relatively small numbers of subjects and that our development path to approval may be efficient.

Our Off-the-shelf, iPSC-derived Cellular Immunotherapy Pipeline
 NK cells have an innate ability to rapidly seek and destroy abnormal cells, such as cancer or virally-infected cells, and represent one of the body’s first lines of immunological defense. NK cells have the unique ability to selectively identify and destroy abnormal cells through multiple mechanisms while leaving normal healthy cells unharmed. These cytotoxic mechanisms include: direct innate killing by binding to stress ligands expressed by abnormal cells and releasing toxic granules; indirect killing by producing and releasing proinflammatory and chemotactic cytokines that play a pivotal role in orchestrating the adaptive immune response; and antibody-mediated targeted killing by binding to and enhancing the cancer-killing effect of endogenous and therapeutic antibodies through a process known as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC).
 7


T cells, or T-lymphocytes, play a critical role in adaptive immunity and are distinguished from other cells of the immune system by the presence of a T-cell receptor (TCR) on their surface. TCRs are generated by DNA rearrangement and positively selected for their capacity to engage host major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. The majority of T cells, termed alpha beta T cells (αβ T cells), rearrange their alpha and beta chains on the TCR, which confers specificity and enables T cells to recognize non-self molecules, known as non-self antigens, expressed on the surface of transformed or foreign cells. Antigens inside a cell are bound to, and are routinely brought to the surface of a cell, by MHC class I molecules. Upon antigen recognition, T cells bind to the MHC-antigen complex, become activated and destroy the targeted cell. Unlike NK cells, T cells are limited by antigen-specific binding of their TCR in order to induce cellular cytotoxicity.
 We are developing off-the-shelf, iPSC-derived NK cell and T-cell cancer immunotherapies, including cell product candidates intended to synergize with checkpoint inhibitor and monoclonal antibody therapies and to target tumor-associated antigens.
 FT500: iPSC-derived NK Cell Product Candidate for Advanced Solid Tumors
 Therapies that block inhibitory immunological signaling pathways have transformed the oncology landscape. For example, the use of monoclonal antibodies known as checkpoint inhibitors, which bind immune checkpoint proteins and block pathways that suppress T cells, has resulted in long term remissions in multiple tumor indications. Unfortunately, more than 60% of patients treated with checkpoint inhibitors will not respond or will relapse. As a result, there is significant unmet need for novel therapeutic approaches to overcome resistance to checkpoint inhibitors.
 One common mechanism of resistance to checkpoint inhibitor therapy arises through point mutations, deletions or loss of heterozygosity in beta-2-microglobulin (B2M), an essential component of MHC class I antigen presentation. A recent longitudinal analysis in a cohort of patients treated with checkpoint inhibitor therapy identified B2M expression defects in approximately 30% of patients with progressing disease. In fact, loss of heterozygosity in B2M was found to be enriched three-fold in non-responders (~30%) vs. responders (~10%) and was associated with poor overall survival. Additionally, complete loss of B2M expression was found only in non-responders. These findings suggest that defects in B2M expression can contribute to tumor evasion and disease progression.
 One potential strategy to overcome resistance to checkpoint inhibitor therapy, especially in patients whose tumors harbor defects in B2M expression, is through the administration of allogeneic NK cells. NK cells have the inherent capability to recognize and directly kill cells that lack MHC class I antigen presentation. In addition to direct cytotoxicity, NK cells can also secrete proinflammatory and chemotactic cytokines, which can induce tumor-resident T cells to re-engage as well as recruit T cells to the tumor site. As such, allogeneic NK cell therapy may represent a novel therapeutic strategy to overcome resistance to checkpoint inhibitor therapy in certain patients by directly killing tumor cells and by potentiating an adaptive immune response. 
 FT500 is an investigational off-the-shelf NK cell cancer immunotherapy derived from a clonal master iPSC line. To our knowledge, FT500 is the first-ever iPSC-derived cell therapy cleared for clinical investigation in the United States. We are developing FT500 for the treatment of advanced solid tumors.
 FT500 is being studied in an ongoing, multi-center Phase 1 clinical trial. The trial is designed to assess the safety and determine the maximum dose of FT500 in adult patients with advanced solid tumors. The trial includes two treatment regimens: FT500 as a monotherapy in patients that are candidates for salvage therapy (Regimen A); and, in patients who have previously failed or progressed on checkpoint inhibitor therapy, FT500 in combination with the checkpoint inhibitor on which the patient failed or progressed (Regimen B). FT500 is administered in three once-weekly doses following outpatient lympho-conditioning. For those patients that are clinically stable at Day 29, an additional treatment course of three once-weekly doses may be administered.
 At the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) annual meeting in November 2020, we reported clinical data from the dose-escalation stage of the Phase 1 clinical trial as of an October 13, 2020 cutoff date. Fifteen heavily pre-treated patients, ten of whom were refractory to their last prior therapy, were administered up to six doses of FT500. In Regimen A, three patients were treated in the first dose cohort of 100 million cells per dose and six patients were treated in the second dose cohort of 300 million cells per dose; in Regimen B, three patients were treated in the first dose cohort of 100 million cells per dose, and three patients were treated in the second dose cohort of 300 million cells per dose, in combination with checkpoint inhibitor therapy. No dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), no FT500-related serious adverse events (SAEs) or Grade ≥ 3 adverse events (AEs), and no events of any grade of cytokine release syndrome (CRS), immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS), or GvHD were reported by investigators. Eleven patients had a best overall response of stable disease.

In addition to our clinical assessment, we also evaluated patients’ immune response to FT500 to assess the potential for both T-cell and B-cell mediated immunogenicity. The T-cell compartment of fourteen patients was evaluated for T-cell mediated host-versus-product (FT500) allo-reactivity. A TCR repertoire analysis conducted at multiple time points following treatment with FT500 was not indicative of a robust allo-reactive T-cell response against FT500. In addition, the antibody repertoire of 15 patients was analyzed for targeting of the six HLA class I types expressed by FT500 to assess for B-cell mediated host-versus-product (FT500) allo-reactivity. Among the 15 patients, a single FT500 anti-HLA antibody with a mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) level of ≥ 5,000 was detected in two patients, suggesting that a robust B-cell response against FT500 was not evident. As a point of reference, in patients undergoing haplo-identical hematopoietic stem cell transplant, an MFI level ≥ 5,000 has been correlated with a 5-fold increase in risk of graft rejection.
 We are currently enrolling the dose-expansion stage of the FT500 Phase 1 clinical trial for patients with non-small cell lung cancer or classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma who are refractory to, or have relapsed on, checkpoint inhibitor therapy. We intend to treat up to 15 patients, administering up to six doses of FT500 at 300 million cells per dose, each with IL-2 cytokine support, in combination with the checkpoint inhibitor on which the patient failed or relapsed.
 FT516: iPSC-derived, hnCD16 Engineered NK Cell Product Candidate 
 NK cells play a major role in the anti-tumor activity of certain tumor-targeting antibodies. NK cells express CD16, an activating receptor that binds to the Fc domain of IgG antibodies. Once activated through CD16, NK cells are able to destroy antibody-coated tumor cells and secrete cytokines, such as interferon gamma, to potentiate an adaptive immune response. This mechanism of action, referred to as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), is believed to be important for the treatment of a wide range of cancers.
 CD16 consists of two genomic variants, 158V and 158F, that elicit high or low binding affinity, respectively, to the Fc domain of IgG antibodies. Numerous clinical studies with FDA-approved tumor-targeting antibodies, including rituximab (FDA-approved for certain cancers of the blood and lymph system), trastuzumab (FDA-approved for certain breast and gastric cancers) and cetuximab (FDA-approved for certain head and neck, non-small cell lung and colorectal cancers), have demonstrated that patients homozygous for the 158V variant, which is present in only about 15% of patients, have improved clinical outcomes. In addition, the expression of CD16 on NK cells has been shown to undergo considerable down-regulation in cancer patients, which can significantly limit anti-tumor activity.
 FT516 is an investigational off-the-shelf NK cell cancer immunotherapy derived from a clonal master iPSC line engineered to express a novel CD16 (hnCD16) Fc receptor. Our novel CD16 Fc receptor incorporates two unique features designed to augment the anti-tumor activity of FT516: a high-affinity homozygous 158V variant to promote high binding affinity and a modification to block its cleavage and down-regulation upon NK cell activation. 
 In preclinical studies, we have shown that FT516 exhibits potent and persistent anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo in multiple tumor cell recognition and killing assays:
  
• | FT516, as compared to conventional NK cells sourced from peripheral blood and from cord blood, exhibits superior direct killing in vitro in combination with rituximab in a human lymphoma cell line killing assay (positive for CD20) and in combination with each of trastuzumab and cetuximab in a human ovarian cancer cell line killing assay (positive for both HER2 and EGFR);

• | FT516 in combination with rituximab shows a dose-dependent killing response in vitro in a CD20+ human lymphoblast-derived B-lymphocyte cell line killing assay;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FT516 in combination with trastuzumab, as compared to trastuzumab alone, augments anti-tumor activity in vivo in a HER2+ ovarian cancer model, where the anti-tumor activity at Week 6 of FT516 plus trastuzumab was durable with no tumor detectable by imaging in 80% of the mice as compared to trastuzumab alone where all mice displayed tumor burden; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FT516 in combination with rituximab, as compared to rituximab alone or rituximab in combination with conventional NK cells sourced from peripheral blood, augments anti-tumor activity and promotes prolonged survival in vivo in a human lymphoma cancer model, where the median survival following treatment with FT516 plus rituximab exceeded 100 days as compared to approximately 35 days for rituximab alone and for rituximab in combination with conventional NK cells sourced from peripheral blood.

Hematologic Malignancies
 FT516 is being studied in an ongoing, multi-center Phase 1 clinical trial. To our knowledge, FT516 is the first-ever engineered iPSC-derived cell therapy cleared for clinical investigation in the United States. The Phase 1 study is designed to assess the safety and determine the maximum dose of FT516 in adult patients with certain hematologic malignancies. The trial includes two treatment regimens: FT516 as a monotherapy in patients with relapsed / refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with three separate dose cohorts (90 million cells per dose; 300 million cells per dose; 900 million cells per dose) (Regimen A); and FT516 in combination with CD20-targeted monoclonal antibody therapy in patients with advanced B-cell lymphoma (BCL) who have previously failed or progressed on CD20-targeted monoclonal antibody therapy with four separate dose cohorts (30 million cells per dose; 90 million cells per dose; 300 million cells per dose; 900 million cells per dose) (Regimen B). The treatment schedule consists of three once-weekly doses of FT516, each with IL-2 cytokine support, following outpatient lympho-conditioning. For those patients that are clinically stable at Day 29, a second treatment cycle may be administered. 
 Phase 1 Clinical Data in AML. We have reported interim Phase 1 clinical data on two patients in Regimen A in the first dose cohort (90 million cells per dose) as of a May 18, 2020 cutoff date. Each patient was previously treated with three lines of therapy and was refractory to the most recent line of therapy. No DLTs, no FT516-related SAEs, and no events of any grade of CRS, ICANS, or GvHD were reported by investigators. Following completion of the first 30-day cycle of FT516, the first patient showed no morphologic evidence of leukemia by bone marrow biopsy and had evidence of neutrophil recovery. The protocol-defined response assessment following completion of the second 30-day cycle of FT516 showed stable disease per ELN 2017 criteria in both patients. Dose escalation is currently ongoing in Regimen A.
 Phase 1 Clinical Data in BCL. We have reported interim Phase 1 clinical data on six patients in Regimen B, including four patients in the second (90 million cells per dose) and third (300 million cells per dose) dose cohorts as of a November 16, 2020 cutoff date. Three of these four patients achieved an objective response, including two complete responses, as assessed by PET-CT scan per Lugano 2014 criteria. No DLTs, no FT516-related SAEs, and no events of any grade of CRS, ICANS, or GvHD were reported by investigators. Additionally, the multi-dose, two-cycle treatment schedule was well-tolerated by each of the four patients, with no FT516-related Grade ≥ 3 AEs reported by investigators. In the first dose cohort (30 million cells per dose), each patient showed progressive disease as assessed by PET-CT scan per Lugano 2014 criteria. Dose escalation is currently ongoing in Regimen B.
 Solid Tumors
 We are also assessing the safety and maximum dose of FT516 in patients with advanced solid tumors. In December 2019, the FDA allowed our second IND application for the clinical investigation of FT516 in combination with monoclonal antibody therapy, including PDL1-, PD-1, EGFR- and HER2-targeted therapeutic antibodies, across a broad range of advanced solid tumors. In September 2020, we initiated a multi-center Phase 1 clinical trial of FT516 in combination with avelumab, an anti-PDL1 checkpoint inhibitor therapy, in patients with advanced solid tumors. The treatment schedule consists of three once-weekly doses of FT516, each with IL-2 cytokine support, following outpatient lympho-conditioning for up to two 30-day cycles. Dose escalation is currently ongoing. 
 In April 2020, the FDA allowed a third IND application for the clinical investigation of FT516 in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer. The Phase 1 clinical trial, which is sponsored and managed by investigators from the Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, is designed to assess the safety and determine the maximum dose of FT516 as a monotherapy and in combination with enoblituzumab, an Fc-optimized monoclonal antibody that targets B7-H3, which is expressed on ovarian cancer cells. The treatment schedule consists of three once-weekly doses of FT516, each with IL-2 cytokine support, following outpatient lympho-conditioning.
 FT596: iPSC-derived, hnCD16, CAR19, IL15-RF Engineered NK Cell Product Candidate 
 CAR T-cell therapy has recently emerged as a revolutionary and potentially curative therapy for patients with certain hematologic malignancies, including refractory cancers. In 2017, two CAR T-cell therapies were approved by the FDA for the treatment of relapsed / refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and relapsed / refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). While most researchers and clinical investigators continue to focus on the development of autologous or allogeneic CAR T-cell therapies, we are developing CAR NK cell product candidates derived from clonal master engineered iPSC lines as off-the-shelf cancer immunotherapies for the treatment of hematologic malignancies and solid tumors.
 FT596 is an investigational off-the-shelf CAR NK cell cancer immunotherapy derived from a clonal engineered master iPSC line. FT596 incorporates three anti-tumor functional modalities: a proprietary CAR optimized for NK cell biology that targets B-cell antigen CD19; a novel high-affinity, non-cleavable CD16 (hnCD16) Fc receptor that has been modified to augment antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, enabling targeting of tumor-associated antigens such as CD20; and an IL-15/IL-15 receptor fusion (IL-15RF), a potent cytokine complex that promotes survival, proliferation and trans-activation of NK cells and CD8 T cells. Together, these features are intended to enable multi-antigen targeting, maximize potency and minimize toxicity in treated patients.

In preclinical studies, we have shown that FT596 exhibits potent and persistent anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo in multiple tumor cell recognition and killing assays:
  
• | In a mixed co-culture assay, we have shown increased degranulation (CD107a) and cytokine release (interferon-gamma and TNF-alfa) upon concurrent activation of both the CAR and CD16 receptors in CD19+CD20+ Raji cancer cells with rituximab, as compared to activation of each receptor alone, indicating that dual-antigen engagement may elicit synergistic anti-tumor activity;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In a humanized mouse model of CD19+ lymphoma, FT596 administered as a monotherapy exhibited durable tumor clearance and extended survival in vivo similar to primary CAR T cells; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In a mixed cellular composition cytotoxicity assay comprised of CD19+ and CD19- tumor cells, FT596 combined with rituximab effectively eliminated the heterogeneous population of tumor cells, a result that was not observed with single-antigen targeted CAR19 T cells.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe these preclinical data demonstrate the anti-tumor potency and the unique multi-antigen targeting functionality of FT596, and the product candidate’s potential to effectively overcome CD19 antigen escape.
 FT596 is being studied in an ongoing, multi-center Phase 1 clinical trial for the treatment of relapsed / refractory B-cell malignancies. To our knowledge, FT596 is the first cellular immunotherapy engineered with three active anti-tumor components to be cleared for clinical investigation by the FDA. The Phase 1 study is designed to assess the safety and determine the maximum dose of FT596 in up to 123 adult patients in up to four dose cohorts (30 million cells; 90 million cells; 300 million cells and 900 million cells). The trial includes five treatment regimens: Regimen A1 as a monotherapy for patients with relapsed / refractory B-cell lymphoma (BCL); Regimen B1 in combination with rituximab for patients with relapsed / refractory BCL who have previously failed or progressed on rituximab; Regimen B2 in combination with obinutuzumab for patients with relapsed / refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) who have previously failed or progressed on obinutuzumab; Regimen A2 as a monotherapy for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL); and Regimen B3 in combination with obinutuzumab for patients with relapsed / refractory CLL. FT596 is administered as a single dose following outpatient lympho-conditioning. Dose escalation in the FT596 Phase 1 study is currently ongoing in Regimens A1, B1 and A2. 
 We have reported interim Phase 1 clinical data on two patients as of a September 24, 2020 cutoff date. Each patient was treated in Regimen A1 for relapsed / refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in the first single-dose cohort (30 million cells as a monotherapy). Each patient was previously treated with at least four lines of therapy. The first patient most recently had disease progression following treatment with CD19-targeting CAR T-cell therapy, was treated with a single dose of 30 million cells of FT596 as a monotherapy, and the Day 29 protocol-defined response assessment showed progressive disease. The second patient was most recently refractory to an experimental combination therapy comprised of ex vivo expanded allogeneic NK cells, IL-2, and rituximab, was treated with a single dose of 30 million cells of FT596 as a monotherapy, and the Day 29 protocol-defined response assessment showed partial response as assessed by PET-CT scan per Lugano 2014 criteria. The patient was subsequently treated with a second dose of 30 million cells of FT596 following outpatient lympho-conditioning, which resulted in a deepening response as evidenced by further reduction in both tumor size and metabolic activity as assessed by PET-CT scan per Lugano 2014 criteria. The duration of response was 3.7 months. No DLTs, no FT596-related SAEs, and no events of any grade of CRS, ICANS, or GvHD were reported by investigators in either patient.
 In April 2020, the FDA allowed a second IND application for the clinical investigation of FT596 for the prevention of relapse in patients with BCL who have undergone autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) and are considered high risk for early relapse. The Phase 1 clinical trial, which is sponsored by investigators from the Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, is designed to assess the safety and determine the maximum dose of FT596 in combination with CD20-targeted monoclonal antibody therapy. The ongoing clinical trial is expected to enroll up to 18 patients in up to three dose cohorts (90 million cells; 300 million cells and 900 million cells). FT596 is administered as a single dose with CD20-targeted monoclonal antibody therapy approximately 30 days following HSCT.
 FT538: iPSC-derived, hnCD16, IL15-RF, CD38KO Engineered NK Cell Product Candidate 
 Multiple myeloma is a hematologic malignancy characterized by the proliferation of malignant plasma cells. In multiple myeloma, malignant plasma cells accumulate in the bone marrow and produce abnormal antibodies called M proteins, which can cause kidney damage, bone destruction, and impaired immune function. While multiple approved drugs with novel mechanisms have improved disease management over the past decade, multiple myeloma is rarely curable and a significant number of patients are expected to relapse.
 11


Daratumumab is an IgG1 monoclonal antibody approved by the FDA in November 2015 for the treatment of multiple myeloma. Daratumumab effectively targets CD38, which is expressed on multiple myeloma cells, and induces cell death through multiple mechanisms, including ADCC. However, because CD38 is also expressed on activated NK cells, daratumumab treatment can induce NK cell fratricide, which may impair the effectiveness of ADCC. In addition, NK cell function is often suppressed or absent in patients with multiple myeloma as a result of the cancer itself as well as treatment therapy, further reducing the effectiveness of daratumumab. Collectively, preclinical and clinical observations suggest a potential therapeutic benefit of maintaining NK cell numbers and function to support ADCC in patients with multiple myeloma.
 FT538 is an investigational off-the-shelf NK cell cancer immunotherapy derived from a clonal engineered master iPSC line. FT538 incorporates three functional modifications: a novel high-affinity, non-cleavable CD16 (hnCD16) Fc receptor that has been modified to augment ADCC; an IL-15/IL-15 receptor fusion (IL-15RF), a potent cytokine complex that promotes survival, proliferation and trans-activation of NK cells and CD8 T cells; and the complete elimination of CD38 expression to mitigate the potential for NK cell fratricide. Together, these features are intended to augment ADCC, enhance cell persistence and prevent anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody-induced fratricide.
 FT538 is being studied in an ongoing, multi-center Phase 1 clinical trial designed to assess the safety and determine the maximum dose of FT538 in up to 105 adult patients in up to four dose cohorts (100 million cells per dose; 300 million cells per dose; 1 billion cells per dose; and 1.5 billion cells per dose). The trial includes two treatment regimens: Regimen A as a monotherapy for patients with relapsed / refractory AML; and Regimen B in combination with daratumumab for patients with relapsed / refractory multiple myeloma who have failed at least two lines of therapy. In addition, the clinical protocol allows, at our discretion, the initiation of a third treatment regimen in combination with elotuzumab, an FDA-approved anti-SLAMF7 monoclonal antibody, for patients with relapsed / refractory multiple myeloma who have failed at least two lines of therapy. FT538 is administered in three once-weekly doses following outpatient lympho-conditioning. Dose escalation is currently ongoing in Regimen A. 
 In December 2020, the FDA allowed a second IND application for the clinical investigation of FT538 for the treatment of relapsed / refractory AML. The Phase 1 clinical trial, which is sponsored and managed by investigators from the Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, is designed to assess the safety and determine the maximum dose of FT538 in combination with daratumumab following outpatient lympho-conditioning. FT538 is administered in three once-weekly doses following outpatient lympho-conditioning.
 FT576: iPSC-derived, hnCD16, IL15-RF, CD38-KO, CAR-BCMA Engineered NK Cell Product Candidate
 In addition to CD38 targeting in multiple myeloma, targeting of other tumor-associated antigens expressed on malignant plasma cells has been explored. Of these antigens, the TNF-superfamily member B-cell Maturation Antigen (BCMA) is among the most researched and is under development by multiple groups as a CAR target. Several clinical trials in multiple myeloma have shown promising initial results targeting BCMA with CAR T cells; however, there remains significant opportunity to improve both rates of relapse and treatment of relapsed patients. 
 In August 2019, we entered into a license agreement with the Max Delbrück Center for Molecular Medicine (MDC) under which we were granted certain exclusive rights to intellectual property covering novel humanized CAR constructs that uniquely and specifically bind BCMA. In data published by MDC scientists, anti-BCMA CAR T cells equipped with its unique humanized extracellular antigen-binding domains show higher affinity and greater specificity than other anti-BCMA antigen-binding domains. These differentiated properties conveyed both greater selectivity in recognizing target B cells and more robust killing of target B cells in vitro, including malignant B cells with low expression levels of BCMA. Additionally, in in vivo proof-of-concept studies, MDC scientists demonstrated that anti-BCMA CAR T cells mediated anti-tumor activity in xenotransplant mouse models of multiple myeloma and of mature B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, where BCMA surface expression is up to 4-fold lower as compared to mouse models of multiple myeloma.
 FT576 is an investigational off-the-shelf NK cell cancer immunotherapy derived from a clonal engineered master iPSC line. FT576 incorporates four functional modifications: a proprietary CAR that targets BCMA; a novel high-affinity, non-cleavable CD16 (hnCD16) Fc receptor that has been modified to augment ADCC; an IL-15/IL-15 receptor fusion (IL-15RF), a potent cytokine complex that promotes survival, proliferation and trans-activation of NK cells and CD8 T cells; and the complete elimination of CD38 expression to mitigate the potential for NK cell fratricide. Together, these features are intended to enable multi-antigen targeting of myeloma cells, augment ADCC, enhance cell persistence and prevent anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody-induced fratricide.
 In December 2020, the FDA allowed our IND application for the clinical investigation of FT576 for the treatment of patients with relapsed / refractory multiple myeloma who have failed at least two lines of therapy. To our knowledge, FT576 is the first cellular immunotherapy engineered with four active anti-tumor components to be cleared for clinical investigation by the FDA.
 We plan to conduct GMP manufacture and product release testing of FT576 in the first half of 2021. Subject to manufacture of FT576 in conformance with its release specifications, and submission of any additional non-clinical data requested by the FDA, we plan to initiate a multi-center Phase 1 clinical trial to assess the safety and determine the maximum dose of FT576 following 
 12


outpatient lympho-conditioning in up to 168 adult patients. The trial is expected to include four treatment regimens: Regimen A as a single dose of FT576; Regimen A1 as two fractionated doses of FT576; Regimen B as a single dose of FT576 in combination with daratumumab; and Regimen B1 as two fractionated doses of FT576 in combination with daratumumab.
 FT536: iPSC-derived, hnCD16, IL15-RF, CD38-KO, CAR-MICA/B Engineered NK Cell Product Candidate
 The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I related proteins A (MICA) and B (MICB) are induced by cellular stress, damage or transformation, and the expression of MICA and MICB proteins has been reported for many tumor types. Cytotoxic lymphocytes, such as NK cells and CD8+ T cells, can detect and bind the membrane-distal alpha-1 and -2 domains of MICA/B, activating a potent cytotoxic response. However, advanced cancer cells frequently evade immune cell recognition by proteolytic shedding of these domains. The clinical importance of proteolytic shedding is reflected in the association of high serum concentrations of shed MICA/B with disease progression in many solid tumors. 
 Several recent publications have shown that therapeutic antibodies targeting the membrane-proximal alpha-3 domain strongly inhibited MICA/B shedding, resulting in a substantial increase in the cell surface density of MICA/B and restoration of NK cell-mediated tumor immunity. In addition, a recent publication by scientists from Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) demonstrated that cancers with B2M and JAK1 inactivating mutations resulting in loss of MHC Class I expression can be effectively targeted with alpha-3 domain-specific antibodies to restore NK cell-mediated immunity against solid tumors resistant to cytotoxic T cells. Therapeutic approaches aimed at targeting the alpha-3 domain of MICA/B therefore represent a potentially promising novel strategy to overcome this prominent evasion mechanism as a means of restoring anti-tumor immunity in patients with solid tumors.
 In April 2020, we entered into a license agreement with DFCI under which we were granted certain exclusive rights to intellectual property covering novel antibody fragments that uniquely and specifically bind the alpha-3 domain of MICA/B. We are developing FT536, a preclinical product candidate which incorporates four functional modifications: a proprietary CAR that targets the alpha-3 domain of MICA/B; a novel high-affinity, non-cleavable CD16 (hnCD16) Fc receptor that has been modified to augment ADCC; an IL-15/IL-15 receptor fusion (IL-15RF), a potent cytokine complex that promotes survival, proliferation and trans-activation of NK cells and CD8 T cells; and the complete elimination of CD38 expression to mitigate the potential for NK cell fratricide. We plan to submit an IND application during the second half of 2021 to initiate a multi-center Phase 1 clinical trial of FT536 for the treatment of solid tumors.
 FT819: iPSC-derived, TCR-KO, TRAC-targeted CAR19 Engineered T-Cell Product Candidate 
 In addition to our development of iPSC-derived CAR NK cell product candidates, we are also developing CAR T-cell product candidates derived from clonal master engineered iPSC lines as off-the-shelf cancer immunotherapies for the treatment of hematologic malignancies and solid tumors.
 In September 2016, we announced a multi-year partnership with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center for the development of off-the-shelf engineered T-cell product candidates using clonal master iPSC lines and, in July 2019, we extended the partnership for an additional three years. Research and development activities under the collaboration are being led by Dr. Michel Sadelain, Director of the Center for Cell Engineering and the Stephen and Barbara Friedman Chair at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. 
 In connection with the formation of our partnership with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, we exclusively licensed from Memorial Sloan Kettering foundational intellectual property covering iPSC-derived cellular immunotherapy, including T cells and NK cells derived from iPSCs engineered with CARs, for human therapeutic use. We also secured an exclusive option to exclusively license intellectual property arising from all research and development activities under the partnership. In May 2018, we licensed from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center additional intellectual property covering compositions of novel CAR constructs, including the 1XX CAR construct, and of genetically-engineered CAR T cells, including methods of making these cells using CRISPR for certain targeted gene modifications. Embodiments of this additional intellectual property include preclinical data published by Dr. Sadelain demonstrating that directing a CD19-specific CAR to the T-cell receptor (TCR) alpha constant (TRAC) locus results in uniform CAR expression in human peripheral blood T cells, enhances T-cell potency, and delays effector T-cell differentiation and exhaustion, and that CAR T cells utilizing a novel 1XX CAR signaling domain exhibited enhanced antitumor efficacy, persistence and long-term cytotoxicity as well as a decrease in T-cell exhaustion.
 Under our collaboration with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, we are developing FT819, an off-the-shelf CAR T-cell cancer immunotherapy derived from a clonal engineered master iPSC line with complete elimination of TCR expression and the novel 1XX CAR targeting CD19 inserted into the TRAC locus. Together, these features are intended to induce antigen-specific cytotoxicity, enhance CAR activity through TRAC-regulated expression and completely eliminate TCR expression to mitigate GvHD. 
 13


In preclinical studies, we have shown that FT819 cells:
  
• | display antigen-specific anti-tumor potency in vitro, including cytokine release and targeted cellular cytotoxicity, comparable to peripheral blood CD19-specific CAR T cells;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | do not respond or proliferate against HLA-mismatched (CD19-) peripheral blood mononuclear cells as targets in a mixed lymphocyte reaction, indicating the risk of GvHD is alleviated;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | effectively control tumor progression in vivo comparable to peripheral blood CD19-specific CAR T cells in a preclinical mouse model of acute lymphoblastic leukemia; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | enhance tumor clearance and durable control of leukemia in vivo, as compared to primary CAR19 T cells, in a xenograft mouse model of disseminated lymphoblastic leukemia.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In 2020, the FDA allowed our IND application for the clinical investigation of FT819 for the treatment of certain relapsed / refractory B-cell leukemias and lymphomas. We have completed the first GMP manufacturing campaign for FT819, and we are currently conducting product release testing of FT819 to assess conformance with its release specifications. Subject to successful release of FT819 and submission of any additional non-clinical data requested by the FDA, we plan to initiate a multi-center Phase 1 clinical trial to assess the safety and determine the maximum dose of FT819 following outpatient lympho-conditioning in up to 297 adult patients across three types of B-cell leukemias and lymphomas. Each disease type will enroll independently and assess three treatment regimens: Regimen A as a single dose of FT819; Regimen B as a single dose of FT819 with IL-2 cytokine support; and Regimen C as three fractionated doses of FT819.
 Our Allogeneic Cellular Immunotherapy Pipeline
 ProTmune™
 Allogeneic HSCT has been performed globally for decades with curative intent in patients with a wide range of hematologic malignancies and rare genetic disorders. The procedure involves transferring hematopoietic cells sourced from a healthy donor to a patient following the administration of chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. The biological properties of the various cell populations present in the allogeneic hematopoietic cell graft play an essential role in determining outcomes of HSCT. Donor-sourced CD34+ cells have the unique ability to engraft and reconstitute a new blood and immune system, and donor-sourced immune cells, such as T cells, have an important protective role following HSCT in eradicating residual cancer cells and providing protection against life-threatening infections. The engraftment of donor-sourced CD34+ cells is essential for successful reconstitution, and any delay in, or failure of, engraftment leaves a patient severely immuno-compromised and exposed to exceedingly high risk of early morbidity and mortality. Additionally, while the donor-sourced immune cells impart a critical immunotherapeutic effect, allo-reactive T cells can cause GvHD, a serious complication where donor-sourced T cells recognize antigens on a patient’s cells as foreign and attack the patient’s cells.
 According to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, approximately 30,000 allogeneic HSCT procedures are performed globally each year. Hematopoietic cells for use in allogeneic HSCT can be obtained from multiple donor sources including umbilical cord blood, bone marrow and mobilized peripheral blood (mPB). Approximately 65% of allogeneic HSCT procedures utilize mPB as the donor hematopoietic cell source. While the use of mPB is associated with faster rates of neutrophil engraftment compared to other cell sources like bone marrow and umbilical cord blood, approximately 35-60% of patients undergoing mPB HSCT develop acute GvHD and 70-80% of patients undergoing mPB HSCT experience at least one severe infection within the first 180 days following HSCT. Additionally, approximately 50% of patients undergoing HSCT experience cancer relapse or die within the first two years following HSCT. We believe our cell programming approach has the potential to reduce the three leading causes of morbidity and mortality associated with allogeneic HSCT – namely, GvHD, severe infections and disease relapse – and to improve outcomes in patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT.
 We are developing ProTmune as an investigational programmed cellular immunotherapy for use as a next-generation allogeneic HSCT cell graft. ProTmune is produced by modulating donor-sourced mPB ex vivo with two small molecules, 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 (FT1050) and dexamethasone (FT4145), to enhance the biological properties and therapeutic function of the graft’s cells. The programmed mPB graft is administered to a patient as a one-time intravenous therapy. Based on preclinical data, we believe ProTmune has the potential to suppress the GvHD response and maintain the anti-tumor, or graft-versus-leukemia (GvL), activity of donor T cells. We have demonstrated that FT1050-FT4145 programmed CD4+ and CD8+ T cells of mPB are functionally less allo-reactive in vitro, exhibiting a decrease both in the expression levels of T-cell activation markers, including ICOS and 41BB, and in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and an increase in the production of potent anti-inflammatory cytokines including IL-10.
 14


We are conducting a multi-center Phase 1/2 clinical trial of ProTmune in adult subjects with hematologic malignancies undergoing mPB HSCT following myeloablative conditioning, a clinical trial which we refer to as the PROTECT study. The primary objectives of the PROTECT study are to evaluate safety and tolerability, and to assess the potential of ProTmune to prevent acute GvHD, which is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing HSCT. There are currently no FDA-approved therapies for the prevention of GvHD in patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT, giving rise to a significant unmet medical need. All subjects in the PROTECT study are being followed for a period of two years following HSCT.
 In December 2018, we reported clinical data from the Phase 1 stage of PROTECT. The Phase 1 stage of PROTECT included seven subjects. Underlying hematologic diseases included three subjects with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), three with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and one with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). As of a November 26, 2018 data cut-off, five of seven subjects remained on study with median time on study of 516 days [Day 151 – 616], and the following key safety and efficacy data were reported:
  
• | ProTmune was well-tolerated. There were no events of graft failure and no serious adverse events related to ProTmune reported by investigators.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | There were no reported events of cancer relapse.
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | At Day 100, all seven subjects receiving ProTmune were alive and relapse-free; and three subjects experienced acute GvHD during the first 100 days following HSCT, all of whom responded to standard-of-care steroid treatment. The median time to resolution of the maximum GvHD grade was 7 days [range: 5-8 days].
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | At Day 365, five of seven subjects receiving ProTmune were alive and relapse-free, with non-relapse mortality occurring in two subjects (Subject 1 on Day 228; Subject 3 on Day 151); and three of seven subjects were alive, relapse-free and without moderate-to-severe chronic GvHD.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The ongoing Phase 2 stage of PROTECT is a randomized, controlled and double-blinded clinical trial assessing the safety and efficacy of ProTmune in up to 80 adult subjects with hematologic malignancies undergoing matched unrelated donor HSCT following myeloablative conditioning. In November 2019, we reported that the Phase 2 stage of PROTECT was fully enrolled. Subjects were randomized, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive either ProTmune or a conventional matched unrelated donor mobilized peripheral blood cell graft. The primary efficacy endpoint of PROTECT is cumulative incidence of Grades 2-4 acute GvHD by Day 100 following HSCT, where prospective clinical studies have shown that 35% to 60% of patients undergoing matched unrelated donor transplant experience Grades 2-4 acute GvHD. The secondary efficacy endpoint of PROTECT is the proportion of subjects alive without relapse and without moderate or severe chronic GvHD by Day 365 following HSCT. Additional endpoints, such as rates of cancer relapse, chronic GvHD, non-relapse mortality, and overall survival, are also being assessed. We expect to report clinical results of the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints of PROTECT in the first half of 2021.
 In June 2016, the FDA granted Fast Track designation for ProTmune for the reduction of incidence and severity of acute GvHD in patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT. In September 2016, the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation and, in October 2016, the European Commission granted Orphan Medicinal Product Designation, for ProTmune. The orphan designation granted in each jurisdiction broadly covers subjects undergoing allogeneic HSCT across diseases for which the procedure is performed, including blood cancers and genetic disorders.

 Ono Pharmaceutical
 In September 2018, we entered into a collaboration and option agreement with Ono Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. (Ono) for the joint development and commercialization of two off-the-shelf, iPSC-derived CAR T-cell product candidates. The first off-the-shelf, iPSC-derived CAR T-cell candidate (Candidate 1) targets an antigen expressed on certain lymphoblastic leukemias, and the second off-the-shelf, iPSC-derived CAR T-cell candidate (Candidate 2) targets a novel antigen identified by Ono expressed on certain solid tumors (each a Candidate and, collectively, the Candidates). We granted to Ono, during a specified period of time, an option to obtain an exclusive license under certain intellectual property rights to develop and commercialize (a) Candidate 1 in Asia, where we retained rights for development and commercialization in all other territories of the world and (b) Candidate 2 in all territories of the world, where we retain rights to co-develop and co-commercialize Candidate 2 in the United States and Europe under a joint arrangement with Ono under which we are eligible to share at least 50% of the profits and losses. For each Candidate, the option expires upon the earliest of: (a) the achievement of the pre-defined preclinical milestone, (b) termination by Ono of research and development activities for the Candidate and (c) the date that is the later of (i) four years after the Effective Date and (ii) completion of all applicable activities contemplated under the joint development plan. We maintain worldwide rights of manufacture for Candidates. 
 Under the terms of the agreement, Ono paid us an upfront, non-refundable and non-creditable payment of $10.0 million in connection with entering into the agreement. Additionally, as consideration for our conduct of research and preclinical development under a joint development plan, Ono pays us annual research and development fees set forth in the annual budget included in the joint development plan, which fees are estimated to be $20.0 million in aggregate over the course of the joint development plan. 
 In December 2020, we entered into a letter agreement with Ono pursuant to which Ono nominated and delivered to us proprietary antigen binding domains targeting an antigen expressed on certain solid tumors for incorporation into Candidate 2. In connection with such nomination and delivery, Ono paid us a milestone fee of $10.0 million for further research and development of Candidate 2. In addition, Ono terminated further development with respect to Candidate 1, and we retain all rights to research, develop and commercialize Candidate 1 throughout the world without any obligation to Ono.
 Ono has agreed to pay us up to an additional $20.0 million, subject to the exercise by Ono of its option to develop and commercialize Candidate 2. Subject to Ono’s exercise of the option and to the achievement of certain clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones with respect to Candidate 2 in specified territories, we are entitled to receive an aggregate of up to $885.0 million in milestone payments for Candidate 2, with the applicable milestone payments for the United States and Europe subject to reduction by 50% if we elect to co-develop and co-commercialize Candidate 2 as described above. We are also eligible to receive tiered royalties ranging from the mid-single digits to the low-double digits based on annual net sales by Ono of Candidate 2 in specified territories, with such royalties subject to certain reductions.

The agreement will expire on a Candidate-by-Candidate and country-by-country basis upon the expiration of the applicable royalty term, or in its entirety upon the expiration of all applicable payment obligations under the agreement.
 Our Intellectual Property
 Overview
 We seek to protect our product candidates and our cell programming technology through a variety of methods, including seeking and maintaining patents intended to cover our products and compositions, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture, our platform technologies and any other inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business. We seek to obtain domestic and international patent protection and, in addition to filing and prosecuting patent applications in the United States, we typically file counterpart patent applications in additional countries where we believe such foreign filing is likely to be beneficial, including Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia and China. We continually assess and refine our intellectual property strategy in order to best fortify our position, and file additional patent applications when our intellectual property strategy warrants such filings. We also rely on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. We have entered into exclusive license agreements with various academic and research institutions to obtain the rights to use certain patents for the development and commercialization of our product candidates.
 As of February 9, 2021, our intellectual property portfolio is composed of over 350 issued patents and 150 patent applications that we license from academic and research institutions, and over 250 issued patents or pending patent applications that we own. These patents and patent applications generally provide us with the rights to develop our product candidates in the United States and worldwide. This portfolio covers compositions of programmed cellular immunotherapies, our cell programming approach for enhancing the therapeutic function of cells ex vivo, and our platform for industrial-scale iPSC generation and engineering. We believe that we have a significant intellectual property position and substantial know-how relating to the programming of hematopoietic and immune cells and to the derivation, genetic engineering, and differentiation of iPSCs.
 We cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our owned or licensed pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications we may own or license in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents we may own or license in the future will be useful in protecting our technology. Please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property” for additional information on the risks associated with our intellectual property strategy and portfolio.
 Intellectual Property Relating to iPSC Technology and Platform
 As of February 9, 2021, we own over 20 patent families directed to programming the fate of somatic cells ex vivo, including patent applications pending in the U.S. and internationally related to our platform for industrial-scale iPSC generation and applications related to differentiation of iPSCs into specialized cells with therapeutic potential. These patent applications cover our proprietary small molecule-enhanced iPSC platform, including novel reprogramming factors and methods of reprogramming to obtain iPSCs. Our intellectual property portfolio also includes gene editing compositions and methods of genetic engineering, as well as methods of directing the fate of cells to obtain homogenous cell populations in the hematopoietic lineage, including CD34+ cells, T cells and NK cells. Our proprietary intellectual property enables highly-efficient iPSC derivation, selection, engineering, and clonal expansion while maintaining genomic stability. Any U.S. patents issued from these patent applications will have statutory expiration dates ranging from 2031 to 2041.
 Additionally, we have licensed from the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research a portfolio of four patent families including issued patents and pending applications broadly applicable to the reprogramming of somatic cells. Our license is exclusive in commercial fields, including for drug discovery and therapeutic purposes. This portfolio covers the generation of human iPSCs from somatic cells and, as of February 9, 2021, includes 16 issued U.S. patents (including U.S. Patents 8,071,369, 7,682,828 and 9,497,943) claiming compositions used in the reprogramming of mammalian somatic cells to a less differentiated state (including to a pluripotent state), and methods of making a cell more susceptible to reprogramming. Specifically, the portfolio includes a composition of matter patent issued in the United States covering a cellular composition comprising a somatic cell having an exogenous nucleic acid that encodes an OCT4 protein. OCT4 is the key pluripotency gene most commonly required for the generation of iPSCs. These issued patents and any U.S. patents that may issue from these pending patent applications will have statutory expiration dates ranging from 2024 to 2029.
 17


We also have exclusive licenses from The Scripps Research Institute to a portfolio of seven patent families relating to compositions and methods for reprogramming mammalian somatic cells, which covers non-genetic and viral-free reprogramming mechanisms, including the use of various small molecule classes and compounds and the introduction of cell-penetrating proteins to reprogram mammalian somatic cells. This portfolio includes issued U.S. patents (including U.S. Patents 8,044,201 and 8,691,573) that provide composition of matter protection for a class of small molecules, including thiazovivin, that is critical for inducing the generation, and maintaining the pluripotency, of iPSCs, and compositions and methods of using the small molecule. Any issued U.S. patents and any U.S. patents that may issue from patent applications pending in this portfolio will have statutory expiration dates ranging from 2026 to 2031.
 We also have exclusively licensed from the J. David Gladstone Institutes (Gladstone) intellectual property covering the generation of iPSCs using CRISPR-mediated gene activation. This approach for inducing pluripotency uses CRISPR to directly target a specific location of the genome and activate endogenous gene expression, and does not rely on established methods of cellular reprogramming that require the transduction of multiple transcription factors. Any U.S. patents that may issue from patent applications pending in the U.S. and internationally in this portfolio will have a statutory expiration date in 2038.
 We also have licensed exclusive rights to four families of patent applications from the University of Minnesota. This portfolio includes over 40 issued patents or pending patent applications in the United States and foreign jurisdictions directed to compositions of NK cells, including adaptive memory NK cells and genetically-engineered NK cells, and therapeutic strategies for the treatment of cancer using these NK cells. These applications also describe methods of enhancing NK cell cytotoxicity by genetically engineering the CD16 Fc receptor in immune cells, including iPSC-derived NK cells, and describe methods of increasing NK cell tumor specificity and cytotoxicity by incorporating CARs on NK cells. Any U.S. patents that may issue from patent applications pending in this portfolio will have statutory expiration dates between 2035 and 2038.
 We also have exclusively licensed from The Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) intellectual property covering the production and composition of iPSC-derived T cells and their use in cellular immunotherapy, and have a license from MSK to two patent families covering novel CAR constructs as well as off-the-shelf CAR T cells, including the use of CRISPR and other innovative technologies for their production.

 Manufacturing
 Off-the-shelf, iPSC-derived Cellular Immunotherapies
 The manufacture of our off-the-shelf, iPSC-derived cellular immunotherapy product candidates involves a three-stage process:
  
• | The first stage is intended to generate a clonal master iPSC line and generally consists of the following steps: (i) obtain appropriately-consented healthy human donor cells, such as fibroblasts or hematopoietic cells, and conduct transfusion transmissible disease testing on the donor cells; (ii) induction of pluripotency in the donor cells using a proprietary transgene integration-free and footprint-free method of reprogramming; (iii) genetic engineering, where applicable, of iPSCs; and (iv) isolation and selection of a single iPSC, followed by clonal expansion of the single iPSC to produce a clonal master iPSC line for cell product manufacture.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The second stage is intended to derive the cell product population of interest and generally consists of the following steps: (i) expansion and differentiation of the clonal master iPSC line to produce CD34+ definitive hematopoietic progenitor cells; and (ii) further expansion and differentiation of these progenitor cells to produce the cell product population of interest.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The third stage is intended to derive the final cell product and generally consists of the following steps: (i) washing the cell product population; (ii) formulating the cell product population in an infusion media for intravenous administration of the final cell product; and (iii) cryopreserving individual aliquots of the final cell product and storing these aliquots in single-dose infusion bags.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 22


As part of our manufacturing process, we endeavor to utilize current Good Manufacturing Process (cGMP) grade materials and reagents, if commercially available; however, certain critical materials and reagents are currently qualified for research use only. Additionally, we obtain key components required for the manufacture of our iPSC-derived cell product candidates from third-party manufacturers and suppliers, which include, in some instances, sole source manufacturers and suppliers. We do not currently have long-term commitments or supply agreements in place to obtain certain key components used in the manufacture of our iPSC-derived cell product candidates.
 We are manufacturing our iPSC-derived cell product candidates for use in research, preclinical development, and clinical development. In September 2019, we opened our cGMP compliant manufacturing facility for the clinical production of our iPSC-derived cell product candidates. Our cGMP facility, located in San Diego, California, is custom designed for the manufacture of off-the-shelf cell product candidates using clonal master iPSC lines as the starting cell source. The new state-of-the-art facility has been commissioned and qualified, and we have been issued a drug manufacturing license by the State of California, Department of Health Services, Food and Drug Branch. In January 2020, we entered into a new lease agreement for a future headquarters facility, which is designed to include cGMP manufacturing. The lease is expected to commence, subject to certain conditions, in May 2021, and once complete, we intend to manufacture our iPSC-derived cell product candidates at this facility.
 We also contract with third parties, including medical center cell therapy facilities and contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs), for the conduct of some or all of the activities required for manufacturing our iPSC-derived cell product candidates for use in clinical investigation. We expect that we will continue to contract with third parties, including medical center cell therapy facilities and CMOs, for the conduct of some or all of the activities required for manufacturing our iPSC-derived cell product candidates. 
 ProTmune™
 ProTmune is a composition of ex vivo programmed human mobilized peripheral blood cells. ProTmune is produced by treating qualified human mobilized peripheral blood with two small molecules, FT1050 and FT4145, in a multi-step process that is performed on the day of HSCT. Currently, the manufacture of ProTmune is performed at clinical cell processing facilities operated by or affiliated with our clinical sites. The manufacturing process consists of functionally closed unit operations. We aim to continue to develop manufacturing processes to further standardize the manufacture of ProTmune across clinical cell processing facilities.
 Human peripheral blood cells sourced from a healthy donor, whose tissue type closely matches the patient’s, are used as the starting cellular source material for the manufacture of ProTmune. HSCT centers can electronically access a worldwide network of donor registries, which collect and transfer human peripheral blood cells sourced from healthy donors, to source these cells on behalf of patients. We expect donor registries to continue to collect and transfer, and HSCT centers to continue to source, human peripheral blood cells for our manufacture of ProTmune. Other components used in the manufacture of ProTmune include programming media as well as disposable materials, such as bags and tubing sets. To date, we have obtained all components required for the manufacture of ProTmune, including FT1050, FT4145 and programming media, from third-party manufacturers and suppliers, which include, in some instances, sole source manufacturers and suppliers. We do not currently have long-term commitments or supply agreements in place to obtain human peripheral blood cells and certain components used in the manufacture of ProTmune.
 For the conduct of our Phase 1/2 clinical trial of ProTmune, the clinical cell processing facility at each participating site is qualified and trained by our technical staff to manufacture ProTmune. Our technical representative(s) are on-site at the clinical cell processing facility for each of the first two subjects administered ProTmune at a participating site. ProTmune is released immediately by the clinical cell processing facility staff after final processing, including filtration, final packaging, rapid release testing, and labeling. In the future, we may manufacture ProTmune at facilities operated by us, by transplant centers, or by third parties.
 Marketing & Sales
 We currently intend to commercialize any products that we may successfully develop. We currently have no experience in marketing or selling therapeutic products. To market any of our products independently would require us to develop a sales force with technical expertise along with establishing commercial infrastructure and capabilities. Our commercial strategy for marketing our product candidates also may include the use of strategic partners, distributors, a contract sales force or the establishment of our own commercial infrastructure. We plan to further evaluate these alternatives as we approach approval for the first of our product candidates.

Government Regulation
 In the United States, the FDA regulates biological products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FDCA) and the Public Health Service Act (the PHS Act) and related regulations, and drugs under the FDCA and related regulations. Biological products and drugs are also subject to other federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations. The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, manufacture and marketing of biological products and drugs. These agencies and other federal, state, local, and foreign entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, packaging, labeling, storage, distribution, record keeping, reporting, approval or licensing, advertising and promotion, and import and export of our products. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. regulatory requirements at any time during the product development process or after approval may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. FDA sanctions include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval or suspension or revocation of a license, clinical hold, warning or untitled letters, voluntary or mandatory product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties. In addition, government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of product candidates for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures upon our activities.
Marketing Approval
 The process required by the FDA before biological products and drugs may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
  
• | completion of nonclinical laboratory and animal tests according to good laboratory practices (GLPs) and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND application which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practices (GCPs) and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biological product or drug for its intended use or uses;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | for a biological product, submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application (BLA) for marketing approval that includes substantive evidence of safety, purity, and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials, and, for a drug, submission of a New Drug Application (NDA) that includes substantive evidence of the product’s safety and efficacy;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities where the product is produced to assess compliance with the FDA’s cGMPs to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate, and, if applicable, current good tissue practices (cGTPs) for the use of human cellular and tissue products to prevent the introduction, transmission or spread of communicable diseases;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential FDA audit of the nonclinical study sites and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA or NDA; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA and review and approval of the NDA which must occur before a biological product and a drug can be marketed or sold.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

U.S. Biological Products and Drug Development Process
 Before testing any biological product or drug candidate in humans, nonclinical tests, including laboratory evaluations and animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate, are conducted. The conduct of the nonclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs.
 Prior to commencing the first clinical trial, the trial sponsor must submit the results of the nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of an initial IND application. Some nonclinical testing may continue even after the IND application is submitted. The IND application automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial and places the trial on a clinical hold. In such case, the sponsor of the IND application must resolve any outstanding concerns with the FDA before the clinical trial may begin. The FDA also may impose a clinical hold on ongoing clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If a clinical hold is imposed, a trial may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. A clinical hold may either be a full clinical hold or a partial 
 24


clinical hold that would limit a trial, for example, to certain doses or for a certain length of time or to a certain number of subjects.  Further, an independent institutional review board (IRB) for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that site. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of study subjects and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA and to the IRB. Information about certain clinical studies must be submitted with specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health for public dissemination at www.clinicaltrials.gov.
 For purposes of BLA or NDA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap:
  
• | Phase 1—The investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. These trials may also provide early evidence on effectiveness.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2—These trials are conducted in a limited number of patients in the target population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3—Phase 3 trials are undertaken to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further evaluate dosage, potency, and safety in an expanded patient population at multiple clinical trial sites. They are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the product has been obtained, and are intended to establish the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational product, and to provide an adequate basis for product approval and physician labeling.

 Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials may be required by the FDA as a condition of approval and are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up. The FDA has statutory authority to require post-market clinical trials to address safety issues. All of these trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements in order for the data to be considered reliable for regulatory purposes.
 During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting, written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events; any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects; or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information.
 Regulatory authorities, a data safety monitoring board or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the participants are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the investigated product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients, and the trial may not recommence without the IRB’s authorization.
 Typically, if a product is intended to treat a chronic disease, safety and efficacy data must be gathered over an extended period of time, which can range from six months to three years or more.
 25


Concurrently with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the investigational product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with the use of biological products, the PHS Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency, and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 A drug being studied in clinical trials may be made available to individual patients in certain circumstances. Pursuant to the 21st Century Cures Act (the Cures Act), as amended, the manufacturer of an investigational drug for a serious disease or condition is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for individual patient access to such investigational drug. This requirement applies on the earlier of the first initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 trial of the investigational drug, or as applicable, 15 days after the drug receives a designation as a breakthrough therapy, fast track product, or regenerative advanced therapy. Further, the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017 (the Right to Try Act) among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to request access to certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval.  There is no obligation for a pharmaceutical manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act. We review each individual request for access through the Cures Act, the Right to Try Act and similar state laws, and may or may not provide access depending upon the facts of each request.
 U.S. Review and Approval Processes
 In order to obtain approval to market a biological product in the United States, a BLA must be submitted to the FDA that provides data establishing to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety, purity and potency of the investigational product for the proposed indication. Similarly, for a drug, an NDA must be submitted to the FDA that provides data demonstrating the drug is safe and effective. Both a BLA and an NDA include all data available from nonclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s manufacture and composition, and proposed labeling.
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), as amended, each BLA and NDA must be accompanied by a user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. According to the FDA’s fee schedule, effective through September 30, 2021, the user fee for an application requiring clinical data, such as a BLA and an NDA, is $2,875,842. PDUFA also imposes an annual prescription drug product program fee for biologics and drugs ($336,432). Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business having fewer than 500 employees. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs or NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
 The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of a BLA or NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA or NDA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA or NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. After the BLA or NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the BLA or NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMPs to assure and preserve the product’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency, and purity, and for a biological product, whether it meets the biological product standards. The FDA may refer applications for novel products or products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically comprised of clinicians and other experts, for evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and, if so, under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 Before approving a BLA or NDA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. For a human cellular or tissue product, the FDA also will not approve the product if the manufacturer is not in compliance with cGTPs. FDA regulations also require tissue establishments to register and list their human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue based products (HCT/Ps) with the FDA and, when applicable, to evaluate donors through screening and testing. Additionally, before approving a BLA or NDA, the FDA may inspect clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND study requirements and GCPs. If the FDA determines the manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it typically will outline the deficiencies and often will require the facility to take corrective action and provide documentation evidencing the implementation of such corrective action, which may delay further review of the application. If the FDA finds that a clinical site did not conduct the clinical trial in accordance with GCPs, the FDA may determine the data generated by the site should be excluded from the primary efficacy analyses provided in the BLA or NDA, and request additional testing or data. Additionally, the FDA ultimately may still decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
 26


The FDA also has authority to require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) from manufacturers to ensure that the benefits of a biological product or drug outweigh its risks. A sponsor may also voluntarily propose a REMS as part of the BLA or NDA submission. The need for a REMS is determined as part of the review of the BLA or NDA. Based on statutory standards, elements of a REMS may include “dear doctor letters,” a medication guide, more elaborate targeted educational programs, and in some cases restrictions on distribution. These elements are negotiated as part of the BLA or NDA approval, and in some cases may delay the approval date. Once adopted, REMS are subject to periodic assessment and modification.
 After the FDA completes its initial review of a BLA or NDA, it will communicate to the sponsor that the biological product will either be approved, or it will issue a complete response letter to communicate that the BLA or NDA will not be approved in its current form. The complete response letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA or NDA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the applicant in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA or NDA to address all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application, or request a hearing.
 One of the performance goals of the FDA under PDUFA is to review 90% of standard BLAs and NDAs in 10 months and 90% of priority BLAs and NDAs in six months, whereupon a review decision is to be made. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs and NDAs and its review goals are subject to change from time to time. The review process and the PDUFA goal data may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the BLA or NDA applicant otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date.
 Even if a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be limited to specific disease states, patient populations and dosages, or the indications for use may otherwise be limited. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings, or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a risk management plan, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require Phase 4 post-marketing clinical trials and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. Further, even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in the imposition of new restrictions on the product or complete withdrawal of the product from the market.
 Expedited Development and Review Programs
 The FDA has a Fast Track program intended to facilitate the development and expedite the review of new drugs and biological products that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition or disease and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a biological product or drug may request the FDA to designate the biologic or drug as a Fast Track product at any time during clinical development. Unique to a Fast Track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the marketing application on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application.
 Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a biological product or drug designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. Additionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug or biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a biological product or drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials. 
 27


The FDCA also requires FDA to expedite the development and review of a breakthrough therapy. A biological product or drug can be designated as a breakthrough therapy if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that it may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. A sponsor may request that a biological product or drug be designated as a breakthrough therapy at any time during the clinical development of the product. If so designated, FDA shall act to expedite the development and review of the product’s marketing application, including by meeting with, and providing advice to, the sponsor throughout the product’s development, and taking steps to facilitate an efficient review of the development program and to ensure that the design of the clinical trials is as efficient as practicable.
 Fast Track designation, priority review, accelerated approval, and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.
 Accelerated Approval for Regenerative Advanced Therapies 
 As part of the Cures Act, Congress amended the FDCA to create an accelerated approval program for regenerative advanced therapies, which include cell therapies, therapeutic tissue engineering products, human cell and tissue products, and combination products using any such therapies or products. Regenerative advanced therapies do not include those human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products regulated solely under section 361 of the PHS Act and 21 CFR Part 1271. This program is intended to facilitate efficient development and expedite review of regenerative advanced therapies, which are intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. A drug sponsor may request that FDA designate a drug as a regenerative advanced therapy concurrently with or at any time after submission of an IND. FDA has 60 calendar days to determine whether the drug meets the criteria, including whether there is preliminary clinical evidence indicating that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. A BLA or NDA for a regenerative advanced therapy may be eligible for priority review or accelerated approval through (1) surrogate or intermediate endpoints reasonably likely to predict long-term clinical benefit or (2) reliance upon data obtained from a meaningful number of sites. Benefits of such designation also include early interactions with FDA to discuss any potential surrogate or intermediate endpoint to be used to support accelerated approval. A regenerative advanced therapy that is granted accelerated approval and is subject to post approval requirements may fulfill such requirements through the submission of clinical evidence, clinical studies, patient registries, or other sources of real world evidence, such as electronic health records; the collection of larger confirmatory data sets; or post approval monitoring of all patients treated with such therapy prior to its approval.
U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
 Under certain circumstances, U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. Patent term restoration can compensate for time lost during product development and the regulatory review process by returning up to five years of patent life for a patent that covers a new product or its use. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The period of patent term restoration is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND application (falling after issuance of the patent) and the submission date of a BLA or NDA, plus the time between the submission date of the BLA or NDA and the approval of that application, provided the sponsor acted with diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The application for patent term extension is subject to approval by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in consultation with the FDA. A patent term extension is only available when the FDA approves a biological product or drug for the first time.
 With the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, Congress authorized the FDA to approve generic drugs that are the same as drugs previously approved by the FDA under the NDA provisions of the FDCA. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit to the agency an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) which relies on the preclinical and clinical testing previously conducted for a drug approved under an NDA, known as the reference listed drug (RLD). For the ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, and the strength of the drug. The FDA must also determine that the generic drug is bioequivalent to the innovator drug.
 An abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, a FDA-licensed reference biological product was created by the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, which was part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA). This amendment to the PHS Act attempts to minimize duplicative testing. Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical trial or trials. Interchangeability requires that a biological product is biosimilar to the reference biological product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the product and the reference product may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biological product.
 28


A reference biological product is granted twelve years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product. The first biological product submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product has exclusivity against other biologics submitting under the abbreviated approval pathway for the lesser of (i) one year after the first commercial marketing, (ii) 18 months after approval if there is no legal challenge, (iii) 18 months after the resolution in the applicant’s favor of a lawsuit challenging the biologic’s patents if an application has been submitted, or (iv) 42 months after the application has been approved if a lawsuit is ongoing within the 42-month period.
 A biological product or drug can obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study.
 Orphan Designation
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to biological products and drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a biological product or drug in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting a BLA or NDA. After the FDA grants orphan designation, the identity of the applicant, the name of the therapeutic agent and its designated orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
 If a biological product or drug that receives orphan designation is the first such product approved by FDA for the orphan indication, it receives orphan product exclusivity, which for seven years prohibits the FDA from approving another application to market the same product for the same indication. Orphan product exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if the new product is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety or a demonstration that the new product otherwise makes a major contribution to patient care. More than one product may also be approved by the FDA for the same orphan indication or disease as long as the products are different. If a biological product or drug designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union has similar, but not identical, benefits.
 Pediatric Research Equity Act
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA), as amended, a BLA or NDA or supplement must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product or drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The intent of PREA is to compel sponsors whose products have pediatric applicability to study those products in pediatric populations. The FDCA requires manufacturers of biological products and drugs that include a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration to submit a pediatric study plan to the FDA as part of the IND application. The plan must be submitted not later than 60 days after the end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA; or if there is no such meeting, before the initiation of any Phase 3 trials or a combined Phase 2 and Phase 3 trial; or if no such trial will be conducted, no later than 210 days before submitting a marketing application or supplement. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Generally, PREA does not apply to any biological product or drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
Healthcare Reform and Other Regulatory Changes
 In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and likely will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system directed at broadening the availability of healthcare, improving the quality of healthcare, and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare.
 For example, in March 2010, the ACA was enacted in the United States. The ACA includes measures that have significantly changed, and are expected to continue to significantly change, the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the provisions of the ACA of greatest importance to the pharmaceutical industry are that the ACA:
  
• | subjects biological products to potential competition by biosimilars;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs to 23.1% of average manufacturer price (AMP), and adding a new rebate calculation for “line extensions” (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 29


 
• | imposed a requirement on manufacturers of branded drugs to provide a 70% point-of-sale discount off the negotiated price of branded drugs dispensed to Medicare Part D beneficiaries in the coverage gap (i.e., “donut hole”) as a condition for a manufacturer’s outpatient drugs being covered under Medicare Part D;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | extended a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expanded the entities eligible for discounts under the 340B Drug Discount Program;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | established a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | imposed an annual, nondeductible fee and tax on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | imposed new reporting requirements on drug manufacturers for payments made to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit required information may result in significant civil monetary penalties for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately and completely reported in an annual submission; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | established a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. The research conducted by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute may affect the market for certain pharmaceutical products. The ACA established the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) within the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Since its enactment, there have been numerous judicial, administrative, executive, and legislative challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. Various portions of the ACA are currently undergoing legal and constitutional challenges in the United States Supreme Court; the former administration issued various Executive Orders which eliminated cost sharing subsidies and various provisions that would impose a fiscal burden on states or a cost, fee, tax, penalty or regulatory burden on individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices; and Congress has introduced several pieces of legislation aimed at significantly revising or repealing the ACA. The United States Supreme Court is expected to rule on a legal challenge to the constitutionality of the ACA in early 2021. The implementation of the ACA is ongoing, and the law appears likely to continue the downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs. Litigation and legislation related to the ACA are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results. 
 Congress may consider additional legislation to repeal, replace, or further modify elements of the ACA. In addition, the Biden administration may take steps to repeal, replace, or further modify elements of the ACA and regulatory actions taken by the previous administration. Thus, the full impact of the ACA, or any law repealing, replacing or modifying elements of it, and the political uncertainty regarding any repeal, replacement or modification of the ACA, on our business remains unclear. We expect that additional federal healthcare reform measures may be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare drugs, biologics and services.
 There has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. At the federal level, the previous administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2021 includes a $135 billion allowance to support legislative proposals seeking to reduce drug prices, increase competition, lower out-of-pocket drug costs for patients, and increase patient access to lower-cost generic and biosimilar drugs. On March 10, 2020, the previous administration sent “principles” for drug pricing to Congress, calling for legislation that would, among other things, cap Medicare Part D beneficiary out-of-pocket pharmacy expenses, provide an option to cap Medicare Part D beneficiary monthly out-of-pocket expenses, and place limits on pharmaceutical price increases. Additionally, the Trump administration released a “Blueprint” to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, has already implemented certain measures. For example, in May 2019, CMS issued a final rule to allow Medicare Advantage Plans the option of using step therapy for Part B drugs beginning January 1, 2020. Although a number of these, and other proposed measures may require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress has indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative measures to control drug costs. Additionally, it is unclear whether the Biden administration will challenge, reverse, revoke or 
 30


otherwise modify previous administrative and executive actions. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
 Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
 In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, CMS, other divisions of HHS, (e.g., the Office of Inspector General, or OIG), the United States Department of Justice and individual United States Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments. For example, our clinical research, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs may have to comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the false claims laws, the privacy and security provisions of the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and similar state laws, each as amended, as applicable, including:

• | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual, or the purchase, lease, order, arrangement or recommendation of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act or federal civil money penalties statute;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including the False Claims Act, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment to, or approval by Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs, knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim or an obligation to pay or transmit money to the federal government, or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Manufacturers can be held liable under the False Claims Act even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. The False Claims Act also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the False Claims Act and to share in any monetary recovery;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the anti-inducement law, which prohibits, among other things, the offering or giving of remuneration, which includes, without limitation, any transfer of items or services for free or for less than fair market value (with limited exceptions), to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular supplier of items or services reimbursable by a federal or state governmental program;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HIPAA, which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private) and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statements or representations in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters; similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, and their respective implementing regulations, which impose requirements on certain covered healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses as well as their respective business associates that perform services for them that involve the use, or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information, relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;

 In addition to the above, on November 20, 2020, OIG finalized further modifications to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Under the final rules, OIG added safe harbor protections under the Anti-Kickback Statute for certain coordinated care and value-based arrangements among clinicians, providers, and others. Simultaneously, HHS removed safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers. HHS has delayed the implementation of the removal of safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers and creation of a new safe harbor for certain fixed fees rule to March 22, 2021. We continue to evaluate what effect, if any, these rules will have on our business.
 Additionally, we may be subject now or in the future to state and foreign equivalents of each of the healthcare laws and regulations described above, among others, some of which may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of the payor. Many U.S. states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act, and may apply to our business practices, including, but not limited to, research, distribution, sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental payors, including private insurers. In addition, some states have passed laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the April 2003 OIG Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and/or the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America’s Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals. Several states also impose other marketing restrictions or require pharmaceutical companies to make marketing or price disclosures to the state. There are ambiguities as to what is required to comply with these state requirements and if we fail to comply with an applicable state law requirement, we could be subject to penalties. 
 Regulations Governing Data Collection and the Use, Processing and Cross-Border Transfer of Personal Information
 We also may be or may become subject to various state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 For example, California has enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which creates new individual privacy rights for California consumers (as defined in the law) and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of consumers or households. Effective as of January 2020, the CCPA requires covered companies to provide certain disclosures to consumers about its data collection, use and sharing practices, and to provide affected California residents with ways to opt out of certain sales or transfers of personal information, and also regulates employee information. Further, a new California privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), was passed by California voters in November 2020. The CPRA will create additional obligations with respect to processing and storing personal information that are scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2023 (with certain provisions having retroactive effect to January 1, 2022). While there is currently an exception in the CCPA and CPRA for protected health information that is subject to HIPAA, the CCPA and CPRA may impact our business activities. Other U.S. states also are considering omnibus privacy legislation, and industry organizations regularly adopt and advocate for new standards in these areas.
 In addition, as of May 25, 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) regulates the collection and use of personal data in the European Union (EU). The GDPR covers any business, regardless of its location, that provides goods or services to residents in the EU and, thus, could incorporate any activities we undertake in EU member states. The GDPR imposes strict requirements on controllers and processors of personal data, including special protections for “sensitive information,” which includes health and genetic information of individuals residing in the EU. GDPR grants individuals the opportunity to object to the processing of their personal information, allows them to request deletion of personal information in certain circumstances, and provides the individual with an express right to seek legal remedies in the event the individual believes his or her rights have been violated. Further, the GDPR imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the EU to regions that have not been deemed to offer “adequate” privacy protections, such as the U.S. currently. Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the EU member states, which may deviate slightly from the GDPR, may result in warning letters, mandatory audits and financial penalties, including fines of up to 4% of global revenues, or €20,000,000, whichever is greater.

Further to the United Kingdom's (UK) exit from the EU on January 31, 2020, the GDPR ceased to apply in the UK at the end of the transition period on December 31, 2020. However, as of January 1, 2021, the UK’s European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 incorporated the GDPR (as it existed on December 31, 2020 but subject to certain UK specific amendments) into UK law (referred to as the 'UK GDPR'). The UK GDPR and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 set out the UK’s data protection regime, which is independent from but aligned to the EU’s data protection regime. Non-compliance with the UK GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to £17.5 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is higher. The UK, however, is now regarded as a third country under the EU’s GDPR which means that transfers of personal data from the EEA to the UK will be restricted unless an appropriate safeguard, as recognized by the EU’s GDPR, has been put in place. Although under the EU-UK Trade Cooperation Agreement it is lawful to transfer personal data between the UK and the EEA for a 6 month period following the end of the transition period, with a view to achieving an adequacy decision from the European Commission during that period. Like the EU GDPR, the UK GDPR restricts personal data transfers outside the UK to countries not regarded by the UK as providing adequate protection (this means that personal data transfers from the UK to the EEA remain free flowing). There is significant uncertainty related to the manner in which data protection authorities will seek to enforce compliance with GDPR. For example, it is unclear whether the authorities will conduct random audits of companies doing business in the EU or UK, or act solely after complaints are filed claiming a violation of the GDPR or UK GDPR. 
 Other Regulations
 We are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future.
Competition
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapid innovation, intense and dynamic competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, scientific knowledge and experience in the field of cellular immunotherapy provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions, as well as standard-of-care treatments, new products undergoing development and combinations of existing and new therapies. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies, including combinations thereof, that may become available in the future.
 Cellular immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer have recently been an area of significant research and development by academic institutions and biopharmaceutical companies. Novartis AG (Novartis) and Kite Pharma, Inc. (Kite) were the first to obtain FDA approval for autologous CAR T-cell therapies for the treatment of certain cancers. Novartis obtained FDA approval to commercialize Kymriah in August 2017 for the treatment of children and young adults with relapsed / refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and, in May 2018, for the treatment of adults with relapsed / refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. In October 2017, Kite obtained FDA approval to commercialize Yescarta for the treatment of adults with relapsed / refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. 
 We are developing our off-the-shelf NK- and T-cell product candidates for the treatment of cancer. While we believe our use of clonal master iPSC lines for the production of our off-the-shelf NK- and T-cell product candidates is highly differentiated, a number of companies are currently focused on the development of cellular immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer including Allogene Therapeutics, Inc., Atara Biotherapeutics, Inc., bluebird bio, Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Cellectis SA, CRISPR Therapeutics AG, Gilead Sciences, Inc., Intellia Therapeutics, Inc., Iovance Biotherapeutics, Inc., Johnson & Johnson, Legend Biotech Corporation, NantKwest, Inc., Nkarta, Inc., Novartis AG, Sanofi SA, and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
 We are developing ProTmune as a next-generation mobilized peripheral blood graft for patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT. ProTmune is designed to prevent GvHD and other life-threatening complications that compromise the procedure’s curative potential. There are currently no FDA-approved therapies for the prevention of acute GvHD. Corticosteroids, or steroids, remain the first-line of treatment for GvHD, and second-line therapy consists of off-label use of immunosuppressive agents. We are aware of other companies and medical centers that are developing prophylaxes for GvHD and treatments for acute GvHD and other life-threatening complications of HSCT, including AbbVie Inc., Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, and Incyte Corporation. 
 We compete against our competitors in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical study sites and subject enrollment for clinical studies, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Many of our competitors, either alone or with their collaboration partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates,

obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of treatments and commercializing those treatments. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining approval for treatments and achieving widespread market acceptance. 
 We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new products enter the market and advanced technologies become available. We expect any treatments that we develop and commercialize to compete on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, convenience of administration and delivery, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payers. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. 
 Insurance
 We maintain product liability insurance for our clinical trials. We intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products if marketing approval is obtained for products in development. However, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive, and we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability. In addition, we may not be able to obtain commercially reasonable product liability insurance for any products approved for marketing.
Human Capital
 As of December 31, 2020, we employed 279 employees, all of whom are full-time employees, including 127 in research and development, 113 in clinical development, manufacturing and regulatory affairs and 39 in general and administrative. We have never had a work stoppage, and none of our employees is represented by a labor organization or under any collective bargaining arrangements. We consider our employee relations to be good.
 We focus on identifying, recruiting, developing and retaining a team of highly talented and motivated employees. The principal purposes of our equity and cash incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of stock-based and cash-based compensation awards, as well providing our employees with the opportunity to participate in our employee stock purchase plan, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives. The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being, health and safety of our employees. In an effort to protect the health and safety of our employees, we took proactive action from the earliest signs of the COVID-19 outbreak, which included implementing social distancing policies at our facilities, facilitating remote working arrangements and imposing employee travel restrictions.
