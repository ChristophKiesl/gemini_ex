Corporate History
 
Formation and Business Development
 
The Company was incorporated in the state of Nevada on December 8, 2009, under the name Pristine Solutions, Inc.
 
During the fiscal years ended January 31, 2012 thorough 2015 the Company acquired various projects and corporate entities across various industry sectors in an effort to commence revenue generating operations. As a result of the transition in business focus, management teams and controlling shareholders over these fiscal periods, the Company changed its name from Pristine Solutions Inc. to Eaton Scientific Systems Inc. effective November 27, 2012, and subsequently to Eco Science Solutions, Inc. during February 2014, in order to better reflect its evolving business operations. The Company effected a 1000-to-1 reverse stock split in February 2014.
 
On December 15, 2015, our current management, Mr. Jeffery Taylor and Mr. Don Taylor became the controlling shareholders of the Company. Presently Jeffery and Don Taylor control approximately 16% of the issued and outstanding shares.
 
Effective December 17, 2015, Mr. Jeffery Taylor was appointed to serve as Chief Executive Officer and President of the Company and Mr. Don Lee Taylor was appointed to serve as Chief Financial Officer of the Company. Upon this change in control, the direction of business turned to a focus on eco-friendly products and related businesses. Between 2015 and 2017 the Company worked to develop certain apps known as Herbo and Fitrix for introduction to the marketplace.
 
The Fitrix app was intended to keep track of users day-to-day fitness routines, dietary habits and alternative medicine intake.   During fiscal 2020, the Company determined to cease support of the Fitrix app and fold in certain functionality contained into its Herbo app and suite of enterprise software.
 
The Herbo apps, was developed to help users find dispensary locations, view available product inventory, provide access to delivery services, as well as connect with alternative doctors to provide evaluations. Additionally, the product was architected to provide e-commerce, point of sale and supporting operational enterprise software as a service to business customers.

During fiscal 2018 ESSI acquired 100% of the shares of capital stock of Ga-Du Corporation (GD or Ga-Du)), at which time Ga-Du became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Concurrent with the transaction, on June 21, 2017, Mr. John Lewis and Mr. S. Randall Oveson joined the Board of directors of ESSI. Ga-Du offers a Financial Services Platform, bringing important enterprise FinTech technologies in-house and bringing ESSI an opportunity to expand the reach of its Herbo product suite.
 
GD provides financial and enterprise services to businesses and individuals, including the cannabis industry, on a programmatic or membership basis from which GD derives fees and income from enrolling companies in their financial program and providing a range of services, with respect to which GD derive fees and income on a fee-based schedule.
 
The primary focus of GD is providing a mobile application known as eXPO™ (Electronic eXchange Portal) which provides virtual financial and enterprise services to businesses and individuals that are challenged in the traditional banking systems, and/or require more intensive compliance than banks are willing, or able to perform and/or do not have the technical expertise or financial wherewithal in house to develop their own FinTech solutions, including accounting and enterprise management software.  One such industry is the cannabis industry in where Membership relationships are formed with businesses in this industry, following a full compliance audit on the business. These services utilize the Herbo suite of software to effectively track transactional data for eXPO™ users.
 
On March 1, 2019 the Company and Haiku Holdings, LLC (“Haiku”), a limited liability company owned by The Rountree Trust, of which Michael Rountree, the Company’s COO at the time of the agreement, is the Trustee, entered into a Trademark Licensing Agreement.  Under the terms of the agreement, the Licensed Marks, including and incorporating Herbo, may be used by Haiku to facilitate the Company’s business including lead generation and referral services. Further, as a result of any revenue generating business generated by Haiku, the Company shall receive 90% of the net revenue. The license remains in effect for a period of ten (10) years from the effective date of the agreement and may be terminated on sixty (60) days written notice by the Company should there be a material breach which remains uncured, or at any time on ten (10) days written notice by Haiku without cause.
 
Effective July 1, 2019, the Company (“Reseller”) entered into a Software Reseller Agreement with respect to the Herbo suite of software offerings with Haiku (“Licensor”).

Government Regulations
 
Cannabis is currently a Schedule I controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) and is, therefore, illegal under federal law. Even in those states in which the use of cannabis has been legalized pursuant to state law, its use, possession or cultivation remains a violation of federal law. A Schedule I controlled substance is defined as one that has no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of safety for use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse. The U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) defines Schedule I controlled substances as “the most dangerous drugs of all the drug schedules with potentially severe psychological or physical dependence.” If the federal government decides to enforce the CSA, persons that are charged with distributing, possessing with intent to distribute or growing cannabis could be subject to fines and/or terms of imprisonment, the maximum being life imprisonment and a $50 million fine, even though these persons are in compliance with state law.
 
In light of such conflict between federal laws and state laws regarding cannabis, the previous administration had effectively stated that it was not an efficient use of resources to direct federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by state-designated laws allowing the use and distribution of medical cannabis. Although they have not done so, the current administration could decide to strongly enforce the federal laws applicable to cannabis. See Justice Department Memo on Marijuana Enforcement discussed below.  Any such change in the federal government’s enforcement of current federal laws could impact our planned business operation. Because the business activities of businesses, engaged in the medicinal cannabis industry, that we may direct our customers is illegal under federal law, we may be deemed to be aiding and abetting illegal activities through the location services that we provide to our customers, relative to the cannabis industry.  As a result, we may be subject to actions by law enforcement authorities, which would materially and adversely affect our business. Legislation is currently pending in the U.S. Congress which would reclassify cannabis from Schedule 1 to Schedule 3. If enacted into law, such change could provide a material benefit to businesses engaged in the cultivation and sale of cannabis, including eligibility for federal tax deductions, access to the banking system and generally de-criminalizing the use or sale of cannabis where it is legal under applicable state laws.
 
The current administration has indicated that it will closely scrutinize the cannabis industry, in particular, recreational marijuana. While we do not directly engage in the sale or cultivation of cannabis, changes in laws, rules and regulations could have a material adverse or positive effect on our business and financial condition.
 
Justice Department Memo on Marijuana Enforcement
 
Because of the inconsistencies in federal and state law, on January 4, 2018, the Department of Justice (DOJ) issued a memo on federal marijuana enforcement policy announcing what it deemed to be a return to the rule of law and the rescission of previous guidance documents which would include the so called Cole Memorandum. Since the passage of the Controlled Substances Act in 1970, Congress has generally prohibited the cultivation, distribution, and possession of marijuana. In the memorandum, the Attorney General directed all U.S. Attorneys to enforce the laws enacted by Congress and to follow well-established principles when pursuing prosecutions related to marijuana activities. The DOJ asserts this return to the rule of law is also a return of trust and local control to federal prosecutors who know where and how to deploy Justice Department resources most effectively to reduce violent crime, stem the tide of the drug crisis, and dismantle criminal gangs.
 
On April 13, 2018 it was announced that President Donald Trump had promised Senate Republican Cory Gardner that he will support congressional efforts to protect states that have legalized marijuana, defusing a months-long standoff between Sen. Cory Gardner and the administration over Justice Department nominees. Trump told Gardner that despite the DOJ memo of January 4, 2018, the marijuana industry in Colorado will not be targeted. A bill has not been finalized, but discussion has commenced to find legislation that would, in effect, make clear the federal government cannot interfere with states that have voted to legalize marijuana.(1)

Here is now publication on this matter taken from https://globalcannabiscompliance.bakermckenzie.com/2020/01/06/the-sessions-memorandum-two-years-later/
 
January 4, 2020 marked the two year anniversary of the “Sessions Memorandum“ in which (then) Attorney General Jeff Sessions rescinded the Cole Memorandum and other Obama era DOJ guidance which essentially stated that DOJ would not prosecute state-compliant marijuana-related activity.  Many saw the statement as a declaration of a new “War on Drugs.” However, a review of DOJ cases brought over the last two years reveals that the Trump Justice Department has largely adhered to the Obama Administration’s enforcement priorities.
 
The Cole Memorandum
 
The Cole Memorandum stated that federal cannabis enforcement resources would be concentrated on cases involving:
 

● | Revenue from the sale of cannabis going to criminal enterprises, gangs, and cartels, 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | State authorized cannabis activity being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity, 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of cannabis, 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Distribution of cannabis to minors, 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Diversion of cannabis from states where it is legal under state law in some form to other states, 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Drugged driving and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with cannabis use, 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Growing of cannabis on public lands and the attendant public safety and environmental dangers posed by cannabis production on public lands, and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Cannabis possession or use on federal property. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The Cole Memorandum also stated that:
 
In jurisdictions that have enacted laws legalizing marijuana in some form and that have also implemented strong and effective regulatory and enforcement systems to control the cultivation, distribution, sale, and possession of marijuana, conduct in compliance with those laws and regulations is less likely to threaten the federal priorities set forth above…. The primary question in all cases – and in all jurisdictions-should be whether the conduct at issue implicates one or more of the enforcement priorities listed above.
 
In other words, so long as a marijuana business complied with state law, it would not be subject to federal prosecution unless it violated one of the Cole Memorandum priorities.  At his confirmation hearing in 2018, Attorney General Barr suggested that DOJ would not prosecute state compliant marijuana activity but has left the Sessions Memorandum in place as official DOJ policy.  Nevertheless, the Sessions Memorandum appears to have done little to change Obama Administration policy.
 
DOJ Cases
 
We reviewed DOJ press releases on approximately 50 federal prosecutions involving marijuana during the period 2018-2020 and did not find one that involved purely state compliant activity. In fact, almost all involved Cole Memorandum priorities – most commonly, organized crime, the use of firearms, and trafficking of other illegal drugs. Those prosecutions which did not involve one of the Cole Memorandum priorities took place in states where recreational marijuana has not (or had not yet) been legalized, such as Texas, Oklahoma and Georgia.
 
This review also revealed another federal enforcement priority not identified in the Cole Memorandum – public corruption in the marijuana industry.  For example, one reported case involved a former Maryland state delegate who allegedly took bribes in exchange for voting in favor of a bill to increase the number of medical marijuana grower and processing licenses available to an out-of-state company. Another involved a police officer who used his official position to protect a marijuana trafficking business. One case involved a Border Patrol Agent who took bribes from a suspected drug trafficker in exchange for information about Customs Border Protection surveillance. Another involved the prosecution of the Mayor of Fall River, Massachusetts for extorting more than $250,000 in bribes from cannabis businesses in return for assistance with licenses.

In such official extortion cases, legitimate marijuana businesses, far from being prosecuted, are actually treated as victims. We did not identify any cases involving the prosecution of financial institutions for laundering marijuana proceeds. Nor did we identify any cases involving the prosecution of ancillary legitimate businesses that supported marijuana businesses by providing them with otherwise legitimate products or services.
 
Finally, almost all of the DOJ press releases express appreciation to state and local law enforcement and many cited the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF) program, a federal multi-agency, multi-jurisdictional task force that supplies supplemental federal funding to federal and state agencies to help them disrupt and dismantle drug trafficking organizations. Such statements indicate the great extent to which federal narcotics enforcement is dependent on assistance from state and local law enforcement. As long as this remains the case, state compliant behavior is unlikely to be prosecuted, regardless of DOJ’s publicly stated policy.
 
Industrial Hemp
 
Industrial hemp is now legal in the U.S., which advocates hope could eventually loosen laws around the popular marijuana extract CBD.
 
The 2018 farm bill which legalized hemp including a variety of cannabis that does not produce the psychoactive component of marijuana, paved the way to legitimacy for an agricultural sector that has been operating on the fringe of the law. Industrial hemp has made investors and executives swoon because of the potential multibillion-dollar market for cannabidiol, or CBD, a non-psychoactive compound that has started to turn up in beverages, health products and pet snacks, among other products.
 
Currently, it appears that CBD will remain largely off-limits for ingestible products. The Food and Drug Administration issued a statement saying that despite the new status of hemp, CBD is still considered a drug ingredient and remains illegal to add to food or health products without the agency’s approval, disappointing many hemp advocates, who said they will continue to work to convince the FDA to loosen its CBD rules. The FDA said some hemp ingredients, such as hulled hemp seeds, hemp seed protein and hemp seed oil, are safe in food and won’t require additional approvals.
 
The farm bill places industrial hemp, which is defined as a cannabis plant with under 0.3% of tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, under the supervision of the Agriculture Department and removes CBD from the purview of the Controlled Substances Act, which covers marijuana. The law also “explicitly” preserved the Food and Drug Administration’s authority to regulate products containing cannabis, or cannabis-derived compounds.
