Business
 Overview
 We are a leading provider of silicon timing solutions. Our timing solutions are the heartbeat of our customers’ electronic systems, solve complex timing problems and enable industry-leading products. We provide solutions that are differentiated by high performance and reliability, programmability, small size, and low power consumption. Our products have been designed into over 250 applications across our target markets, including communications and enterprise, automotive, industrial, aerospace, and mobile, Internet of Thing (“IoT”), and consumer. Our current solutions include various types of oscillators, as well as resonators and clock integrated circuits (“ICs”). Our all-silicon solutions are based on three fundamental areas of expertise: micro-electro-mechanical systems (“MEMS”), analog mixed-signal design capabilities, and advanced system-level integration expertise. This expertise allows us to design MEMS resonators, analog circuits, as well as systems and packaging, and put these all together to deliver a system level solution that solves customers’ complex timing problems. In this aspect, we are different than quartz-based providers, who typically have expertise in designing and manufacturing resonators, but typically outsource the analog and packaging. We are also different in that our MEMS resonators are made with silicon, while the quartz suppliers use quartz crystal technology. Our timing solutions are designed to be resilient to environmental stresses. For the communications and enterprise market, our timing solutions provide high performance and resilience in dense, less-controlled environments that experience harsh conditions–an advantage as equipment moves closer to the customer with the rollout of 5G. For the automotive market, our solutions can be utilized in automotive electronics, as well as advanced driver assistance systems (“ADAS”) for self-driving cars, which require increased timing accuracy.  For the industrial market, our products offer high reliability for the diverse operating conditions of industrial equipment, including high temperatures, rapidly changing temperatures, mechanical shock and vibration. For the aerospace market, our solutions provide lower acceleration sensitivity for end products that operate in rugged conditions. For the mobile, IoT and consumer market, our silicon-based timing solutions have the advantage of offering high performance at optimal power consumption and size, as our customers fit more functionality into smaller devices. 
Industry Background
 Timing Solutions Enable Innovation and are Rapidly Evolving
 The ability to accurately measure and reference time has been essential to many of humankind’s greatest inventions and technological progress. Timing technology has continued to evolve over centuries, forming a critical aspect of broader technological advancement. Timing is the heartbeat of every digital electronic system, ensuring that the system runs smoothly and reliably by providing and distributing clock signals to various critical components such as CPUs, communication and interface chips, and radio frequency components. As electronics are expected to operate at higher performance levels in increasingly challenging environments, while also being more complex and footprint-constrained, we believe they will require more sophisticated timing solutions. For example, as 5G communications networks evolve, we expect that they will require higher precision from a greater number of oscillators and timing devices. 
Key Building Blocks of Timing Solutions
 Timing solutions comprise three key building blocks: resonators, oscillators, and clock ICs. While simpler systems generally require only an external resonator coupled with a basic embedded oscillator circuit, more complex systems require advanced timing solutions that may integrate a variety of resonators, oscillators, and clock ICs in a single chip package. The complexity of these timing solutions increases significantly when the performance requirements of the systems that use them increase, such as electronic systems required to support the 5G communication network infrastructure.

The key building blocks of SiTime’s timing solutions are:
  
• | Resonators – mechanical silicon structures that vibrate at a precise frequency and provide the core accuracy and stability in oscillator systems;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Oscillators – active systems that combine resonators with analog mixed-signal ICs that cause the resonators to vibrate, generating accurate and stable clock signals; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Clock ICs – integrated analog mixed-signal circuits that use phase-locked loops (“PLLs”), clock dividers, and drivers, and have multiple clock signals on the output of the system. Clock ICs require resonators and oscillators for timing references and may integrate these components into complex systems.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 These three building blocks may be used individually or in combination, depending on the end product’s performance, price, and size requirements.
 Limitations of Legacy Quartz-based Solutions
 For the past 70 years, quartz crystal has been the predominant technology of choice for resonators and will continue to play a role in the timing market. In a quartz oscillator, a quartz crystal resonator is paired with a silicon-based clock IC in a ceramic package. However, quartz timing devices, largely unchanged in decades, have many inherent limitations, including limited frequency ranges, sensitivity to rapid temperature changes, vibration and mechanical shock, susceptibility to frequency jumps at particular temperatures, and limited programmability. Quartz devices must be housed in ceramic packaging, and thus are difficult to integrate into standard semiconductor packages. Quartz products require dedicated manufacturing facilities and have relatively long lead times due to the need to specify various characteristics well in advance of production, without the ability to reconfigure them during the design cycle. In addition, as electronic systems become more complex, feature-rich, and robust, they require more sophisticated timing systems that can seamlessly integrate a variety of resonators, oscillators, and clock ICs in various system-level combinations. This seamless integration is more difficult with legacy quartz systems.
Silicon Timing Solutions Poised to Disrupt the Market
 In recent years, advances in silicon-based manufacturing and packaging techniques have allowed the development of alternatives to quartz crystal technology. We believe that silicon MEMS is an ideal technology for resonator design. Specifically, its ability to integrate with other circuits in standard semiconductor packages has made scalable standard silicon manufacturing possible for resonators and broader timing technology. MEMS and silicon-based technologies can operate in a wide range of frequencies, are more resistant to vibration, mechanical shock, and temperature changes, and are less susceptible to frequency jumps. These technologies are also inherently well-suited to produce timing solutions that are small, and offer high performance, robustness and programmability. Timing solutions based on these technologies are manufactured using semiconductor processes in fabrication plants with high capacity, allowing for cost-effective high-volume manufacturing.
 Significant Market Opportunity for Timing Solutions
 According to Dedalus Consulting - 2019 Frequency Control Components Global Markets, End-Users, Applications & Competitors: Analysis & Forecasts and our estimates, the global timing market was over $7.7 billion as of 2018 and is expected to grow to $10.1 billion by 2024. Dedalus Consulting estimates that oscillators and standalone resonators represented approximately $3.8 billion and $2.9 billion total addressable markets, respectively, as of 2018. Based on our internal estimates, we believe clock ICs represent an approximate $1.0 billion total addressable market. As a subset of the broader timing market, the market for MEMS oscillators is projected to grow from $0.1 billion in 2018 to $0.6 billion by 2024, representing a CAGR of 35.2%, according to Yole Développement’s report “Status of MEMS Industry 2019.”

The Opportunity for Advanced Solutions
 From high-performance network infrastructure equipment to low-power battery-operated devices, precise timing solutions enable virtually all electronics. The complexity of such timing solutions increases significantly with the performance requirements of the systems in which they are used. Below are some examples of end markets in which we believe our silicon-based timing is enabling or has the potential to enable, greater functionality than legacy solutions: 
 Telecommunications, Enterprise, and Cloud Infrastructure
 Communications infrastructure equipment used in wireless base stations, wired infrastructure equipment, enterprise networks, and cloud data centers must provide high performance and stability in demanding environments, which may include temperature fluctuations, mechanical shocks, and vibration. If the timing solution within the equipment fails, networks can shut down, leading to service disruptions and higher operating costs. According to Gartner, “Recent reports on 5G pilots and testing have identified a wide range of projected data throughput speeds ranging from 10 times up to 1,000 times faster than 4G. Other reports estimate ranges of one to 10 gigabytes per second.”Industrial
 Industrial equipment, ranging from factory machinery to medical devices, is often exposed to environments characterized by temperature fluctuation, mechanical shocks, vibration, and electromagnetic interference. We believe silicon-based timing solutions can perform better than legacy quartz-based solutions in demanding industrial environments at comparable cost and with lower power consumption and higher reliability.
Automotive
 For automotive applications, timing technology must perform reliably over the life of an automobile in an environment characterized by vibration, mechanical shocks, electromagnetic interference, wide temperature ranges, and rapid temperature change. The AECC (Automotive Edge Computing Consortium) estimated in 2020 that “data traffic from connected vehicles will exceed 1,000 times the present volume, surpassing 10 exabytes per month by 2025.” These communication systems will require precise timing. We believe silicon-based timing can address many of the challenges associated with this demanding automotive ecosystem.
 IoT and Mobile
 The IoT revolution will enable the proliferation of billions of internet-connected devices in industrial and consumer applications. These devices can range from personal wearable devices to electronics embedded in appliances and industrial machinery. Many of these devices need to package a significant amount of electronics in a limited battery-powered and size-constrained form factor, while still requiring high performance and high accuracy. Due to the ability to integrate with ICs, we believe silicon-based timing solutions are well-suited to optimize footprint, reliability, and power consumption of the overall system within IoT and mobile devices.
 Aerospace and Defense
 Timing devices used in aerospace and defense applications such as rockets and satellites need to withstand extreme vibration forces and temperature gradients during operation. Quartz-based solutions can be impacted by vibrating forces acting on the whole system. MEMS timing devices are well-suited for these applications, as they provide up to 40 times better stability under vibration than comparable quartz-based solutions.

Based on the sell-through information provided to us from distributors and resellers who identify end customers, we believe that the majority of our products sold to Pernas and Quantek are in turn incorporated into products of Apple Inc. (“Apple”), our largest end customer. As a result, we believe revenue attributable to our largest end customer accounted for approximately 40% and 35% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
 Sales and Marketing
 Our customers’ design cycle from initial engagement to volume shipment typically ranges from six months to three years, with product life cycles of up to ten years or more. For many of our products, early engagement with our customers’ technical staff is critical for success. To ensure an adequate level of early engagement, our sales, marketing, and customer and development engineers work closely with our customers and channel partners to understand, identify, and propose solutions to their systems’ challenges. We work closely with our customers, including technology leaders such as Nokia for the communications markets, to anticipate end customer market needs. In some cases, we work with our end customers to better understand the end customers’ market trends and new requirements that are being placed on our customers.
 We sell our products worldwide through multiple channels, including our direct sales force and a network of distributors, contract manufacturers, contracted sales representatives, resellers, and independent design houses. Our global sales strategy includes direct sales and distributors covering over 10,000 end customer accounts since inception.
 We have a strategic accounts strategy with dedicated account owners and our direct sales force focused on key decision-makers to provide high-value solutions for unique customer requirements. We intend to continue to expand our sales and marketing efforts through increased collaboration with our distributors, resellers, and contracted sales representatives. In addition, we intend to introduce a self-service web portal, which will support 24/7 availability and leverage an inside sales team to support a “self-service model” for customers.
 We promote our products and brand through various means including digital marketing and online advertising, press releases, contributed articles, speaking opportunities, trade events, customer events, public relations and industry analyst relations.
 Seasonality
 Our revenue is subject to some seasonal variation.  Based on the production schedules of key customers, our products typically see stronger revenue in the second half of our fiscal year. However, there can be no assurance that this trend will continue.
Manufacturing
 We operate a fabless business model and use third-party foundries and assembly and test contractors to manufacture, assemble and test our semiconductor products. This outsourced manufacturing approach allows us to focus our resources on the design, sale, and marketing of our products. In addition, we believe that outsourcing many of our manufacturing and assembly activities provides us with the flexibility needed to respond to new market opportunities and scale for customer demand, simplifies our operations, and significantly reduces our capital commitments.
 10


We subject our third-party manufacturing contractors to rigorous qualification requirements to meet the high quality and reliability standards required of our products. We carefully qualify each of our partners and their processes before applying the technology to our products. Our engineers work closely with our foundries and other contractors to increase yield, lower manufacturing costs, and improve product quality.
  
• | Fabrication. We currently utilize a range of semiconductor process generations to develop and manufacture our products. We use Robert Bosch LLC (“Bosch”) in Germany and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (“TSMC”) in Taiwan as our primary foundries and suppliers for our MEMS timing devices and analog mixed-signal circuit ICs, respectively.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Package, Assembly and Testing. Upon the completion of processing at the foundry, we use third-party contractors for packaging, assembly and testing, including Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, Inc. (“ASE”), Carsem (M) Sdn Bhd. (“Carsem”), and United Test and Assembly Center Ltd. (“UTAC”) in Taiwan, Malaysia, and Thailand, respectively, as well as Daishinku Corp. (“Daishinku”) and UTAC for ceramic packaging for some of our products.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Warehousing. Our products are warehoused at our outsourced semiconductor assembly and test facilities located in Malaysia, Taiwan, and Thailand.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We have a supply agreement with Bosch under which Bosch has agreed to fabricate our MEMS wafers based on purchase orders placed by us. Bosch has discretion whether to accept our purchase orders, and we can terminate purchase orders for convenience by giving written notice prior to shipment. The initial term of the supply agreement is for ten years through February 2027 and automatically renews unless terminated by either party with three years’ advance notice beginning in February 2024. Other than Bosch, we do not have long-term supply agreements with most of our third-party manufacturing contractors, and we purchase products on a purchase order basis. 
 Research and Development
 We believe that our future success depends on our ability to introduce enhancements on our existing products and to develop new products for both existing and new markets. As a result, a significant majority of our operating expenses has been allocated towards this effort. Our research and development efforts are focused primarily on MEMS and advanced clock IC design and advanced system-level integration for timing solutions.
 We have assembled a core team of experienced engineers and systems designers who conduct research and development activities in the United States, the Netherlands, Japan and Ukraine. As of December 31, 2020, we had 86 engineers worldwide (representing approximately 46% of our total employee base). 
 Intellectual Property
 We rely primarily on patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements, and other contractual protections, to protect our technologies and proprietary know-how. As of December 31, 2020, we had 73 issued U.S. patents, expiring generally between 2026 and 2039, and 27 pending U.S. patent applications. We also had one foreign issued patent expiring in 2039 and four pending foreign patent applications. Our issued patents and pending patent applications generally relate to our MEMS fabrication process, MEMS resonators, circuits, packaging, and oscillator systems.
 In addition to our own intellectual property, we also use third-party licenses for certain technologies embedded in our MEMS solutions. For example, we have a license to certain patents from Bosch relating to the design and manufacture of MEMS-based timing applications. The patent rights obtained under the license agreement expire between 2021 and 2029, and the license agreement expires upon expiration of the last patent licensed under the agreement. If we were to lose the benefit of these patents or other licensed technology used in our business, it could harm our business and our ability to compete.
 We generally control access to and use of our confidential information and trade secrets through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, and customers. We rely in 
 11


part on the laws of the United States and international laws to protect our work. All employees and consultants are required to execute confidentiality agreements in connection with their employment and consulting relationships with us. We also require them to agree to disclose and assign to us all inventions conceived or made in connection with the employment or consulting relationship. However, we cannot guarantee that we have entered into such agreements with every such party and we may not have adequate remedies in case of a breach of any such agreements. Our trade secrets could be disclosed to our competitors or others may independently develop substantially equivalent technologies or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets. Trade secrets can be difficult to protect and some courts inside and outside of the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may still copy, misappropriate, or otherwise obtain and use our software, technology, or other information that we regard as our proprietary intellectual property. In addition, we intend to expand our international operations, and effective patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret, and other intellectual property protection may not be available or may be limited in some foreign countries.
 The semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights and positions, which has resulted in protracted and expensive litigation for many companies. We have in the past received, and we may in the future receive, communications alleging liability for damages or challenging the validity of our intellectual property or proprietary rights. For example, in March 2019, VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, Ltd. filed suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California alleging infringement by us of a U.S. patent. Any litigation, regardless of success or merit, could cause us to incur substantial expenses, reduce our sales, and divert the efforts of our management and other personnel. In the event we receive an adverse result in any litigation, we could be required to pay substantial damages, seek licenses from third parties, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all, cease sale of products, expend significant resources to develop alternative technology, or discontinue the use of processes requiring the relevant technology.
 Competition
 The global semiconductor market in general, and the timing market in particular, is highly competitive. We compete in different target markets based on a number of competitive factors. We expect competition to increase and intensify as additional companies enter our markets and as internal resources of large original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) grow. Increased competition could result in price pressure, reduced gross margins, and loss of market share, any of which could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
 Our competitors range from large, international companies offering a wide range of timing products to smaller companies specializing in narrow market verticals. In the MEMS-based oscillator market, we primarily compete against Microchip Technology Inc. (“MCHP”) through their acquisition of Micrel, Incorporated. In the MEMS-based resonator market, we primarily compete against Murata Manufacturing Co., Ltd. In the analog mixed-signal IC and clocking market, we primarily compete against Renesas Electronics Corporation (through their acquisition of Integrated Device Technology, Inc.), Silicon Laboratories Inc., Texas Instruments Incorporated, Micrel (which is owned by MCHP), and Analog Devices, Inc. In the oscillator market, we primarily compete against quartz crystal suppliers such as Rakon Limited, Daishinku Corporation, Nihon Dempa Kogyo Co., Ltd., TXC Corporation, Seiko Epson Corporation, Kyocera Corporation and Vectron International (which is owned by MCHP). These quartz crystal suppliers typically own their own quartz manufacturing facilities.
 Our ability to compete successfully depends on elements both within and outside of our control, including industry and general economic trends. During past periods of downturns in our industry, competition in the markets in which we operate intensified as our customers reduced their purchase orders. Many of our competitors are substantially larger, have greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution, customer support, and other resources, are more established than we are, and have significantly better brand recognition and broader product offerings which may enable them to better withstand similar adverse economic or market conditions in the future. Any such development may materially and adversely affect our current and future target markets and our ability to compete successfully in those markets. We maintain our competitive position through our ability to successfully design, develop, and market complex timing solutions for the customers we serve.

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the majority of our employees are working from home. We have implemented additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work. We believe we have been able to preserve our business continuity without sacrificing our commitment to keeping our employees safe during the COVID-19 pandemic.
 We regularly review our employees and assess the needs of the business to identify our talent needs. We encourage all employees to continue learning and provide internal opportunities for cross functional work to support this. We regularly review succession plans and focus on promoting internal talent to help grow our employees' careers.
 We conducted a survey in fiscal 2020 and had a participation rate of over 80% of all our employees and the survey results indicated that we excel in areas including initiative, empowerment, opportunities to learn and grow and overall culture. 
 As of December 31, 2020, we had 187 full-time equivalent employees located in the United States, France, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Taiwan, Japan and Ukraine, including 99 in research and development, 69 in sales, general and administrative, and 19 in operations. We consider relations with our employees to be good and have never experienced a work stoppage. None of our employees are either represented by a labor union or subject to a collective bargaining agreement.
