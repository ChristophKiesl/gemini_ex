ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS 
 Ampco-Pittsburgh Corporation (the Corporation) was incorporated in Pennsylvania in 1929. The Corporation, individually or together with its consolidated subsidiaries, is also referred to herein as the Registrant. The Corporation classifies its businesses in two segments: Forged and Cast Engineered Products and Air and Liquid Processing. 
 On March 3, 2016, the Corporation acquired the stock of Åkers AB and certain of its affiliated companies, including Åkers ABs 60% equity interest in a Chinese joint venture company (collectively, Åkers) from Altor Fund II GP Limited. The acquired companies, now part of the Forged and Cast Engineered Products segment, added roll production facilities in Sweden, the United States, Slovenia, and China, a number of sales offices, and a service capability in the United States. The acquisition enables cast roll production in the United States, forged roll production in Europe, and a low-cost product alternative for customers. 
 On November 1, 2016, the Corporation acquired the stock of ASW Steel Inc. (ASW), a premier specialty steel producer based in Welland, Ontario, Canada, from CK Pearl Fund, Ltd., CK Pearl Fund LP, and White Oak Strategic Master Fund, L.P. The acquisition provides the Forged and Cast Engineered Products segment of the Corporation with the capabilities to manufacture the additional chemistries needed to expand the reach into the open-die forging market. 
 FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT SEGMENTS 
 The sales and operating results of the Corporations two segments and the identifiable assets attributable to both segments for the three years ended December 31, 2016 are set forth in Note 21 (Business Segments) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 
 Forged and Cast Engineered Products Segment 
 Union Electric Steel Corporation produces ingot and forged products that service a wide variety of industries globally. It specializes in the production of forged hardened steel rolls used in cold rolling by producers of steel, aluminum and other metals throughout the world. In addition, it produces ingot and open-die forged products which are used in the oil and gas industry and the aluminum and plastic extrusion industries. Although currently representing a minor portion of the segments business activity, sales of ingot and open-die forged products are expected to grow and become a more significant portion of this segments business activity. Union Electric Steel Corporation is headquartered in Carnegie, Pennsylvania with three manufacturing facilities in Pennsylvania, one in Indiana and one in Ohio. It is one of the largest producers of forged hardened steel rolls in the world. In addition to a few domestic competitors, several major European, South American and Asian

 manufacturers also compete in both the domestic and foreign markets. In 2007, a subsidiary of Union Electric Steel Corporation became a 49% partner in a joint venture in China to manufacture large forged backup rolls, principally in weights and sizes larger than those which can be made in the subsidiarys facilities in the United States. In 2016, the ownership interest in the joint venture was reduced to 33%. 
 Union Electric Steel UK Limited produces cast rolls for hot and cold strip mills, medium/heavy section mills and plate mills in a variety of iron and steel qualities. It is located in Gateshead, England and is a major supplier of cast rolls to the metalworking industry worldwide. It primarily competes with European, Asian and North and South American companies in both the domestic and foreign markets. Union Electric Steel UK Limited is a 24% partner in a Chinese joint venture which produces cast rolls. 
 The following entities became indirect subsidiaries of Union Electric Steel Corporation as a result of the acquisition of the Åkers Group: 
 Åkers Sweden AB produces cast rolls for hot strip finishing, roughing mills and plate mills and medium/heavy section mills in a variety of iron and steel qualities. It is located in Åkers Styckebruk, Sweden. 
 Åkers Valji Ravne d.o.o. produces forged rolls for cluster mills and Z-Hi mills, work rolls for narrow and wide strip and aluminum mills, back-up rolls for narrow strip mills, as well as leveling rolls and shafts. It is located in Ravne, Slovenia. 
 Shanxi Åkers TISCO Roll Co. Ltd., is a joint venture between TISCO and Åkers AB in which Åkers AB holds a 60% interest that produces cast hot strip mill work rolls. It is located in Taiyuan, Shanxi Province, China.

 In November of 2016, a subsidiary of Union Electric Steel Corporation acquired ASW, a premier specialty steel producer, located in Welland, Ontario, Canada. 
 Air and Liquid Processing Segment 
 Aerofin Division of Air & Liquid Systems Corporation produces custom-engineered finned tube heat exchange coils and related heat transfer products for a variety of industries including fossil fuel and nuclear power generation, automotive, industrial process and HVAC, and is located in Lynchburg, Virginia. 
 Buffalo Air Handling Division of Air & Liquid Systems Corporation produces large custom air handling systems used in commercial, institutional and industrial buildings and is located in Amherst, Virginia. 
 Buffalo Pumps Division of Air & Liquid Systems Corporation manufactures a line of centrifugal pumps for the refrigeration, power generation and marine defense industries and is located in North Tonawanda, New York. 
 All three of the divisions in this segment are principally represented by a common independent sales organization and have several major competitors. 
 In both segments, the products are dependent on engineering, principally custom designed, and are sold to sophisticated commercial and industrial users located throughout the world. 
 The Forged and Cast Engineered Products segment has two international customers which constituted approximately 24% of its sales in 2016. Additionally, the Air and Liquid Processing segment has a customer which constituted approximately 10% of its sales in 2016. The loss of both of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the respective segments.

Raw Materials 
 Raw materials used in both segments are generally available from many sources and neither segment is dependent upon any single supplier for any raw material. Substantial volumes of raw materials used by each segment are subject to significant variations in price. The Corporations subsidiaries generally do not purchase or commit for the purchase of a major portion of raw materials significantly in advance of the time they require such materials but do make forward commitments for the supply of natural gas and certain commodities (copper and aluminum). See Note 13 (Derivative Instruments) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Patents and Trademarks 
 While the Corporation and its subsidiaries hold some patents, trademarks and licenses, in the opinion of management they are not material to either segment. 
 Backlog 
 The backlog of orders at December 31, 2016 was approximately $234 million compared to a backlog of $142 million at year-end 2015. Approximately 5% of the backlog is expected to be released after 2017. 
Competition 
 The Corporation faces considerable competition from a large number of companies in both segments. The Corporation believes, however, that its subsidiaries are significant factors in each of the niche markets which they serve. Competition in both segments is based on quality, service, price and delivery. For additional information, see Part I, Item 1 General Development of Business of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Research and Development 
 As part of an overall strategy to develop new markets and maintain a leadership position in each of the industry niches served, the Corporations subsidiaries in both segments incur expenditures for research and development. The activities that are undertaken are designed to develop new products, improve existing products and processes, enhance product quality, adapt products to meet customer specifications and reduce manufacturing costs. In the aggregate, these expenditures approximated $2.72 million in 2016, $1.14 million in 2015 and $1.33 million in 2014. 
Environmental Protection Compliance Costs 
 Expenditures for environmental control matters were not material to either segment in 2016 and are expected to approximate $2 million in 2017. 
 Employees 
 On December 31, 2016, the Corporation and its subsidiaries had 1,915 active employees.
