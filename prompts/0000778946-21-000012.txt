Item 1. Business.
Our Business

We are a leading vacation ownership company that markets and sells VOIs and manages resorts in popular leisure and urban destinations. Our resort network includes 45 Club Resorts (resorts in which owners in the Bluegreen Vacation Club (“Vacation Club”) have the right to use most of the units in connection with their VOI ownership) and 23 Club Associate Resorts (resorts in which owners in our Vacation Club have the right to use only a limited number of units in connection with their VOI ownership). Our Club Resorts and Club Associate Resorts are primarily located in high-volume, “drive-to” vacation locations, including Orlando, Las Vegas, Myrtle Beach, Charleston and New Orleans, among others. Through our points-based system, the approximately 218,000 owners in our Vacation Club have the flexibility to stay at units available at any of our resorts and have access to nearly 11,300 other hotels and resorts through partnerships and exchange networks. We have a robust sales and marketing platform supported by marketing relationships with nationally-recognized consumer brands, such as Bass Pro and Choice Hotels. These marketing relationships are intended to drive sales within our core demographic, which is described below.

Prior to 2009, our vacation ownership business consisted solely of the sale of VOIs in resorts that we had developed or acquired (“developed VOI sales”). While we continue to conduct such sales and development activities, we also derive a significant portion of our revenue from our capital-light business model, with the goal of utilizing our expertise and infrastructure to generate both VOI sales and recurring revenue from third parties without the significant capital investment generally associated with the development and acquisition of resorts. Our capital-light business activities include sales of VOIs owned by third-party developers pursuant to which we are paid a commission (“fee-based sales”) and sales of VOIs that we purchase under just-in-time (“JIT”) arrangements with third-party developers or from secondary market sources. In addition, we provide resorts and resort developers with other fee-based services, including resort management, mortgage servicing, title services and construction management. We also offer financing to qualified VOI purchasers, which generates significant interest income. 



(1)Excludes “Other Income, Net”.

Our Vacation Club has grown from approximately 170,000 owners as of December 31, 2012 to approximately 218,000 owners as of December 31, 2020. The typical Vacation Club owner is 48 years old and has an average annual household income of approximately $81,000. According to U.S. census data, households with an annual income of $50,000 to $100,000 represents approximately 29% of the total population. We believe our ability to effectively scale our transaction size to suit our customer, as well as our high-quality, conveniently-located, “drive-to” resorts are key to attracting our core target demographic. 
Our History

We were organized in 1985 as a Massachusetts corporation named Patten Corporation, primarily focused on retail land sales to consumers. In 1994, we entered into the vacation ownership industry. In 1996, we changed our name to Bluegreen Corporation. From 1986 through April 2, 2013, our common stock was publicly listed and traded on the NYSE. On April 2, 2013, Woodbridge Holdings Corporation (“Woodbridge”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Bluegreen Vacations Holding Corporation (NYSE: BVH) (“BVH”), formerly BBX Capital Corporation, acquired all of the shares of our common stock not previously owned by it, and we became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Woodbridge. On March 10, 2014, we were redomiciled from a Massachusetts corporation to a Florida corporation. On September 25, 2017, we changed our name to Bluegreen Vacations Corporation. On November 17, 2017, we consummated an initial public offering of our common stock. Our common stock trades on the NYSE under the symbol “BXG.” BVH owns approximately 93% of our issued and outstanding common stock. BVH is a Florida-based publicly traded holding company.
Our Reportable Segments

We report our results of operations through two reportable segments: (i) Sales of VOIs and financing; and (ii) resort operations and club management. 

Our sales of VOIs and financing segment includes our marketing and sales activities related to the VOIs that we own, our VOIs we acquire under just-in-time and secondary market inventory arrangements, our sales of VOIs through fee based service arrangements with third-party developers, our consumer financing activities in connection with sales of VOIs that we own, and our title services operations through a wholly-owned subsidiary.


Our resort operations and club management segment includes our provision of management services for the Vacation Club and for a majority of the homeowners associations (“HOAs”) of the resorts within our Vacation Club. In connection with those services, we also provide reservation services, accounting services and billing and collections services to our Vacation Club and certain HOAs. Additionally, we generate revenue within our resort operations and club management segment from our Traveler Plus program, food and beverage and other retail operations, our third-party rental services activities, and the management of construction activities of certain of our fee-based clients.

See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 17: Segment Reporting to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our reportable segments.

Products

Vacation Ownership Interests

Since entering the vacation ownership industry in 1994, we have generated over 733,000 VOI sales transactions, including over 181,000 fee-based sales transactions. Our Vacation Club owners receive an annual or biennial allotment of “points” in perpetuity (supported by an underlying deeded VOI held in trust for the owner) that may be used to stay at any of our 45 Club Resorts and 23 Club Associate Resorts. Vacation Club owners can use their points to stay in resorts for varying lengths of time, starting at a minimum of two nights. The number of points required for a stay at a resort depends on a variety of factors, including resort location, size of the unit, vacation season and the days of the week. Under this system, Vacation Club owners can select vacations according to their schedules, space needs and available points. Subject to certain restrictions and fees, Vacation Club owners are typically allowed to carry over any unused points for one year and to “borrow” points from the next year.

Each of our Club Resorts and Club Associate Resorts is managed by an HOA, which is governed by a board of directors or trustees. The board hires a management company to which it delegates many of the rights and responsibilities of the HOA, including landscaping, security, housekeeping, garbage collection, utilities, insurance procurement, laundry and repairs and maintenance. Vacation Club owners pay annual maintenance fees which cover the costs of operating all of the resorts in the Vacation Club system, including fees for real estate taxes and reserves for capital improvements. If a Vacation Club owner does not pay such charges, his or her use rights may be suspended and ultimately terminated, subject to the applicable lender’s first mortgage lien, if any, on such owner’s VOI. We provide management services to 49 resorts and the Vacation Club through contractual arrangements with HOAs. We have a 100% renewal rate on management contracts from our Club Resorts.

Our Vacation Club’s points-based platform offers owners significant flexibility. As reflected in the chart below, basic Vacation Club ownership entitles owners to use their points to stay at any of our 45 Club Resorts and 23 Club Associate Resorts, as well as to access more than 4,200 resorts available through the Resort Condominiums International, LLC (“RCI”) exchange network. For a nominal annual fee and transaction fees, Vacation Club owners can join and utilize our Traveler Plus program, which enables them to use their points to access an additional 44 direct exchange resorts, and other vacation experiences. Vacation Club owners can convert their Vacation Club points into Choice Privileges points, which can be used for stays in Choice Hotels’ properties. In addition, Traveler Plus members can directly use their Vacation Club points for stays in Choice Hotels’ Ascend Hotel Collection properties, a network of historic and boutique hotels located in the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia and Latin America. Overall, there are more than 7,100 hotels in the Choice Hotels network, located in over 40 countries and territories, and Choice Hotels’ brands include the Ascend Hotel Collection, Comfort Inn, Comfort Suites, Quality, Sleep Inn, Clarion, Clarion Pointe, Cambria Hotels and Suites, MainStay Suites, Suburban Extended Stay Hotel, Econo Lodge, Rodeway Inn, WoodSpring Suites and Everhome Suites. We continuously seek new ways to provide value to our Vacation Club owners, including enhanced product offerings, new resort locations, broader vacation experiences and further technological innovation, all of which are designed to increase guest satisfaction


Approximately 64% of Vacation Club owners were enrolled in Traveler Plus as of December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 4% of Vacation Club owners utilized the RCI exchange network. Historically, the owner utilization of RCI has been between 4% and 7%.

Vacation Club Resort Locations 

As shown in the map below, our Vacation Club resorts are primarily located on the U.S. East Coast and Midwest. The 44 direct-exchange resorts available to Traveler Plus members are concentrated along the West Coast and Hawaii. We believe that, together, this provides a broad geographic offering of resorts available to our Vacation Club owners.





Vacation Club resorts are primarily “drive-to” resort destinations as approximately 88% of our Vacation Club owners live within a four-hour drive of at least one resort. Our resorts are generally located in popular vacation destinations, such as Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, Texas, Louisiana, and Nevada, and represent a diverse mix of resort and urban destinations, allowing Vacation Club owners the ability to customize their vacation experience. 

Our resort network also offers a diverse mix of experiences and accommodations. Unlike some of our competitors that maintain static brand design standards across resorts and geographies, we seek to design resorts that capture the uniqueness of a particular location. The goal of our resorts offer authentic experience and connection to the resorts’ unique and varied locations.

Our resorts typically feature condominium-style accommodations with amenities such as fully equipped kitchens, entertainment centers and in-room laundry appliances. Many resorts feature a clubhouse (including a pool, game room, and lounge), hotel-type staff and concierge services.

We also own a 51% interest in Bluegreen/Big Cedar Vacations, which develops, markets and sells VOIs at three premier wilderness-themed resorts adjacent to Table Rock Lake near Branson, Missouri: The Bluegreen Wilderness Club at Big Cedar, The Cliffs at Long Creek and Paradise Point. The remaining 49% interest in Bluegreen/Big Cedar Vacations is held by Big Cedar, LLC (“BC LLC”), an affiliate of Bass Pro. As a result of our controlling interest in Bluegreen/Big Cedar Vacations, our consolidated financial statements include the results of operations and financial condition of Bluegreen/Big Cedar Vacations.

Marketing and Sale of Inventory

VOI sales are typically generated by attracting prospective customers to tour a resort and attend a sales presentation. Our sales and marketing platforms utilize a variety of methods to attract prospective customers, drive tour flow and sell VOIs in our Vacation Club. We primarily utilize marketing alliances with nationally-recognized brands, which provide access to venues which target consumers generally matching our core demographic. In addition, sales prospects are sourced through programs which generate leads at high-traffic venues and in high-density tourist locations and events, as well as through telemarketing and referrals from existing owners and other guests at our properties.

While in the past historical performance provided a basis for estimating VOI sales based on packages sold, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, this has not been the case as purchasers of packages have not traveled to the same extent as they did previously pre-pandemic.

Many of our marketing programs intended to attract new customers involve the sale of a discounted vacation package that typically includes a two to three night stay in close proximity to one of our resort sales offices and requires participation in a sales presentation (a sales tour). Vacation packages are typically sold either in retail brick and mortar establishments, such as Bass Pro and Cabela’s stores and malls, through our call transfer program with Choice, or via telemarketing. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold approximately 132,000 vacation packages and 19% 


of our VOI sales were made to customers who had previously purchased a vacation package and attended a sales presentation. As of December 31, 2020, we had a pipeline of over 121,000 vacation packages sold to prospective new customers. In addition, we had a pipeline of nearly 15,000 vacation packages that were purchased by customers who already toured and indicated that they intend to tour again.

Bluegreen Vacations Unlimited (“BVU”), our wholly-owned subsidiary, has an exclusive marketing agreement with Bass Pro, a nationally-recognized retailer of fishing, marine, hunting, camping and sports gear, that provides us with the right to market and sell vacation packages at kiosks in Bass Pro’s and Cabela’s retail locations and through other means. We believe that Bass Pro has a loyal customer base that strongly matches our core demographic. 

During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, VOI sales to prospects and leads generated by the agreement with Bass Pro accounted for approximately 12%, 13% and 14%, respectively, of our VOI sales volume. As of December 31, 2019, we had sales and marketing operations at a total of 83 Bass Pro and Cabela’s Stores. In March 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we temporarily closed our retail marketing operations at Bass Pro and Cabela’s stores. Beginning in mid-May 2020, we started the process of recommencing our sales and marketing operations and by December 31, 2020, we were operating in a total of 98 Bass Pro and Cabela’s stores.

We also have an exclusive strategic relationship with Choice Hotels that involves several areas of our business, including a sales and marketing alliance that enables us to leverage Choice Hotels’ brands, customer relationships and marketing channels to sell vacation packages. Vacation packages are sold through customer reservation calls transferred to us from Choice Hotels and through outbound telemarketing methods utilizing Choice Hotels customer database. Our strategic relationship with Choice Hotels began in 2013 and was extended in August 2017 for a 15 year term, with an additional 15-year renewal term thereafter unless either party elects not to renew the arrangement.

We believe that our diverse strategic marketing alliances (including those with Bass Pro, Choice Hotels and other retail operators and entertainment providers) provides a potential strategic advantage over certain of our competitors that rely primarily on relationships with their affiliated hotel brands to drive lead generation and new owner growth. Our goal is to identify marketing partners with brands that attract our targeted owner demographic and to build successful marketing relationships with those partners. In addition to the programs described above, we may also engage in other local and national marketing programs from time to time. 

In addition to sales to new customers, we also seek to sell additional VOI points to our existing Vacation Club owners. These sales generally have lower marketing costs and result in higher operating margins than sales generated through other marketing channels. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, sales to existing Vacation Club owners accounted for 64%, 55% and 52%, respectively, of our system-wide sales of VOIs. We target a balanced mix of new customer and existing Vacation Club owner sales to support our goal of sustainable long-term growth. We believe that the variety in our marketing relationships has historically facilitated a healthy mix of new owner sales vs. existing owner sales that compare favorably to our competitors. 

We operate 24 sales offices, typically located adjacent to our resorts and staffed with sales representatives and sales managers. As of December 31, 2020, we had over 2,400 employees dedicated to VOI sales and marketing. We typically utilize a uniform sales process and offer ongoing training for our sales personnel with the goal of maintaining strict quality control policies. During the year ended December 31, 2020, 97% of our sales were generated from 20 of our sales offices which focus on both new customer and existing Vacation Club owner sales. Our remaining 4 sales offices are primarily focused on sales to existing Vacation Club owners staying at the respective resort. We also utilize our telesales operations to sell additional VOIs to Vacation Club owners. 

Flexible Business Model

Our business model is designed to give us potential flexibility to capitalize on opportunities and adapt to changing market environments. We have the ability to adjust our targeted mix of capital-light vs. developed VOI sales, sales to new customers vs. existing Vacation Club owners, and cash vs. financed sales. While we may pursue opportunities that impact our short-term results, our long-term goal is to achieve sustained growth while maximizing earnings and cash flow. 





Note: Cash sales represent the portion of our system-wide sales of VOIs that is received from the customer in cash within 30 days of purchase.

VOI Sales Mix

Our VOI sales include:

Developed VOI sales, or sales of VOIs in resorts that we develop or acquire (excluding inventory acquired pursuant to JIT and secondary market arrangements);
Fee-based sales of VOIs owned by third-party developers pursuant to which we are paid a commission;
JIT sales of VOIs we acquire from third-party developers in close proximity to when we intend to sell such VOIs; and
Secondary market sales of VOIs we acquire from HOAs or other owners.

During 2020, sales of VOIs were comprised of the following: 


Developed VOI Sales

Developed VOI sales are sales of VOIs in resorts that we have developed or acquired (excluding inventory acquired pursuant to JIT and secondary market arrangements). During the year ended December 31, 2020, developed VOI sales accounted for 33% of our system-wide sales of VOIs. We hold the notes receivable originated in connection with developed VOI sales. We also typically hold the HOA management contract associated with these resorts.

Fee-Based Sales

We offer sales and marketing services to third-party developers for a commission. Under these fee-based sales arrangements, which are typically entered into on a non-committed basis, we sell the third-party developers’ VOIs as Vacation Club interests through our sales and marketing platform. We also provide third-party developers with administrative services, periodic reporting and analytics through our proprietary software platform. We seek to structure the fee for these services to cover selling and marketing costs, plus an operating profit. Historically we have targeted a commission rate of 65% to 75% of the VOI sales price. Fee-Based Sales comprised 37% of system-wide sales of VOIs during the year ended December 31, 2020. Notes receivable originated in connection with fee-based sales are held by the third-party developer and, in certain cases, are serviced by us for an additional fee. In connection with fee-based sales, we are not at risk for development financing and have no capital requirements, thereby increasing return on invested capital, or ROIC. We also typically hold the HOA management contract associated with these resorts.

Just-In-Time (JIT) VOI Sales

We enter into JIT inventory acquisition agreements with third-party developers that allow us to buy VOI inventory in close proximity to when we intend to sell such VOIs. While we typically enter into such arrangements on a non-committed basis, we may engage in committed arrangements under certain circumstances. Similar to fee-based sales, JIT sales do not expose us to risk for development financing. However, unlike fee-based sales, we hold the consumer finance receivables originated in connection with JIT sales. While JIT sales accounted for only 7% of system-wide sales of VOIs for the year ended December 31, 2020, JIT arrangements are often entered into in connection with fee-based sales arrangements. In general, acquisition of VOI inventory through JIT segments are at a higher cost compared to developed VOIs of secondary market sources. We also typically hold the HOA management contract associated with these resorts.

Secondary Market VOI Sales

We acquire VOI inventory from HOAs and other owners generally on a non-committed basis. These VOIs are typically obtained by the applicable HOA through foreclosure or termination in connection with HOA maintenance fee defaults or from charities from which a consumer has donated their VOI. In these cases, we generally purchase VOIs from secondary market sources at significant discount to retail price. During the year ended December 31, 2020, secondary market sales accounted for 23% of our system-wide sales of VOIs.
Future VOI Sales 

The retail value of our completed VOI inventory increases or decreases from period to period due to the acquisition of inventory through JIT and secondary market arrangements, development of new VOI units, reacquisition of VOIs through notes receivable defaults and changes to sales prices and completed sales. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we owned completed VOI inventory (excluding units not currently being marketed as VOIs, such as model units) and had access to additional completed VOI inventory through fee-based and JIT arrangements having a retail sales value as follows (dollars are in thousands and represent the then-estimated retail sales value): 

 | As of December 31,
Inventory Source | 2020 | | 2019
Owned completed VOI inventory | $ | 1,111,277 | | $ | 1,115,822
Inventory accessible through fee-based | | | | | 
and JIT arrangements | | 293,056 | | | 312,816 
Total | $ | 1,404,333 | | $ | 1,428,638


Based on current estimates and expectations, we believe this inventory, combined with inventory being developed by us or our third-party developer clients, and inventory that we may reacquire in connection with mortgage and maintenance fee defaults, can support our VOI sales at our current levels for approximately four years. We maintain relationships with numerous third-party developers and expect additional fee-based and JIT relationships to continue to provide VOI inventory to support our sales efforts. In addition, we are focused on strategically expanding our inventory through development at certain of our resorts over the next several years. We intend to continue to strategically evaluate opportunities to develop or acquire VOI inventory in key strategic markets where we identify growing demand and where we currently have or expect to have significant marketing and sales networks.

During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the estimated retail sales value and cash purchase price of the VOIs we acquired through secondary market arrangements were as follows (dollars in thousands): 



 | | Year Ended December 31,
 | | 2020 | | 2019
Estimated retail sales value | ​ | $ | 103,134 | ​ | $ | 228,632
Cash purchase price | ​ | $ | 4,558 | ​ | $ | 15,962 


Active development activities consist primarily of additional VOI units being developed at The Cliffs at Long Creek and The Bluegreen Wilderness Club at Big Cedar in Ridgedale, Missouri. 

Management and Other Fee-Based Services

We earn recurring management fees for providing services to HOAs. These management services include oversight of housekeeping services, maintenance and certain accounting and administrative functions. We believe our management contracts yield highly predictable cash flows that do not have the traditional risks associated with hotel management contracts that are linked to daily rate or occupancy. Our management contracts are typically structured as “cost-plus” management fees, pursuant to which we generally earn fees equal to 10% to 12% of the costs to operate the applicable resort. These agreements generally have an initial term of three years with automatic one year renewals. As of December 31, 2020, we provided management services to 49 resorts. We also earn recurring management fees for providing services to the Vacation Club. These services include managing the reservation system and providing owner billing and collection services. Our management contract with the Vacation Club currently provides for reimbursement of our costs plus a fee equal to $10 per VOI owner. We may seek to expand our management services business, including to provide hospitality management services to hotels for third parties.

In addition to HOA and club management services, we also provide other fee-based services that produce revenue without the significant capital investment generally associated with the development and acquisition of resorts. 



These services include title and escrow services for fees in connection with the closing of VOI sales, servicing notes receivable held by third parties (typically a fee equal to 1.5% of the principal balance of the serviced portfolio), and construction management services for third-party developers (typically fees equal to 4% of the cost of construction of the project). We also receive revenue from retail and food and beverage operations at certain resorts.

Customer Financing

We generally offer qualified purchasers financing for up to 90% of the purchase price of VOIs. The typical financing provides for a term of ten years and a fixed interest rate that is determined by the FICO score of the borrower and the amount of the down payment and existing ownership, is fully amortizing in equal installments, and may be prepaid without penalty. Purchasers may receive an additional 1% discount on the interest rate by participating in our pre-authorized payment plan. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 92% of our serviced VOI notes receivable participated in our pre-authorized payment plan. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the weighted-average interest rate on our VOI notes receivable was 15.0%. 

VOI purchasers are generally required to make a down payment of at least 10% of the sales price. As part of our efforts to manage operating cash flows, we currently incentivize our sales associates to encourage cash sales and higher down payments on financed sales, with a target of 40-45% of the VOI sales price collected in cash. We also promote a point-of-sale credit card program sponsored by a third-party financial institution. As a result of these efforts, we have increased both the percentage of sales that are fully paid in cash and the average down payment on financed sales as compared to historical levels. Including down payments received on financed sales, approximately 42% of our system-wide sales of VOIs during the year ended December 31, 2020 were paid in cash within approximately 30 days from the contract date.

See “Sales/Financing of Receivables” below for additional information regarding our receivable financing activities.

Loan Underwriting

We generally do not originate financing to customers with FICO scores below 575. However, we may provide financing to customers with no FICO score if the customer makes a minimum down payment of 20%. For loans made during 2020, the borrowers’ weighted-average FICO score after a 30-day, “same as cash” period from the point of sale was 725. Further information is set forth in the following table:

FICO Score | Percentage of originated and‎ serviced VOI receivables

Collection Policies

Financed VOI sales originated by us typically utilize a note and mortgage. Collection efforts related to these VOI loans are managed by us. Collectors are incentivized through a performance-based compensation program.

We generally pursue collection efforts with respect to Vacation Club owners with outstanding loans secured by their VOI by mail, telephone and email (as early as 10 days past due). At 30 days past due, we mail a collection letter to the owner if a U.S. resident advising that if the loan is not brought current, the delinquency will be reported to a credit reporting agency. At 60 days past due, we mail a letter to the owner advising that he or she may be prohibited from making future reservations for lodging at a resort. At 90 days past due, we stop the accrual of, and reverse previously accrued but unpaid, interest on the note receivable and typically mail a notice informing the owner that unless the 


delinquency is cured within 30 days, we may terminate the underlying VOI ownership. If an owner fails to bring the account current within the given timeframe, the loan is typically defaulted and the owner’s VOI is terminated. In that case, we mail a final letter, typically at approximately 127 days past due, notifying the owner of the loan default and the termination of his or her beneficial interest in the VOI property. Thereafter, we may seek to resell the VOI to a new purchaser. In certain cases, at our discretion, we may not default the loan and terminate the underlying VOI, in which case the loan would remain delinquent.

Allowance for Loan Losses

We estimate uncollectible VOI notes receivable based on historical amounts for similar VOI notes receivable and do not consider the value of the underlying collateral. We hold large pools of homogeneous VOI notes receivable and assess uncollectibility based on pools of receivables as we do not believe there are significant concentrations of credit risk with any individual counterparty or groups of counterparties. In estimating future loan losses, management does not use a single primary indicator of credit quality, but instead evaluates our VOI notes receivable based upon a combination of factors, including a static pool analysis that incorporates the aging of the respective receivables, default trends, and prepayment rates by origination year, as well as the FICO scores of borrowers.

Substantially all defaulted VOI notes receivable result in the holder of such receivable acquiring the related VOI that secured such receivable, typically soon after default and at little or no cost. The reacquired VOI is then available for resale in the normal course of business.

See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for additional information about the performance of our notes receivable portfolio.

Sales/Financing of Receivables

Our ability to sell or borrow against our VOI notes receivable has historically been an important factor in meeting our liquidity requirements. The vacation ownership business generally involves sales where a buyer is only required to pay 10% of the purchase price up front, while at the same time selling and marketing expenses related to such sales are primarily cash expenses that exceed the down payment amount. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our sales and marketing expenses totaled approximately 59% of system-wide sales of VOIs. Accordingly, having facilities for the sale or hypothecation of VOI notes receivable, along with periodic term securitization transactions, has been a critical factor in meeting our short and long-term cash needs. There are no assurances that sales, hypothecation or securitization of VOIs will be available to us in the future at acceptable terms or at all. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for additional information about our VOI notes receivable purchase facilities and term securitizations.

Receivables Servicing

Receivables servicing includes collecting payments from borrowers and remitting the funds to the owners, lenders or investors in such receivables, accounting for principal and interest on such receivables, making advances when required, contacting delinquent borrowers, terminating a Vacation Club ownership in the event that defaults are not timely remedied and performing other administrative duties.

We receive fees for servicing our securitized notes receivable. These fees are included as a component of interest income. Additionally, we earn servicing fee income from third-party developers in connection with our servicing of their loan portfolios under certain fee-based services arrangements, which is netted against the cost of our mortgage servicing operations.


Our Core Operating and Growth Strategies
Grow VOI sales

Our goal is to utilize our sales and marketing platform to achieve VOI sales growth through the expansion of existing alliances, continued development of new marketing programs and additional VOI sales to our existing Vacation Club owners. We believe there are a number of opportunities within our existing marketing alliances to drive future growth, including the potential expansion of our marketing efforts with Bass Pro. In addition, through our agreement with Choice Hotels, we plan to enhance our marketing program through Choice Hotels’ call-transfer programs. In addition to existing programs, we hope to utilize our sales and marketing expertise to identify unique marketing relationships with nationally-recognized brands that resonate with our core demographic. We will also continue to actively seek to sell additional VOI points to our existing Vacation Club owners, which typically involve significantly lower marketing costs and have higher conversion rates compared to sales to new customers. Our goal continues to be to expand and update our sales offices to more effectively convert tours generated by our marketing programs into sales. To this end, we have focused on identifying high traffic resorts where we believe increased investment in sales office infrastructure will yield strong sales results.

Continue to enhance our Vacation Club experience

We believe our Vacation Club offers owners exceptional value. Our Vacation Club offers owners access to our 45 Club Resorts and 23 Club Associate Resorts in popular vacation destinations, as well as access to nearly 11,300 other hotels and resorts and other vacation experiences, through partnerships and exchange networks. We continue to seek to add value and flexibility to our Vacation Club membership and enhance the vacation experience of our Vacation Club owners, including through the addition of new destinations, the expansion of our exchange programs and the addition of new partnerships offering increased vacation options. We also continuously seek to improve our technology, including websites and applications, to enhance our Vacation Club owners’ experiences. We believe our focus, combined with our high-quality customer service, will continue to enhance the Vacation Club experience, supporting our objective to entice guests to vacation and drive sales to new owners and additional sales to existing Vacation Club owners.

Increase higher-margin, cash generating businesses

We seek to continue to grow our ancillary businesses, including resort management, title services and loan servicing. We believe these businesses can grow with little additional investment in infrastructure and potentially produce higher-margin revenue.

Increase sales and operating efficiencies across all customer touch-points

We actively seek to improve our operational execution across all aspects of our business. In our sales and marketing platform, we utilize a variety of screening methods and data-driven analyses intended to identify and attract high-quality prospects to our sales offices We intend to seek to leverage our size, infrastructure and expertise to increase operating efficiency and profitability and hope to gain further operational efficiencies by streamlining our support operations, such as call centers, customer service, administration and information technology.

Maintain operational flexibility while growing our business

We believe we have built a flexible business model that allows us to capitalize on opportunities and quickly adapt to changing market environments. We intend to continue to pursue growth through what we believe to be an appropriate mix of capital-light sales vs. developed VOI sales, sales to new customers vs. sales to existing Vacation Club owners and cash sales vs. financed sales, all based on market factors, our financial condition and operating needs, and other factors that our management may deem relevant.


Pursue strategic transactions

As part of our growth strategy, we may seek to acquire other VOI companies, resort assets, sales and marketing platforms, management companies and contracts, and other assets, properties and businesses, particularly where we believe significant synergies and cost savings may be available. These acquisitions may be pursued directly or in partnership with third-party developers or others, including pursuant to arrangements where third-party developers purchase the resort assets and we sell the VOIs in the acquired resort on a commission basis. We believe our flexible sales and marketing platform may make these transactions possible in a variety of economic conditions.

Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic

Initial Impact and Response

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an unprecedented disruption in the U.S. economy and the travel, hospitality and vacation ownership industries due to, among other things, resort closures, travel restrictions and restrictions on business operations, including government guidance and restrictions with respect to travel, public accommodations, social gatherings and related matters. Our operations have been and continue to be adversely impacted by the pandemic. On March 23, 2020, we temporarily closed all of our VOI sales centers, our retail marketing operations at Bass Pro Shops and Cabela’s stores and outlet malls, and our Choice Hotels call transfer program. In connection with these actions we canceled existing owner reservations through May 15, 2020 and new prospect guest tours through June 30, 2020. Further, some of our Club Resorts and Club Associate Resorts were closed in accordance with government mandates and advisories. Beginning in mid-May 2020, we recommenced our sales and marketing operations and our closed resorts began to welcome guests as government mandates were lifted. By December 31, 2020, we were operating in a total of 98 Bass Pro and Cabela’s stores, we reactivated our Choice Hotels call transfer program, all of our resorts were open, and all but two of our VOI sales centers were open. However, there is no assurance that our marketing operations at Bass Pro or Cabela’s stores, or our VOI sales centers will remain open, including in the event of an increase in COVID-19 cases.  Additionally, reflecting our temporary cessation of marketing activities in the beginning months of the COVID-19 pandemic in general, our pipeline of vacation packages was 121,900 at December 31, 2020 compared to 169,300 at December 31, 2019. However, utilization of the packages has been significantly lower as purchasers have not traveled at the same pace as was traveled pre-pandemic. For more detailed information please see “Results of Operations” included in Part II—Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

As a result of the effect of the pandemic, we implemented steps to mitigate our costs beginning in March 2020, including reductions in workforce of over 1,700 positions and the placement of another approximate 3,200 of our associates on temporary furlough or reduced work hours. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 3,200 associates had returned to work on a full-time basis for a total of approximately 4,600 full-time associates compared to approximately 5,900 full-time associates as of December 31, 2019. As a result of the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred $5.0 million in severance and $14.3 million of payroll and payroll benefit expense relating to employees on temporary furlough or reduced work hours. These payments and expenses are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2020. While we paid a special cash dividend of $1.19 per share during August 2020, we suspended the payment of regular quarterly cash dividends during the second quarter of 2020 and there is no assurance that we will recommence paying regular dividends or pay any additional special dividends in the future. 

As a precautionary measure to provide additional liquidity if needed, in March 2020, we drew down $60.0 million under our lines-of-credit and pledged or sold receivables under certain of our receivable backed facilities to increase our cash position. As of December 31, 2020, we repaid the $60.0 million borrowed under our lines-of-credit. Also, in June 2020, we amended our Liberty Bank Facility to extend the advance period and maturity date, reduced the outstanding borrowings from $50.0 million to $40.0 million, decreased the advance rate from 85% for qualified conforming receivables to 80% effective September 2020 and, commencing July 1, 2020, changed the interest rate from the Prime Rate with a floor of 4.00% to the Prime Rate minus 0.10% with a floor of 3.40%. In September 2020, 


we amended our NBA Receivables Facility to extend the advance period and maturity date, decreased the advance rate from 85% for qualified receivables to 80%, and changed the interest rate from one month LIBOR plus 2.75% (with an interest rate floor of 3.50%) to one month LIBOR plus 2.25% (with an interest rate floor of 3.00%). In October 2020, we completed the 2020-A Term Securitization, a private offering and sale of approximately $131.0 million of investment-grade, VOI receivable backed notes (the “Notes”) at an overall blended interest rate of approximately 2.60%. The gross advance rate for this transaction was 88.0% and the Notes mature in February 2036. Proceeds from the 2020-A Term Securitization were used to paydown approximately $82.1 million owed on existing receivable-backed facilities, (thus creating additional availability on those facilities), to capitalize a reserve fund, to pay fees and expenses associated with the transaction, and for general corporate purposes. In December 2020, we amended our Quorum Purchase Facility to extend the advance period from December 2020 to December 2022 and extend the maturity date from December 2032 to December 2034. We continue to actively pursue additional credit facility capacity and capital market transactions. For more detailed information please see “Liquidity and Capital Resources” included in Part II —Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

We have historically provided financing to customers for a majority of our sales of VOIs, and accordingly, are subject to the risk of defaults by our customers. GAAP requires that we reduce sales of VOIs by our estimate of uncollectible VOI notes receivable. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a material adverse impact on unemployment in the United States and economic conditions in general and the impact may continue for some time. We believe that the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to have an impact on the collectibility of our VOI notes receivable.  Accordingly, the estimate of defaults for the 2021 year was increased by approximately $6.0 million, based on historical experience, forbearance requests received from customers, and other factors, including, but not limited to, the seasoning of the notes receivable and FICO scores of the customers. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on default or delinquency rates is rapidly changing and highly uncertain. 

The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Securities Act (“CARES Act”) was signed into law on March 27, 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As of December 31, 2020, we evaluated the income tax provisions of the CARES Act and determined they had no significant effect on the computation of our estimated effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2020. However, we have taken advantage of the deferral of the employer portion of the tax withholding amounts and the employee retention tax credits provided for in the CARES Act. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a tax withholding deferral of $8.6 million and employee retention tax credits of $7.1 million, which is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2020.

Continued Impact of COVID-19 on our Business

We continue to experience lower travel rates especially to high traffic destinations such as Orlando and Las Vegas. The occupancy rates at resorts with sales centers during the fourth quarter of 2020 was approximately 71% as compared to 80% during the fourth quarter of 2019. This trend of reduced travel was also reflected in utilization of vacation packages especially for vacation packages sold prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Industry Overview 

The vacation ownership, or timeshare, industry is a growing segment of the global travel and tourism sector. By purchasing a VOI, the purchaser typically acquires either (i) a fee simple interest in a property (or collection of properties) providing annual usage rights at the owner’s home resort (where the owner’s VOI is deeded), or (ii) an annual or biennial allotment of points that can be redeemed for stays at properties included in the vacation ownership company’s resort network or for other vacation options available through exchange programs. Compared to hotel rooms, vacation ownership units typically offer more spacious floor plans and residential features, such as living rooms, fully equipped kitchens, laundry appliances and dining areas. Compared to owning a vacation home in its entirety, the key advantages of vacation ownership products typically include a lower up-front acquisition cost and annual expenses, resort-style features and services and, often, an established infrastructure to exchange usage rights for stays across multiple locations. 




The vacation ownership industry was historically highly fragmented, with a large number of local and regional resort developers and operators having small resort portfolios of varying quality. We believe that growth in the vacation ownership industry has been driven by increased interest from resort developers and globally-recognized lodging and entertainment brands, increased interest from consumers seeking flexible vacation options, continued product evolution and geographic expansion. Approximately 9.9 million families (approximately 7.7% of U.S. households) own at least one VOI. 

The average VOI owner is 40 years old and married and 81% have either graduated from or attended college. VOI owners have an average household income of over $85,000.

Regulation

The vacation ownership and real estate industries are subject to extensive and complex governmental regulation and as a consequence we are subject to various federal, state, local, foreign, environmental, zoning, consumer protection and other laws, rules and regulations, including those regarding the acquisition, marketing and sale of VOIs, as well as various aspects of our financing operations. At the federal level, the Federal Trade Commission has taken an active regulatory role through the Federal Trade Commission Act, which prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or unfair competition in interstate commerce. In addition, many states have what are known as “Little FTC Acts” that apply to intrastate activity. 

In addition to the laws applicable to our customer financing and other operations discussed below, we are or may be subject to the Fair Housing Act and various other federal laws, rules and regulations. We are also subject to various foreign laws with respect to La Cabana Beach Resort and Casino in Oranjestad, Aruba and Blue Water Resort at Cable Beach in Nassau, Bahamas. The cost of complying with applicable laws and regulations may be significant and while efforts are in place to monitor compliance, those efforts may not at all times be successful. Any failure to comply with current or future applicable laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results and operations. 

The vacation ownership product is subject to various regulatory requirements, including state and local approvals. In most states we are required to file with the jurisdictions a detailed offering statement describing our business and all material aspects of the project and sale of VOIs with the designated state authority. In addition, when required by state law, we provide our VOI purchasers with a public offering disclosure statement that contains, among other items, detailed information about the VOI product and the purchaser’s rights and obligations as a VOI owner. Laws in each state where we sell VOIs generally grant the purchaser of a VOI the right to cancel a purchase contract at any time within a specified rescission period following the earlier of the date the contract was signed or the date the purchaser received the last of the documents required to be provided by us. Most states have other laws that regulate our activities, which may include real estate licensure requirements, sellers of travel licensure requirements, anti-fraud laws, telemarketing laws, prize, gift and sweepstakes laws, and labor laws. 

Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, the owner of real property is generally liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances located on or in, or emanating from, the property, as well as related costs of investigation and property damage. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the property owner knew of the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. The presence of these substances, or the failure to properly remediate these substances, may adversely affect a property owner’s ability to sell or lease a property or to borrow using the real property as collateral. Other federal and state laws require the removal or encapsulation of asbestos-containing material when such material is in poor condition or in the event of construction, demolition, remodeling or renovation. Other statutes may require the removal of underground storage tanks. Noncompliance with any of these and other environmental, health or safety requirements may result in the need to cease or alter operations or development at a property. In addition, certain state and local laws may impose liability on property developers with respect to construction defects discovered on the property or repairs made by future owners of such property. The development, management and operation of our resorts are also subject to the Americans with Disabilities Act. 


Our marketing, sales and customer financing activities are also subject to extensive regulation, which can include, but is not limited to: the Truth-in-Lending Act and Regulation Z; the Fair Housing Act; the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act; the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B; the Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E; the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and Regulation C; the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”); Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices and Regulation AA; the Patriot Act; the Right to Financial Privacy Act; the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act; the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act; and anti-money laundering laws. Pursuant to the Dodd Frank Act, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”) was created. The CFPB’s mandate is to protect consumers by carrying out federal consumer financial laws and to publish rules and forms that facilitate understanding of the financial implications of the transactions consumers enter into. Consistent with this mission, the CFPB amended Regulations X and Z to establish new disclosure requirements and forms pursuant to Regulation Z for most closed-end consumer credit transactions secured by real property. The practical impact upon us is the requirement to use a new Integrated Mortgage Disclosure Statement in lieu of the separate Good Faith Estimate and Closing Statement. In addition, our term securitization transactions must comply with certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act, including risk retention rules. 

Our management of, and dealings with, HOAs, including our purchase of defaulted inventory from HOAs in connection with our secondary market arrangements, is subject to state laws and resort rules and regulations, including those with respect to the establishment of budgets and expenditures, rule-making and the imposition of maintenance assessments. 

During the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 4% of our VOI sales were generated by marketing to prospective purchasers obtained through internal and third-party vendors’ outbound telemarketing efforts. We attempt to monitor the actions and legal and regulatory compliance of these third parties, but there are risks associated with our and such third parties’ telemarketing efforts. In recent years, state and federal regulators have increased regulations and enforcement actions related to telemarketing operations, including requiring the adherence to state “do not call” laws. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission and Federal Communications Commission have implemented national “do not call” legislation. We have attempted to mitigate the risks associated with telemarketing through the use of “permission based marketing,” whereby we obtain the permission of prospective purchasers to contact them in the future, thereby exempting such calls from the various “do not call” laws. We have also implemented policies and procedures that we believe will help reduce the possibility that individuals who have requested to be placed on a “do not call” list are not contacted, but such policies and procedures do not ensure strict regulatory compliance. 

To date, no material fines or penalties have been imposed on us as a result of our telemarketing operations. However, from time to time, we have been the subject of proceedings for violation of the telemarketing laws and other laws applicable to the marketing and sale of VOIs. See “See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II Item 8 for additional information.” 

Competition 

We compete with various high profile and well-established companies, many of which have greater liquidity and financial resources than we do. Many of the world’s most recognized lodging, hospitality and entertainment companies develop and sell VOIs in resort properties. Major companies that now operate vacation ownership resorts directly, through subsidiaries or through strategic relationships include Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corporation, the Walt Disney Company, Hilton Grand Vacations, Travel + Leisure Co. (formerly Wyndham Destinations), and Diamond Resorts International. We also compete with numerous smaller owners and operators of vacation ownership resorts and from alternative lodging options available to consumers through both traditional methods of delivery as well as new web portals and applications, including private rentals of homes, apartments or condominium units, which have increased in popularity in recent years. Our ability to remain competitive and to attract and retain customers depends on our customers’ satisfaction with our products and services as well as on distinguishing the quality, value, and efficiency of our products and services from those offered by our competitors. In our fee-based services business, we typically compete with Hilton Grand Vacations and Travel + Leisure Co. In addition to competing for sales leads, prospects and fee-based service clients, we compete with other VOI developers for marketing, sales and resort management personnel. 
Seasonality 

We have historically experienced, and expect to continue to experience, seasonal fluctuations in our revenue and results of operations. This seasonality has resulted, and may continue to result, in fluctuations in our quarterly operating results. Due to consumer travel patterns, we typically see more tours and experience higher VOI sales during the second and third quarters. However, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the temporary closures of our marketing operations and VOI sales centers, we experienced significantly decreased sales of VOIs in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2020 as compared to prior years and currently expect such adverse impact to continue into 2021. 
Human Resources

As of December 31, 2020, we had 4,637 employees, 458 of whom were located at our headquarters in Boca Raton, Florida, compared to 5,873 and 520 respectively, as of December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, a total of 27 of our employees were covered by two collective bargaining agreements, which address the terms and conditions of their employment, including pay rates, working hours, certain employee benefits and procedures for settlement of labor disputes. We believe that our employee relations are good and our employees are important to achieving our business objectives. 

On March 23, 2020, we temporarily closed all of our VOI sales centers and our marketing operations in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, some of our corporate offices, Club Resorts and Club Associate Resorts were closed in accordance with government mandates and advisories in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. We also commenced remote work protocols for those employees that, based on their position, were capable of working from home. Beginning in mid-May 2020, we started the process of recommencing our sales and marketing operations and our closed resorts began to reopen as government mandates were lifted. Upon reopening, we had COVID-19 prevention protocols designed to minimize the spread of COVID-19 at our resorts and workplaces. These protocols, which remain in place, meet or exceed the Centers for Disease Control guidelines and where applicable, state mandates. We continue to encourage a remote work protocol for portions of the workforce due to the continuing pandemic. Further, we continuously evaluate our operations in light of recent resurgences of COVID-19, federal, state and local guidance, evolving data concerning the pandemic and the best interests of our employees and customers.

Bluegreen seeks to offer competitive compensation and benefit programs for our employees in our effort to attract and retain superior talent. In addition to competitive base wages, additional programs include: Incentive Compensation Plans, Long-Term Incentive Plans, a company matched 401(k) plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, a tuition assistance program, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, and employee assistance programs.

We are committed to foster an inclusive work environment that supports our workforce and the communities we serve. It is our policy to seek to hire the best qualified employees regardless of gender, ethnicity or other protected traits and to fully comply with all laws applicable to discrimination in the workplace. 

Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company 

We qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). As an emerging growth company, we can take advantage of specified reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies, including reduced financial disclosure, reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements, exemption from the requirements to hold non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or shareholder approval of golden parachute payments, and exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. We expect to continue to take advantage of certain of the exemptions available to emerging growth companies until December 31, 2022 (the end of the fifth fiscal year following the completion of the initial public offering of our common stock) or such earlier time that we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company. We would cease to be an emerging growth company if we have more than $1.07 billion in annual revenue, more than $700.0 million in 


market value of our stock is held by non-affiliates, or we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt securities over a three-year period.
