Item 1. Business
OVERVIEW
 
We are a medical device company that is currently focused on bone regeneration in spinal fusion using the recombinant human protein, known as NELL-1/DBX®. The NELL-1/DBX® combination product is an osteostimulative recombinant protein that provides target specific control over bone regeneration. The protein, as part of the UCB-1 technology platform has been licensed exclusively for worldwide applications to us through a technology transfer from University of California Los Angeles (“UCLA”). UCLA and the Company received guidance from the FDA that NELL-1/DBX® will be classified as a combination product with a device lead.
 
The Company was founded by University of California professors in collaboration with an Osaka University professor and a University of Southern California surgeon in 2004 as a privately-held company with proprietary, patented technology that has been validated in sheep and non-human primate models to facilitate bone growth. Our platform technology has application in delivering improved outcomes in the surgical specialties of spinal, orthopedic, general orthopedic, plastic reconstruction, neurosurgery, interventional radiology, and sports medicine. Lead product development and clinical studies are targeted on spinal fusion surgery, one of the larger segments in the orthopedic market.
 
We are a development stage entity. The production and marketing of our products and ongoing research and development activities will be subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the United States. Prior to marketing in the United States, any combination product developed by us must undergo rigorous preclinical (animal) and clinical (human) testing and an extensive regulatory approval process implemented by the FDA under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. There can be no assurance that we will not encounter problems in clinical trials that will cause us or the FDA to delay or suspend the clinical trials.
 
Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents and product license rights, maintain trade secrets, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others, both in the United States and other countries. There can be no assurance that patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, or that the rights granted thereunder will provide proprietary protection or competitive advantages to us.
 
PRODUCTS
 
We have developed a stand-alone platform technology through significant laboratory and small and large animal research over more than ten years to generate the current applications across broad fields of use. The platform technology is our recombinant human protein, known as NELL-1, a proprietary skeletal specific growth factor which is a bone void filler. NELL-1 provides regulation over skeletal tissue formation and stem cell differentiation during bone regeneration. The Company obtained the platform technology pursuant to an exclusive license agreement with UCLA.
 
We are currently focused on bone regeneration in lumbar spinal fusion, in keeping with our exclusive license agreement, using NELL-1 in combination with DBX®, a proprietary demineralized bone matrix from Musculoskeletal Transplant Foundation (“MTF”). The NELL-1/DBX® medical device is a combination product which is an osteostimulative recombinant protein that provides target specific control over bone regeneration. Leveraging the resources of investors and strategic partners, we have successfully surpassed two critical milestones:
 

● | Demonstrating a successful small laboratory scale pilot run for the manufacturing of the recombinant NELL-1 protein in Chinese hamster ovary cells; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Validation of protein dosing and efficacy in established large animal sheep models and non-human primate models.

Our lead product is expected to be purified NELL-1 mixed with 510(k) cleared DBX® Demineralized Bone Putty recommended for use in conjunction with applicable hardware consistent with the indication. The NELL-1/DBX® Fusion Device will be comprised of a single dose vial of NELL-1 recombinant protein freeze dried onto DBX®. A vial of NELL-1/DBX® will be sold in a convenience kit with a diluent and a syringe of 510(k) cleared demineralized bone (“DBX® Putty”) produced by MTF. A delivery device will allow the surgeon to mix the reconstituted NELL-1 with the appropriate quantity of DBX® Putty just prior to implantation.
 
The NELL-1/DBX® Fusion Device is intended for use in lumbar spinal fusion and may have a variety of other spine and orthopedic applications.
 
While the product is initially targeted at the lumbar spine fusion market, in keeping with our exclusive license agreement, we believe NELL-1’s unique set of characteristics, target specific mechanism of action, efficacy, safety and affordability position the product well for application in a variety of procedures including:
 
Spine Implants. This is the largest market for bone substitute product, representing greater than 70% of the total U.S. market according to Transparency Market Research. While use of the patient’s own bone, also referred to as autograft, to enhance fusion of vertebral segments remains the optimal use for this type of treatment, complications associated with use of autograft bone including pain, increased surgical time and infection limit its use.
   
Non-Union Trauma Cases. While the majority of fractures heal without the need for osteosynthetic products, bone substitutes are used in complicated breaks where the bone does not mend naturally. NELL-1 is expected to perform as well as high-priced growth factors in this market.
   
Hip & Knee Revisions. The use of bone substitutes in reconstruction surgery is generally limited to revision cases where the products are used to account for the significant bone loss that accompanies these cases. The treatment of osteoporotic patients also represents a substantial opportunity for NELL-1’s use in hip and knee reconstruction.
   
Implant Coating. The use of NELL-1 as a direct coating on hip and knee implants could have a very significant impact on the market. A NELL-1 coating may prolong the life of primary implants and allow for differentiation in a commodity market.
   
Osteoporosis. The medical need to find a solution to counter a decrease in bone mass and density seen in women most frequently after menopause or a similar effect on astronauts in microgravity environments for an extended period is a major medical challenge. The systemic use of NELL-1 to stimulate bone regeneration throughout the body thereby increasing bone density could have a very significant impact on the treatment of osteoporosis.
 
UCLA’s initial research was funded with approximately $18 million in resources from UCLA and government grants. Since licensing the exclusive worldwide intellectual property rights from UCLA, our continued development has been funded through various strategic investments. Our research and development expenses, which include the fair value of stock options issued to our consultants, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $11,602,776 and $3,666,108, respectively. We anticipate that it will require an additional $22 million to complete protein synthesis, animal studies, and commence first in man studies. An estimated additional $137 million will be required to achieve product launch.
 
NELL-1’s powerful specific bone and cartilage forming properties are derived from the ability of NELL-1 to only target cells that exhibit an activated “master switch” to develop into bone or cartilage. NELL-1 is a function specific recombinant human protein that has been proven in laboratory bench models to recapitulate normal human growth and development to provide control over bone and cartilage regeneration.
 
NELL-1 was isolated in 1996, and the first NELL-1 patent on bone regeneration was filed in 1999. Subsequent patents and continuations in part describing NELL-1 manufacturing, delivery, and cartilage regeneration were filed to further strengthen the patent portfolio.

RESEARCH & PUBLICATIONS
 
Our leading scientists have been published in notable scientific journals and publications in our field. There are more than 80 publications that serve to highlight the work and achievements of the researchers and the Company.
PROPOSED INITIAL CLINICAL APPLICATION
 
The NELL-1/DBX® Fusion Device will be indicated for spinal fusion procedures in skeletally mature patients with degenerative disc disease (“DDD”) at one level from L4-S1. These DDD patients may also have up to Grade I spondylolisthesis at the involved level. The NELL-1/DBX® Fusion Device is to be implanted via an anterior open or an anterior laparoscopic approach in conjunction with a cleared intervertebral body fusion device. Patients receiving the device should have had at least six months of non-operative treatment prior to treatment with the device. A cervical indication is currently under consideration. This indication for use would fill a current clinical gap, created by potentially dangerous inflammatory responses caused by commercially available catalytic bone growth agents, the subject of a Public Health Notification from the FDA on July 1, 2008 about life threatening complications associated with a recombinant human protein in cervical spine fusion. We do not expect our product to see the same adverse events with NELL-1/DBX® as have been observed with other commercially available protein. We have performed a rat femoral onlay model to compare proinflammatory response of rhBMP-2 and NELL-1 within Helistate collagen sponges. While NELL-1 induced normal healing, rhBMP-2 induced significant amounts of swelling and histological evidence of intense inflammatory response.
DESCRIPTION OF THE DBX® PUTTY TO BE USED WITH NELL-1
 
The DBX® Demineralized Bone Putty provided in the convenience kit with NELL-1/DBX® is a Class III device with a pre-market approval (PMA). The common name is “Bone Void Filler Containing Human Demineralized Bone Matrix.” The product is regulated under 21 C.F.R. §888.3045 Resorbable calcium salt bone void filler device, Product Codes MQV, GXP, and MBP. MTF is the manufacturer of the DBX® Putty. This product was cleared by the FDA under 510(k) number K053218 for spine indication in December 2006.
 
DBX® Putty is a matrix composed of processed human cortical bone. Demineralized bone granules are mixed with sodium hyaluronate to form the DBX® Putty. Every lot of final DBX® Putty product is tested in an athymic mouse model or in an alkaline phosphatase assay, which has been shown to have a positive correlation with the athymic mouse model, to ensure osteostimulation.
 
Based upon extensive discussions with regulatory experts and a specific communication from the FDA in response to a submission of our plan under the Exclusive License between UCLA and the Company we believe the NELL-1/DBX® Fusion Device will be regulated as a Class III medical device and will therefore require submission and approval of a pre-market approval, (“PMA”). The FDA response to the submission of our plan is: “We have determined that the product is a combination product that will be regulated under Device authorities, with CDRH (Center for Devices and Radiological Health) as the lead center.”
 
OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY
 
Our business strategy is to develop our target specific platform technology to meet a current established market with improvement in patient outcomes and reduction in costs to the healthcare delivery system. Our focus continues to narrow from the research to the development stage to allow for the approval for use of our target specific protein exhibiting efficacy and safety by matching or exceeding current market approved products. Identifying the best future strategic partners to facilitate the development through pre Investigational Device Exemption (“IDE”), clinical, and ultimate commercialization is critical as we fund the pre-IDE work and continue achieving milestones. We believe that the licensing of the distribution of the NELL-1 product in the fields of use focused upon will generate sufficient funding to provide for the ongoing development of the Platform Technology across other surgical and therapeutic fields.

DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMPANY
 
The Company was incorporated in Delaware on October 18, 2007 as AFH Acquisition X, Inc. Pursuant to a Merger Agreement, dated September 19, 2014, by and among the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiary, Bone Biologics Acquisition Corp. and Bone Biologics, Inc. Merger Sub merged with and into Bone Biologics Inc., with Bone Biologics remaining as the surviving corporation in the merger. Upon the consummation of the merger, the separate existence of Merger Sub ceased. On September 22, 2014, the Company officially changed its name to “Bone Biologics Corporation” to more accurately reflect the nature of its business and Bone Biologics, Inc. became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Bone Biologics, Inc. was incorporated in California on June 9, 2004. In connection with the merger, the 5,000,000 outstanding shares of common stock of the Company prior to the merger were consolidated into 3,853,600 shares of Common Stock and the remaining shares were cancelled. Additionally, all of the issued and outstanding shares of Bone Biologics Inc.’s common stock converted into a combined total of 19,897,587 shares of the Company’s Common Stock (including 2,151,926 shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding warrants and 5,648,658 shares issuable upon the conversion of debt).
The UCLA License Agreement
 
On March 15, 2006, the Company entered into an exclusive license agreement (the “Initial Agreement”) with the Regents of the University of California Los Angeles (“UCLA”). The Initial Agreement has been amended through ten sets of amendments (as so amended, the “The UCLA License Agreement”).
 
The UCLA License Agreement provides us with an exclusive license to several of UCLA patents covering, among other things, enhanced NELL-1 bone mineralization. The grant of the UCLA License Agreement is subject to any license obligations to the U.S. government, and the term of the license lasts until the last-to-expire UCLA patent licensed under the UCLA License Agreement expires. Under the UCLA License Agreement, we are permitted to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale and import any products covered by the UCLA License Agreement patents in a certain Field of Use which is currently defined as special function by local administration and expressly excludes osteoporosis and cartilage indications or systemic administration in all indications. Pursuant to a Tenth Amendment, we have been granted the exclusive right to negotiate an expansion of the Field of Use to include treatment of osteoporosis (the “Option”). The term of the Option is for one year commencing June 1, 2016. We may exercise the option by providing notice after completion of certain milestones. Upon exercise of the Option, we and UCLA will negotiate in good faith the terms of an agreement. After December 22, 2016, we may notify UCLA of our interest in requesting an expansion of the Field of Use to include additional available indications, including cartilage indications or systemic administration in the Field of Use. The parties will engage in good faith discussions of such requests.
 
We have agreed to pay an annual maintenance fee to UCLA of $10,000 as well as to pay certain royalties to UCLA under the UCLA License Agreement at the rate of 3.0% of net sales of licensed products. We must pay the royalties to UCLA on a quarterly basis. Upon a first commercial sale, we also must pay between $50,000 and $250,000, depending on the calendar year that is after the first commercial sale. If we are required to pay any third party any royalties as a result of us making use of UCLA patents, then we may reduce the royalty owed to UCLA by 0.333% for every percentage point paid to a third party. If we grant sublicense rights to a third party to use the UCLA patent, then we will pay to UCLA 10% to 20% of the sublicensing income we receive from such sublicense.
 
We are obligated to make the following milestone payments to UCLA for each Licensed Product or Licensed Method:

Upon any voluntary partial prepayment of outstanding principal, Hankey Capital will return Collateral Shares to the Company in the amount necessary, if any, to maintain the loan to value ratio at no less than 50%. Upon a full payment of the outstanding principal, all Collateral Shares will be returned and cancelled. Hankey Capital will also return Collateral Shares under the same terms in case of partial or full conversion of the Convertible Note. In connection with the Convertible Note, on February 24, 2016 the Company issued 2,531,646 common shares as collateral, paid a commitment fee in the amount of $40,000 (2% of the original principal amount of the Loan) and a warrant to Hankey Capital for 1,463,415 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price per share of $2.05. The Warrant will expire on February 23, 2021. The Note and Warrant contain provisions limiting the exercise/conversion thereof.

In connection with the financing with Hankey Capital, Hankey Capital exercised warrants to purchase an aggregate of 791,139 shares resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of $1,250,000, and the parties agreed to extend the maturity date of the first two convertible secured notes to December 31, 2019 and fix the conversion rate to $1.58. The Company also agreed to extend the term of all outstanding warrants to five years from issuance.
 
Convertible Promissory Notes
 
On October 14, 2016, pursuant to a Note Purchase Agreement, the Company issued to each of MTF and Hankey Capital a convertible promissory note in the amount of $600,000 (each a “Convertible Note”). The Convertible Note matures on December 31, 2017 (the “Maturity Date”) and bears interest at an annual rate of interest of 8.5% per annum until maturity. Prior to the Maturity Date, each of MTF and Hankey Capital has a right, in its sole discretion, to convert their Convertible Note into shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Conversion Shares”), at a conversion rate equal to $1.00 per share. In the event of a financing resulting in gross proceeds of at least $5,000,000, the holders of the Convertible Notes will be required to convert their Convertible Notes into the same securities issued in such financing at the same price per share. In addition, if the Convertible Notes are not paid by the Maturity Date, they will be automatically converted in shares of Common Stock at a conversion price of $1.00 per share. Hankey Capital’s Convertible Note is secured by all of the Company’s assets. The Company has granted piggyback registration rights with respect to the Conversion Shares.
 
Pursuant to the October 2016 Note Purchase Agreement, the Company may only use the proceeds from the issuance of those convertible notes to focus on prioritizing operations on essential research and development activities. Also pursuant to the October 2016 Note Purchase Agreement, the Company’s management has agreed to defer 20% of earned compensation and the Board of Directors has authorized a change in director compensation to defer 50% of the directors’ cash compensation until at least $5,000,000 has been received in cumulative funding from non-current stockholders.
 
On January 23, 2017 the Company, MTF and Hankey Capital, executed an amendment (the “Amendment”) to the Convertible Notes. The Amendment extends the maturity date of each of the Convertible Notes to December 31, 2017 from December 31, 2016. By extending the maturity date, the date that the Convertible Notes automatically convert into shares of the Company’s Common Stock is also extended to December 31, 2017. The Amendment is effective retroactive to December 31, 2016.
 
On February 10, 2017 pursuant to a Note Purchase Agreement, the Company issued to Hankey Capital a convertible promissory note in the amount of $1,000,000 (“Convertible Note”). The Convertible Note matures on December 31, 2017 (the “Maturity Date”) and bears interest at an annual rate of interest of 8.5% until maturity. Prior to the Maturity Date, Hankey Capital has a right, in its sole discretion, to convert its Convertible Note into shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Conversion Shares”), at a conversion rate equal to $1.00 per share. In the event of a financing resulting in gross proceeds of at least $5,000,000, the holder of the Convertible Note will be required to convert their Convertible Note into the same securities issued in such financing at the same price per share. Also, if the Convertible Note is not paid by the Maturity Date, it will be automatically converted in shares of Common Stock at a conversion price of $1.00 per share. Hankey Capital’s Convertible Note is secured by all of the Company’s assets. The Company has granted piggyback registration rights with respect to the Conversion Shares.

COMPETITION
 
The orthobiologic and orthopedic industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on intellectual property. We face substantial competition from many different sources, including large and specialty orthopedic companies, biotechnology companies, academic research institutions and governmental agencies along with public and private research institutions.
 
Our business is in a very competitive and evolving field, that faces competition from large established orthopedic companies such as (but not limited to) Medtronic, Stryker, Zimmer-Biomet, and DePuy-Synthes that possess considerably more resources than Bone Biologics.
 
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.
 
The NELL-1 growth factor is mechanistically distinct from BMPs and can minimize complications associated with BMP therapies. The early proof of concept animal studies has shown the efficacy of NELL-1 combined with demineralized bone matrix (DBM) as a novel bone graft material for interbody spine fusion.
 
CUSTOMERS
 
The populations of interest include spine surgeons, and patients with a skeletal bone defect or bone-related condition in their spine, for which intervention is undertaken to correct such a defect. Spine surgeons and patients can choose to eliminate the need to perform a second painful surgery to obtain autograft harvest of hip bone for fusion procedures by utilizing various other types of biologics.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION
 
The manufacturing and marketing of any product which we may formulate with our technologies as well as our related research and development activities are subject to regulation for safety, efficacy and quality by governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries. We anticipate that these regulations will apply separately to each product. The Company believes that complying with these regulations will involve a considerable level of time, expense and uncertainty.

In the U.S., drugs are subject to rigorous federal regulation and, to a lesser extent, state regulation. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of our products. Drug development and approval within this regulatory framework is difficult to predict, requires a number of years and involves the expenditure of substantial resources. Moreover, ongoing legislation by U.S. Congress and rule making by the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) presents an ever-changing landscape where we could be required to undertake additional activities before any governmental approval is granted allowing us to market our products. The steps required before a pharmaceutical agent may be marketed in the U.S. include:
 

● | Laboratory and non-clinical tests for safety and small scale manufacturing of the agent; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The submission to the FDA of an IDE which must become effective before human clinical trials can commence; 
● | Clinical trials to characterize the efficacy and safety of the product in the intended patient population; 
● | The submission of a New Drug Application (“NDA”) or PMA to the FDA; and 
● | FDA approval of the NDA or PMA prior to any commercial sale or shipment of the product. 

 
In addition to obtaining FDA approval for each product, each manufacturing establishment must be registered with, and approved by, the FDA. Moreover, manufacturing establishments are subject to biennial inspections by the FDA and must comply with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices “cGMP” for products, drugs and devices.
 
Non-clinical Trials
 
Non-clinical testing includes laboratory evaluation of chemistry and formulation as well as tissue culture and animal studies to assess the safety and potential efficacy of the product. Non-clinical safety tests must be conducted by laboratories that comply with FDA regulations regarding good laboratory practices. Non-clinical testing is inherently risky and the results can be unpredictable or difficult to interpret. The results of non-clinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IDE and are reviewed by the FDA prior to the commencement of clinical trials. Unless the FDA objects to an IDE, clinical studies may begin 30 days after the IDE is submitted. We have relied and intend to continue to rely on third-party contractors to perform non-clinical trials.
Clinical Trials
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or to patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with good clinical practices under protocols that detail the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used to monitor safety and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA prior to its conduct. Further, each clinical study must be conducted under the auspices of an independent institutional review board. The institutional review board will consider, among other things, ethical factors, the safety of human subjects and the possible liability of the institution. The drug product used in clinical trials must be manufactured according to the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices.
 
Clinical trials under IDE regulations are typically conducted in two sequential trials. In the Pilot trial, the initial introduction of the product into healthy human subjects, the drug is tested for safety (adverse side effects), absorption, metabolism, bio-distribution, excretion, food and drug interactions, abuse as well as limited measures of pharmacologic effect and proof of principle that involves studies in a limited patient population in order to:
 

● | assess the potential efficacy of the product for specific, targeted indications; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | demonstrate efficacy in a limited patient population; 
● | identify the range of doses likely to be effective for the indication; and 
● | identify possible adverse events and safety risks.

When there is evidence that the product may be effective and has an acceptable safety profile in Pilot evaluations, Pivotal trials are undertaken to establish and confirm the clinical efficacy and establish the safety profile of the product within a larger population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. Pivotal trials frequently involve randomized controlled trials and, whenever possible, studies are conducted in a manner so that neither the patient nor the investigator knows what treatment is being administered. The Company, or the FDA, may suspend clinical trials at any time if it is believed that the individuals participating in such trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks. We intend to rely upon third-party contractors to advise and assist us in the preparation of our IDEs and the conduct of clinical trials that will be conducted under the IDEs.
 
Premarket Approval and FDA Approval Process
 
The results of the manufacturing process, development work, non-clinical studies and clinical studies are submitted to the FDA in the form of a PMA prior to marketing and selling the product. The testing and approval process is likely to require substantial time and effort. In addition to the results of non-clinical and clinical testing, the PMA applicant must submit detailed information about chemistry, manufacturing and controls that will describe how the product is made and tested through the manufacturing process.
 
The PMA review process involves FDA investigation into the details of the manufacturing process, as well as the design and analysis of each of the non-clinical and clinical studies. This review includes inspection of the manufacturing facility, the data recording process for the clinical studies, the record keeping at a sample of clinical trial sites and a thorough review of the data collected and analyzed for each non-clinical and clinical study. Through this investigation, the FDA reaches a decision about the risk-benefit profile of a product candidate. If the benefit is worth the risk, the FDA begins negotiating with the company about the content of an acceptable package insert and associated Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (“REMS”), if required.
 
The approval process is affected by a number of factors, including the severity of the disease, the availability of alternative treatments and the risks and benefits demonstrated in clinical trials. Consequently, there is a risk that approval may not be granted on a timely basis, if at all. The FDA may deny a PMA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information or require post-marketing testing (Phase 4) and surveillance to monitor the safety of a company’s product if it does not believe the PMA contains adequate evidence of the safety and efficacy of the product. Moreover, if regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which it may be marketed. Finally, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or health problems are identified that would alter the risk-benefit analysis for the product. Post-approval studies may be conducted to explore the use of the product for new indications or populations such as pediatrics.
 
Among the conditions for PMA approval is the requirement that any prospective manufacturer’s quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to the FDA’s Good Manufacturing Practices and the specifications approved in the PMA. In complying with standards set forth in these regulations, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of product and quality control to ensure full technical compliance. Manufacturing establishments, both foreign and domestic, also are subject to inspections by or under the authority of the FDA and by other federal, state or local agencies. Additionally, in the event of non-compliance, FDA may issue warning letters and/or seek criminal and civil penalties, enjoin manufacture, seize product or revoke approval.
 
International Approval
 
Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product by regulatory authorities in foreign countries must be obtained prior to the commencement of commercial sales of the drug in such countries. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials and drug approvals vary widely from country to country, and the time required for approval may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. Although there are some procedures for unified filings for certain European countries, in general, each country at this time has its own procedures and requirements.

Other Regulation
 
In addition to regulations enforced by the FDA, we are also subject to U.S. regulation under the Controlled Substances Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other present and potential future federal, state, local or similar foreign regulations. Our research and development may involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals and radioactive compounds. Although we believe that its safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated. In the event of any accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability could exceed our resources.
EMPLOYEES
 
As of the date hereof, we have three (3) full-time employees.
