General Development of Business
As a result of a series of mergers that were completed on June 7, 2013, Liberty Global became the publicly-held parent company of the successors by merger of Liberty Global, Inc. (the predecessor to Liberty Global) and Virgin Media Inc. (Virgin Media). In the following text, the terms “we”, “our”, “our company” and “us” may refer, as the context requires, to Liberty Global (or its predecessor) or collectively to Liberty Global (or its predecessor) and its subsidiaries. Unless otherwise indicated, convenience translations into United States (U.S.) dollars are calculated as of December 31, 2020, and operational data, including subscriber statistics and ownership percentages, are as of December 31, 2020.
Acquisitions and Dispositions
We have also completed a number of strategic acquisitions and dispositions over the last several years. We made these acquisitions and dispositions in order to execute on our strategy to focus on markets where we have focused on creating national champion converged businesses in core markets and to unlock significant synergies. Our significant acquisitions include:
•On November 11, 2020, we completed the acquisition of Sunrise Communications Group AG (Sunrise) through the settlement of the all cash public tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Sunrise (the Sunrise Acquisition). As of December 31, 2020, Liberty Global holds 98.9% of the share capital of Sunrise and has initiated a statutory “squeeze-out” procedure according to applicable Swiss law pursuant to which we will acquire the remaining Sunrise Shares that we do not yet own. This “squeeze-out” procedure is expected to be completed during the first half of 2021.
•On June 3, 2019, Telenet Group Holding N.V. (Telenet) acquired the remaining 50.0% of De Vijver Media NV (De Vijver Media) that it did not already own (the De Vijver Media Acquisition). De Vijver Media provides content production, broadcasting and advertising services in Belgium. 
•On June 19, 2017, Telenet acquired Coditel Brabant sprl, operating under the brand name SFR BeLux (SFR BeLux), which provided broadband operations in Belgium (Brussels and Wallonia) and Luxembourg.
•On May 16, 2016, we acquired Cable & Wireless Communications Limited (C&W), a provider of telecommunication services, including mobile and high-speed broadband, focused in Latin America and the Caribbean. In connection with the Split-off Transaction referenced below under —Dispositions, we have since transferred C&W to Liberty Latin America Ltd. (Liberty Latin America). 
•On February 11, 2016, Telenet acquired BASE Company N.V. (BASE), the third-largest mobile network operator in Belgium. 
For additional information on our acquisitions see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, we have completed various other smaller acquisitions in the normal course of business.
We have completed the following dispositions during the past several years: 
•On July 31, 2019, we completed the sale of our operations in Germany, Romania, Hungary and the Czech Republic to Vodafone Group plc (Vodafone). The operations of Germany, Romania, Hungary and the Czech Republic are collectively referred to herein as the “Vodafone Disposal Group.” In connection with the sale of the Vodafone Disposal Group, we have agreed to provide certain transitional services to Vodafone for a period of up to four years. These services principally comprise network and information technology-related functions.
•On May 2, 2019, we completed the sale of our direct-to-home satellite (DTH) operations, which serves customers in Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Romania (UPC DTH) to M7 Group (M7). In connection with the sale of UPC DTH, we have agreed to provide certain transitional services to M7 for a period of up to two years. These services principally comprise network and information technology-related functions.
•On July 31, 2018, we completed the sale of our Austrian operations (UPC Austria) to Deutsche Telekom AG (Deutsche Telekom). In connection with the sale of UPC Austria, we have agreed to provide certain transitional services to Deutsche Telekom for a period of up to four years. These services principally comprise network and information technology-related functions. 
•On December 29, 2017, we effected the split-off of our LiLAC Group (the Split-off Transaction) by distributing 100% of the common shares of Liberty Latin America to holders of our then LiLAC ordinary shares. The “LiLAC Group” consisted of our businesses, assets and liabilities in Latin America and the Caribbean, including C&W, VTR.com SpA, a 60% interest in Liberty Cablevision of Puerto Rico LLC and related cash and cash equivalents and 
I-2


indebtedness. Following such distribution, the LiLAC Shares were redesignated as deferred shares (with virtually no economic rights) and subsequently canceled. In connection with the Split-off Transaction, Liberty Latin America became a separate publicly traded company. 
•On December 31, 2016, our company and Vodafone contributed our respective operations in the Netherlands to VodafoneZiggo Group Holding B.V., a 50:50 joint venture (referred to herein as the VodafoneZiggo JV). We treat the VodafoneZiggo JV as an equity investment. 
For additional information on our more recent dispositions, see note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have also completed various other smaller dispositions in the normal course of business and as required by regulatory authorities in connection with approving certain of our acquisitions. Further, we are evaluating a change in jurisdiction of incorporation to Bermuda, which has U.S.-style corporate laws and lower administrative costs. To the extent the Company determines to move forward with any re-domicile transaction, we would seek shareholder approval in advance.
Pending Transactions
On May 7, 2020, we entered into a Contribution Agreement (the Contribution Agreement) with, among others, Telefonica SA (Telefónica). Pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, Liberty Global and Telefónica agreed to form a 50:50 joint venture (the U.K. JV), which will combine Virgin Media’s operations in the U.K. along with certain other Liberty Global subsidiaries created as a result of the pending U.K. JV (together, the U.K. JV Entities) with Telefónica’s mobile business in the U.K. to create a nationwide integrated communications provider.
The consummation of the transaction contemplated by the Contribution Agreement is subject to certain conditions, including competition clearance by the applicable regulatory authorities. The Contribution Agreement also includes customary termination rights, including a right of the parties to terminate the agreement if the transaction has not closed within 24 months following the date of the Contribution Agreement, which may be extended by six months under certain circumstances. 
Network Expansion and Upgrades
We have expanded our broadband footprint through new build projects and strategically selected acquisitions. Our new build projects consist of network extension programs pursuant to which we connect additional homes and businesses to our broadband communications network (Network Extensions). Our investment in Network Extensions is critical not only for our business to grow, but also for the countries and communities in which we operate. The Network Extensions, together with upgrades to our existing networks and next generation customer premises equipment, provide our customers the means to enter the gigaworld society. During 2020, through our Network Extensions, we connected approximately 561,000 additional residential and commercial premises (excluding upgrades) to our networks, including approximately 426,000 residential and commercial premises connected by Virgin Media in the United Kingdom (U.K.), and Ireland. We expect to continue the Network Extensions in 2021. Depending on a variety of factors, however, including the financial and operations results of our new build programs, the Network Extensions may be continued, modified or cancelled at our discretion. 
Equity Transactions 
Share repurchases are an important part of our strategy in returning value to our shareholders. Pursuant to our share repurchase programs authorized by our board of directors, we have repurchased a significant amount of our shares since our inception in 2005. During 2020, our share repurchases were: 

Title of shares | | Number of shares | Average price paid per share(1) | | Aggregate purchase price(1)
 | | | | | in millions 
Class A ordinary shares | 1,309,000 | | $ | 22.38 | | $ | 29.4 
Class C ordinary shares | 54,473,323 | | $ | 19.15 | | $ | 1,043.2

_______________
(1)Amounts include direct acquisition costs.
At December 31, 2020, the remaining amount authorized for share repurchases was $1.0 billion. For a further description of our share repurchases, see note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Description of Business
We are one of the world’s leading converged video, broadband and communications companies, with a commitment to providing our customers the “best in class” communications and entertainment services. These services are delivered to our residential and business customers over our networks and include broadband internet, video, telephony and mobile services. Telenet, the VodafoneZiggo JV and Sunrise UPC deliver mobile services as mobile network operators, and Virgin Media, UPC Poland and UPC Slovakia deliver mobile services as MVNOs through third-party networks. Sunrise UPC also delivers mobile services as a MVNO pursuant to a legacy contract prior to the Sunrise acquisition. We design our services to enable our customers to access the digital world on their own terms and at their own pace. Offering “best in class” connectivity is at the core of our strategy. Today, our extensive broadband network enables us to deliver ultra high-speed internet service across our markets, be it through fiber, cable or mobile technology. We are striving to extend our reach and reinforce our speed leadership. In most of our footprint we offer converged fixed and mobile experiences in and out of the home, and it is our ambition to further enhance this proposition and make it available to all our customers. 
We provide residential and business telecommunication services in the U.K. and Ireland through Virgin Media, Belgium through Telenet, Switzerland through Sunrise UPC, Poland through UPC Poland and Slovakia through UPC Slovakia. In terms of video subscribers, we operate the largest cable network in each of these countries, except in Poland, where we operate the second largest cable network. We also have investments in the VodafoneZiggo JV, which operates the largest cable network in the Netherlands, and in various content businesses. 
A breakdown of our revenue by major category for our consolidated reportable segments appears in note 20 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
By connecting our customers through our telecommunication services, we recognize that we are a global corporate citizen and that we play a role in addressing the environmental impacts generated through our business. By seeking to address these issues, we strengthen our company and provide strong benefits to the communities in which we operate. We remain a leader in our sector on climate change with an unwavering commitment to reducing our impact on the environment. In 2019 we continued to improve our operations to meet our new 2030 and 2050 science-based targets in line with the Paris Climate Accord. In fact, we were 40 times more carbon efficient compared to 2012. We also avoided more than 11,000 metric tons of carbon emissions and 2,500 metric tons of e-waste through our various environmental initiatives. Our gigabit broadband deployments in cities throughout our operating territories and efforts to accelerate the transition to 5G will underpin a low carbon economy, while revolutionizing healthcare, flexible working regimes and countless other aspects of our lives. Diversity and inclusion have long been priorities for Liberty Global and our operating companies, and will become even more integral moving forward. Over the past several years, Liberty Global, Virgin Media, VodafoneZiggo, Telenet and UPC Poland have all pursued gender diversity as strategic goals, with an emphasis on building a gender-diverse pipeline. Similarly, inclusion is a key focus area and we are committed to providing an environment that empowers everyone to bring their full selves to work while creating more inviting workplaces regardless of age, race, gender, ethnicity and sexual orientation.

__________________
(1)Homes Passed are homes, residential multiple dwelling units or commercial units that can be connected to our networks without materially extending the distribution plant. Certain of our Homes Passed counts are based on census data that can change based on either revisions to the data or from new census results. Due to the fact that we do not own the partner networks (defined below) used in Switzerland (see note 9 below), we do not report homes passed for Switzerland’s partner networks.
(2)Fixed-Line Customer Relationships are the number of customers who receive at least one of our internet, video or telephony services that we count as Revenue Generating Units (RGUs), without regard to which or to how many services they subscribe. Fixed-Line Customer Relationships generally are counted on a unique premises basis. Accordingly, if an individual receives our services in two premises (e.g., a primary home and a vacation home), that individual generally will count as two Fixed-Line Customer Relationships. We exclude mobile-only customers from Fixed-Line Customer Relationships. 
(3)RGU is separately a Basic Video Subscriber, Enhanced Video Subscriber, Internet Subscriber or Telephony Subscriber (each as defined and described below). A home, residential multiple dwelling unit, or commercial unit may contain one or more RGUs. For example, if a residential customer in our U.K. market subscribed to our enhanced video service, fixed-line telephony service and broadband internet service, the customer would constitute three RGUs. Total RGUs is the sum of Basic Video, Enhanced Video, Internet and Telephony Subscribers. RGUs generally are counted on a unique premises basis such that a given premises does not count as more than one RGU for any given service. On the other hand, if an individual receives one of our services in two premises (e.g., a primary home and a vacation home), that individual will count as two RGUs for that service. Each bundled cable, internet or telephony service is counted as a separate RGU regardless of the nature of any bundling discount or promotion. Non-paying subscribers are counted as subscribers during their free promotional service period. Some of these subscribers may choose to disconnect after their free service period. Services offered without charge on a long-term basis (e.g., VIP subscribers or free service to employees) generally are not counted as RGUs. We do not include subscriptions to mobile services in our externally reported RGU counts. In this regard, our RGU counts exclude our separately reported postpaid and prepaid mobile subscribers. 
(4)Internet Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives internet services over our networks, or that we service through a partner network. In Switzerland, we offer a 10 Mbps internet service to our Basic and Enhanced Video Subscribers without an incremental recurring fee. Our Internet Subscribers in Switzerland include 51,500 subscribers who have requested and received this service.
(5)Basic Video Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives our video service over our broadband network or through a partner network either via an analog video signal or via a digital video signal without subscribing to any recurring monthly service that requires the use of encryption-enabling technology. Encryption-enabling technology includes smart cards, or other integrated or virtual technologies that we use to provide our enhanced service offerings. We count RGUs on a unique premises basis. In other words, a subscriber with multiple outlets in one premises is counted as one RGU and a subscriber with two homes and a subscription to our video service at each home is counted as two RGUs. We have approximately 30,600 “lifeline” customers that are counted on a per connection basis, representing the least expensive regulated tier of video cable service, with only a few channels. 
(6)Enhanced Video Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives our video service over our broadband network or through a partner network via a digital video signal while subscribing to any recurring monthly service that requires the use of encryption-enabling technology. Enhanced Video Subscribers are counted on a unique premises basis. For example, a subscriber with one or more set-top boxes that receives our video service in one premises is generally counted as just one subscriber. An Enhanced Video Subscriber is not counted as a Basic Video Subscriber. As we migrate customers from basic to enhanced video services, we report a decrease in our Basic Video Subscribers equal to the increase in our Enhanced Video Subscribers. Subscribers to enhanced video services provided by our operations in Switzerland over partner networks largely receive basic video services from the partner networks as opposed to our operations. 
(7)Telephony Subscriber is a home, residential multiple dwelling unit or commercial unit that receives voice services over our networks, or that we service through a partner network. Telephony Subscribers exclude mobile telephony subscribers. In Switzerland, we offer a basic phone service to our Basic and Enhanced Video Subscribers without an incremental recurring fee. Our Telephony Subscribers in Switzerland include 202,800 subscribers who have requested and received this service. 
(8)Our Mobile Subscriber count represents the number of active subscriber identification module (SIM) cards in service rather than services provided. For example, if a mobile subscriber has both a data and voice plan on a smartphone this would equate to one mobile subscriber. Alternatively, a subscriber who has a voice and data plan for a mobile handset and a data plan for a laptop would be counted as two mobile subscribers. Customers who do not pay a recurring monthly fee are excluded from our mobile subscriber counts after periods of inactivity ranging from 30 to 90 days, based on industry standards within the respective country. In a number of countries, our mobile subscribers receive mobile services pursuant to prepaid contracts. As of December 31, 2020, our mobile subscriber count included 475,900, 381,800 and 134,400 prepaid Mobile Subscribers in Switzerland, Belgium and the U.K., respectively.
(9)Pursuant to service agreements, Switzerland offers broadband internet, video and telephony services over networks owned by third-party cable operators (“partner networks”). A partner network RGU is only recognized if there is a direct billing relationship with the customer. At December 31, 2020, Switzerland’s partner networks accounted for 118,100 Fixed-Line Customer Relationships, 300,800 RGUs, which include 110,000 Internet Subscribers, 105,100 Video Subscribers and 85,700 Telephony Subscribers. 
I-8


Subscribers to our enhanced video services provided over partner networks largely receive basic video services from the partner networks as opposed to our operations. Due to the fact that we do not own these partner networks, we do not include the 657,300 homes passed by Switzerland’s partner networks at December 31, 2020. In addition, with the completion of the acquisition of Sunrise, we now service homes through Sunrise's existing agreements with Swisscom AG (Swisscom), Swiss Fibre Net and local utilities, which are not included in Switzerland's homes passed count. Including these arrangements, our operations in Switzerland have the ability to offer fixed services to a national footprint. 
(10)Amounts related to the VodafoneZiggo JV's fixed-line and mobile products include small business and multiple dwelling unit subscribers. In addition, the mobile amount shown for the VodafoneZiggo JV's includes medium and large enterprise subscribers. Prepaid mobile customers are excluded from the VodafoneZiggo JV's mobile telephony subscriber counts after a period of inactivity of nine months.
Additional General Notes to Table:
Most of our broadband communications subsidiaries provide broadband internet, video, telephony, mobile, data or other business services. Certain of our business service revenue is derived from small or home office (SOHO) subscribers that pay a premium price to receive enhanced service levels along with video, internet or telephony services that are the same or similar to the mass marketed products offered to our residential subscribers. All mass marketed products provided to SOHOs, whether or not accompanied by enhanced service levels and/or premium prices, are included in the respective RGU and customer counts of our broadband communications operations, with only those services provided at premium prices considered to be “SOHO RGUs” or “SOHO customers”. To the extent our existing customers upgrade from a residential product offering to a SOHO product offering, the number of SOHO RGUs or SOHO customers will increase, but there is no impact to our total RGU or customer counts. With the exception of our business SOHO subscribers, we generally do not count customers of business services as customers or RGUs for external reporting purposes.
In Belgium, Telenet leases a portion of its network under a long-term finance lease arrangement. These tables include operating statistics for Telenet’s owned and leased networks. 
While we take appropriate steps to ensure that subscriber statistics are presented on a consistent and accurate basis at any given balance sheet date, the variability from country to country in (1) the nature and pricing of products and services, (2) the distribution platform, (3) billing systems, (4) bad debt collection experience and (5) other factors add complexity to the subscriber counting process. We periodically review our subscriber counting policies and underlying systems to improve the accuracy and consistency of the data reported on a prospective basis. Accordingly, we may from time to time make appropriate adjustments to our subscriber statistics based on those reviews. 
Subscriber information for acquired entities is preliminary and subject to adjustment until we have completed our review of such information and determined that it is presented in accordance with our policies.

Products and Services
Our main products and services are WiFi and internet services, video, mobile, and telephony services.
Intelligent WiFi and Internet Services
Connectivity is a critical building block for vibrant communities. As highlighted by the current COVID-19 pandemic, all aspects of society, including families, businesses, education and healthcare, to name a few, rely heavily on connectivity and the digital services that depend on it. To meet our customers’ expectations of seamless connectivity, we are developing a fully digital, cloud based “Connectivity Ecosystem” built on top of our fiber-rich fixed broadband network and recently expanded mobile network. The Connectivity Ecosystem is orchestrated by a fully cloud-based digital journey, enabling fast and flexible introduction of new hardware and services, as well as cloud to cloud open API integration, simplifying the on-boarding of new services and devices. The devices used within our Connectivity Ecosystem are connected and protected through our security gateway and VPN, both at home and on the go. At home, our customers can benefit from the gigabit speeds enabled by our “Connect Box” (described below), as well as “Intelligent WiFi”, which has optimization functionalities, such as the ability to adapt to the number of people and devices online at any given time in order to improve and extend wireless connectivity reach and speeds. In addition, we introduced our first “Smart Home” bundles in select markets, enabling those customers to take their smart home ambitions to the next level, including enhanced entertainment, home automation and home security. Finally, our “Connect App” is the digital touchpoint that allows customers to access and manage all of our services. The full suite of the Connectivity Ecosystem is live in our U.K. and Switzerland markets, and we intend to expand availability in select markets during the first quarter of 2021.
Our "Connect Box" is our next generation intelligent WiFi and telephony gateway that enables us to maximize the impact of our ultrafast broadband networks by providing reliable wireless connectivity anywhere in the home. This gateway can be self-installed and allows customers to customize their home WiFi service. Our Connect Box is available in all our markets, and currently, approximately 10 million of our customers have a Connect Box. In addition to our core markets, we distribute our Connect Box to other markets in Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean. Robust wireless connectivity is increasingly important with our customers spending more and more time using bandwidth-heavy services on multiple devices. In Belgium, Switzerland and the U.K., we also offer our Connect App that, among other things, allows our customers to find their best WiFi access. In addition, we provide intelligent WiFi boosters, which increase speed, reliability and coverage by adapting to the environment at home. We also brought to market and are looking to expand the availability of our new Gigabit Connect Box based on DOCSIS 3.1 technology that provides even better in-home WiFi service to customers. 
Internet speed is of crucial importance to our customers, as they spend more time streaming video and other bandwidth-heavy services on multiple devices. Our extensive broadband network enables us to deliver ultra high-speed internet service across our markets. Our residential subscribers access the internet via cable modems connected to their internet capable devices, or wirelessly via a WiFi gateway device. We offer multiple tiers of broadband internet service up to Gigabit speeds and available to over 14 million homes across our footprint. In 2020, our networks continued to be recognized, with Virgin Media U.K. being awarded Fastest Broadband Provider in the U.K. and the VodafoneZiggo JV winning the Best Internet Provider award in the Netherlands for the tenth year in a row.
The speed of service depends on the location and the tier of service selected. By leveraging our existing fiber-rich broadband networks and our Network Extensions, we are in a position to deliver gigabit services by deploying the next generation DOCSIS 3.1 technology. DOCSIS 3.1 technology is an international standard that defines the requirements for data transmission over a cable system. Not only does DOCSIS 3.1 technology improve our internet speeds, it allows for network growth. Currently, our ultra high-speed internet service is based primarily on DOCSIS 3.1 technology, and we offer this technology in all of our markets.
We offer value-added broadband services in certain of our markets for an incremental charge. These services include Intelligent WiFi features, security (e.g., anti-virus, anti-spyware, firewall and spam protection), Smart Home services, and online storage solutions and web spaces. Subscribers to our internet service pay a monthly fee based on the tier of service selected. In addition to the monthly fee, customers pay an activation service fee upon subscribing to an internet service. This one-time fee may be waived for promotional reasons. We determine pricing for each different tier of internet service through an analysis of speed, market conditions and other factors. 
In all of our markets, we have deployed community WiFi via routers in the home (the Community WiFi), which provides secure access to the internet for our customers. Community WiFi is enabled by a cable modem WiFi access point (WiFi modem) in a Connect Box, a set-top box or a Horizon box of our internet customers. The Community WiFi is created through the sharing of access to the public channel of our customers’ home wireless routers. The public channel is a separate network 
I-10


from the secure private network used by the customer within the home and is automatically enabled when the WiFi modem is installed. Public WiFi access points (covering train stations, hotels, bars, restaurants and other public places) are also available for no additional cost.
Video Services
Our video service is, and continues to be, one of the foundations of our product offerings in our markets. Our cable operations offer multiple tiers of digital video programming and audio services, starting with a basic video service. Subscribers to our basic video service pay a fixed monthly fee and receive digital or analog video channels (including a limited number of high definition (HD) and ultra high definition 4K resolution (4K) channels) and several digital and analog radio channels, as well as an electronic programming guide. In the markets where we encrypt our basic digital service, our digital service is generally offered at an incremental cost equal to or slightly higher than the monthly fee for our basic analog service. We tailor our video services in each country of operation based on programming preferences, culture, demographics and local regulatory requirements. 
We also offer a variety of premium channel packages to meet the special interests of our subscribers. For an additional monthly charge, a subscriber may upgrade to one of our extended digital tier services and receive an increased number of video and radio channels, including the channels in the basic tier service and additional HD and 4K channels. Our channel offerings include general entertainment, sports, movies, documentaries, lifestyles, news, adult, children and ethnic and foreign channels.
Discounts to our monthly service fees are available to any subscriber who selects a bundle of two or more of our services (bundled services): video, internet, fixed-line telephony and, in most of our markets, mobile services. Bundled services consist of double-play for two services, triple-play for three services and, where available, quad-play for four services. 
To meet customer demands, we have enhanced our video services with additional relevant content services and features, which increase viewing comfort and address individual user needs. Our latest next generation product suite is called “Horizon 4”, a multi-screen entertainment platform that combines linear television (including recording and Replay TV features), premium video-on-demand (“VoD”) offerings, an increasing amount of integrated premium video apps and mobile viewing into one entertainment experience. Horizon 4 comes with a state of the art user interface that is intuitively easy to navigate. Content recommendations and favorite channel settings can be customized to individual user profiles. Video playback control, such as pause and resume, navigation shortcuts and content searches can all be conducted via a voice control button on the remote control, a feature highly appreciated by our customers. Horizon 4 is available in all of our markets on the latest set top boxes capable of delivering 4K video content and achieved significant positive customer feedback, manifesting in high product net promoter score (NPS) figures. Horizon 4 is marketed under the name “Telenet TV-Box” in Belgium, “UPC TV” in Switzerland, “Virgin TV360” in the U.K. and Ireland, “UPC TV 4K Box” in Poland and “MediaBox Next” in the Netherlands through the VodafoneZiggo JV. 
The predecessor version of Horizon 4, Horizon 3, is deployed on set-top boxes in the Netherlands (through the VodafoneZiggo JV), Switzerland and Ireland. While in Switzerland and Ireland these set-top boxes will continue to be exchanged for the latest hardware with Horizon 4 over time, in the Netherlands they will be flashed with the Horizon 4 software. 
In the U.K., the forerunner product of Horizon 4 is based on the TiVo platform and was developed under a strategic partnership agreement with TiVo Inc. The TiVo platform is deployed on a basic set-top box as well as the Virgin Media V6 box. Similar to Horizon 4, the Virgin Media V6 box combines 4K video, including high dynamic range, with improved streaming functionalities and more processing power. The Virgin Media V6 box allows customers to record six channels simultaneously while watching a seventh channel. Customers can also start watching programming on one television and pick up where they left off on other boxes in another room or through an app on their smart phones and tablets. Over 70% of our U.K. customers have the Virgin Media V6 box. Similar to the deployed hardware in the Netherlands via the VodafoneZiggo JV, over time these V6 boxes will be flashed with the latest Horizon 4 software, bringing our latest and most successful television and entertainment experience to our U.K. customers without the need of exchanging the installed hardware.
One of our key video services is “Replay TV”. Through Replay TV, the last seven days of content is made available via the electronic programming guide (EPG) for on demand viewing. Customers can simply open the EPG, scroll back and replay linear programming instantly. Replay TV also allows our customers to replay a television program from the start even while the live broadcast is in progress. Additionally, customers have the option of recording TV programs in the cloud (or onto the hard disk drive in the set top box in the U.K. and in Ireland). Replay TV is one of the most used and appreciated features on our platforms. 
I-11


In most of our markets, we offer transactional VoD giving subscribers access to thousands of movies and television series. In several of our markets, our subscription VoD service is included in our enhanced video offerings. This service is tailored to the specific market based on available content, consumer preferences and competitive offers, and includes various programming, such as music, kids, documentaries, adult, sports and TV series. We continue to develop our VoD services to provide a growing collection of programming from local and international suppliers, such as Disney/Fox, NBCU/Universal, CBS/Paramount, Warner and Sony, among others. In addition, in many of our markets we offer premium over the top (OTT) services like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video via certain of our set-top boxes. 
Most of this content is also available via our online mobile app, “Horizon Go”, which is available on mobile devices (iOS, Android and Windows) and, in some market places, via Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV and Android TV devices. Thanks to the 360 integration of Horizon 4 across multiple screens, customers can pause a program, series or movie and seamlessly continue watching from where they left off on another device, whether a television, tablet, smart phone or laptop. Additionally, Horizon Go enables customers to remotely schedule the recording of a television program on their Horizon 4 box at home. 
In the summer of 2020, we launched our first IP-only streaming device in Poland, which runs the full Horizon 4 product suite and features a small dongle-like form factor that can be tucked away behind a TV screen. This all-IP TV box has extremely low power consumption, and its casing is made from recycled plastic, proudly winning us Digital TV Europe’s Video Tech Innovation Sustainability Award in December 2020. We intend to roll out the all-IP TV box to additional markets in 2021 and beyond. 
Mobile Services
Mobile services are another key building block for us to provide customers with seamless connectivity. Virgin Media and UPC Poland offer mobile services as MVNOs over third-party networks, and Telenet, the VodafoneZiggo JV and UPC Sunrise offer mobile services as mobile network providers. 
Where mobile telephony services are provided via MVNOs, the relevant mobile operator leases a third-party’s radio access network and owns the core network, including switching, backbone and interconnections. These arrangements permit us to offer our customers in these markets mobile services without having to build and operate a cellular radio tower network. 
Our MVNO partners are:

Country | | Partner
U.K. | BT / EE(1) 
Switzerland | Swisscom(2) 
Ireland | Three (Hutchison)
Poland | Orange/Play 

____________
(1)Our U.K. operations agreed to a new MVNO agreement with Vodafone U.K. in November 2019, however, the MVNO arrangement with EE will continue until the end of 2021 by which time the full migration to the Vodafone U.K. network is expected to be complete.
(2)Our Switzerland operations completed migration to the Swisscom network in the beginning of 2019, and also have the right to access the Sunrise network as a mobile network operator.

Where mobile services are available, subscribers pay varying monthly fees depending on whether the mobile service is combined with our cable services or includes mobile data services via mobile phones, tablets or laptops. We offer our customers the option to purchase mobile handsets and, in most of our markets, make such purchase pursuant to a contract independent of their mobile services contract. We refer to these arrangements as split contracts. In Belgium, for those subscribers on Telenet’s own network, it is offering more flexible bundles adjusted to customers’ needs so they can use the full capacity of their package, regardless of their appetite to use either more data, minutes or text messages. As a mobile network provider, Telenet also has agreements with other mobile providers to use its mobile network for their mobile offerings. 
Our mobile services typically include voice, short message service (or SMS) and internet access. Calls, both within and out of network, incur a charge or are covered under a postpaid monthly service plan. Our mobile services are primarily on a postpaid basis with customers subscribing to services for periods ranging from activation for a SIM-only contract to up to 24 months (or 36 months in the U.K.), with the latter often taken with a subsidized mobile handset. In Belgium and Switzerland, however, our postpaid service is offered without a minimum contract term. In the U.K. and Belgium, we also offer a prepaid service, where the customers pay in advance for a pre-determined amount of airtime or data and generally have no minimum contract term. In almost all of our markets, subscribers to a double- or triple-play bundle receive a discount on their mobile service fee. 
I-12


Telephony Services
Multi-feature telephony services are available through voice-over-internet-protocol (VoIP) technology in most of our broadband communication markets. In the U.K., we also provide traditional circuit-switched telephony services. We pay interconnect fees to other telephony and internet providers when calls by our subscribers terminate on another network and receive similar fees from providers when calls by their users terminate on our network through interconnection points. 
Our telephony service may be selected in several of our markets on a standalone basis and in all of our markets in combination with one or more of our other services. Our telephony service includes a basic fixed-line telephony product for line rental and various calling plans, which may consist of any of the following: unlimited network, national or international calling, unlimited off-peak calling and minute packages, including calls to fixed and mobile phones. We also offer value added services, such as a personal call manager, unified messaging and a second or third phone line at an incremental cost. 
Multiple Dwelling Units and Partner Networks
Pursuant to an agreement executed on June 28, 2008 (the PICs Agreement) with four associations of municipalities in Belgium (the pure intercommunales or PICs), Telenet leases the PICs broadband communications network and, accordingly, makes its services available to all of the homes passed by the cable network owned by the PICs. Telenet has a direct customer relationship with the basic and enhanced video subscribers on the PICs network. Pursuant to the PICs Agreement, Telenet has full rights to use substantially all of the PICs network under a long-term finance lease. Unless extended, the PICs Agreement will expire on September 23, 2046, and cannot be terminated earlier (except in the case of non-payment or bankruptcy of Telenet). For additional information on the PICs Agreement, see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
For over 70% of the basic video subscribers of Sunrise UPC, Sunrise UPC maintains billing relationships with landlords or housing associations and provides basic video service to the tenants. The landlord or housing association administers the billing for the basic video service with their tenants and manages service terminations for their rental units. When tenants select triple-play bundles with or without mobile service from Sunrise UPC, they then migrate to a direct billing relationship with us.
Sunrise UPC offers broadband internet, enhanced video and telephony services directly to the video cable subscribers of those partner networks that enter into service operating contracts with Sunrise UPC. Sunrise UPC has the direct customer billing relationship with these subscribers. By permitting Sunrise UPC to offer some or all of its broadband internet, enhanced video and telephony products directly to those partner network subscribers, Sunrise UPC’s service operating contracts have expanded the addressable markets for Sunrise UPC’s digital products. In exchange for the right to provide digital products directly to the partner network subscribers, Sunrise UPC pays to the partner network a share of the revenue generated from those subscribers. Sunrise UPC also provides network maintenance services and engineering and construction services to its partner networks.
Business Services
In addition to our residential services, we offer business services in all of our operations. For business and public sector organizations, we provide a complete range of voice, advanced data, video, wireless and cloud-based services, as well as mobile and converged fixed-mobile services. Our business customers include SOHO (generally up to five employees), small business and medium and large enterprises. We also provide business services on a wholesale basis to other operators. 
Our business services are designed to meet the specific demands of our business customers with a wide range of services, including increased data transmission speeds and virtual private networks. These services fall into five broad categories: 
•data services for fixed internet access, with a 4G connectivity backup, IP virtual private networks based on SDWAN solutions, and high capacity point-to-point services, including dedicated cloud connections;
•cloud collaboration VoIP solutions and circuit switch telephony, unified communications and conferencing options; 
•wireless services for mobile voice and data, as well as managed WiFi networks;
•video programming packages and select channel lineups for targeted industries; and 
•value added services, including managed security systems, cloud enabled business applications, storage and web hosting.
Our intermediate to long-term strategy is to enhance our capabilities and offerings in the business sector so we become a preferred provider in the business market. To execute this strategy, customer experience and strategic marketing play a key role.
Our business services are provided to customers at contractually established prices based on the size of the business, type of services received and the volume and duration of the service agreement. SOHO and small business customers pay business 
I-13


market prices on a monthly subscription basis to receive enhanced service levels and business features that support their needs. For more advanced business services, these customers generally enter into a service agreement. For medium to large business customers, we enter into individual agreements that address their needs. These agreements are generally for a period of at least one year. 
Investments—VodafoneZiggo JV 
We own a 50% interest in the VodafoneZiggo JV, which is a leading Dutch company that provides fixed, mobile and integrated communication and entertainment services to consumers and businesses in the Netherlands. In connection with the formation of the VodafoneZiggo JV, we entered into a shareholders agreement with Vodafone providing for the governance of the VodafoneZiggo JV, including decision-making process, information access, dividend policy and non-compete provisions. It also provides for restrictions on transfer of interests in the VodafoneZiggo JV and exit arrangements. Under the dividend policy, the VodafoneZiggo JV is required to distribute all unrestricted cash to Vodafone and us, subject to minimum cash requirements and financing arrangements. We also entered into a framework agreement with the VodafoneZiggo JV to provide access to each partner’s expertise in the telecommunications business. For additional information on the above agreements, see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The fiber-rich broadband network of the VodafoneZiggo JV passes 7.3 million homes. The VodafoneZiggo JV also offers nationwide 4G and 5G mobile coverage. At December 31, 2020, the VodafoneZiggo JV had 9.5 million RGUs, of which 3.8 million were video, 3.4 million were broadband internet and 2.3 million were fixed-line telephony. In addition, the VodafoneZiggo JV had 5.2 million mobile customers. Besides its residential services, the VodafoneZiggo JV offers extensive business services throughout the Netherlands. The operations of the VodafoneZiggo JV are subject to various regulations, which are described below under Regulatory Matters—The Netherlands. 
The VodafoneZiggo JV’s customers continue to have access to Horizon TV and its functionalities (marketed as “Ziggo TV”), including Replay TV, the Ziggo Go app, pause live TV and VoD, 500 Mbps nationwide broadband internet to residential customers, 600 Mbps broadband internet to business customers and an extensive WiFi community network. The VodafoneZiggo JV also has its own sports channel, Ziggo Sport, and offers exclusive programming, such as HBO. Additionally, as of December 2020, the VodafoneZiggo JV has made 1 Gbps broadband internet available in 3 million households. The VodafoneZiggo JV’s customers also have access to Vodafone’s nationwide 4G (referred to herein as LTE) and 5G wireless services, under either a prepaid or postpaid service plan. The VodafoneZiggo JV provides its mobile services under various licenses, and recently acquired new spectrum licenses in the 700 MHz and 1400 MHz band, and renewed its license in the 2100 MHz band during the multiband auction in July 2020. With its mobile services, the VodafoneZiggo JV is able to offer quad-play bundles and converged services to its residential and business customers.
For all its services, the VodafoneZiggo JV competes primarily with the provision of similar services from the incumbent telecommunications operator Koninklijke KPN N.V. (KPN). KPN offers (1) internet protocol television (IPTV) over fiber optic lines where the fiber is to the home, cabinet, or building or to the node networks (fiber-to-the-home/-cabinet/-building/-node is referred to herein as FTTx) and through broadband internet connections using digital subscriber lines (DSL) or very high-speed DSL technology (VDSL) or an enhancement to VDSL called “vectoring”, (2) digital terrestrial television (DTT), and (3) LTE services. Where KPN has enhanced its VDSL system, it offers broadband internet with download speeds of up to 200 Mbps and on its FTTx networks, it offers download speeds of up to 1 Gbps. Its ability to offer a bundled triple-play of broadband internet, video and telephony services and fixed-mobile convergence services creates competitive pressure on the VodafoneZiggo JV’s operations, including the pricing and bundling of its video products. KPN’s video services include many of the interactive features that the VodafoneZiggo JV offers its subscribers, including pausing live TV, replay and third party apps. Portions of the VodafoneZiggo JV’s network have been overbuilt by KPN’s and other providers’ FTTx networks and expansion of these networks is expected to continue. Another significant competitor is the Netherlands operations of Deutsche Telekom.

Additional Business Information
Technology 
Our broadband internet, video and fixed-line telephony services are primarily transmitted over a hybrid fiber coaxial (HFC) cable network. This network is composed primarily of national and regional fiber networks, which are connected to the home over the last few hundred meters by coaxial cable. Alongside our HFC network, we are increasingly rolling out services based on fiber to the home (FTTH) and leveraging fixed wireless access (FWA) technologies to service customers not covered by our fixed networks in areas where it may not be cost effective to deploy fixed networks.
We closely monitor our network capacity and customer usage. Where necessary, we increase our capacity incrementally, for instance by splitting nodes in our cable network. We also continue to explore improvements to our services and new technologies that will enhance our customer’s connected entertainment experience. These actions include:
•recapturing bandwidth and optimizing our networks by: 
◦increasing the number of nodes in our markets; 
◦increasing the bandwidth of our hybrid fiber coaxial cable network to 1 GHz;
◦converting analog channels to digital;
◦moving channels to IP delivery;
◦deploying additional DOCSIS 3.1 channels; 
◦replacing copper lines with modern optic fibers; and 
◦using digital compression technologies.
•freeing spectrum for high-speed internet, VoD and other services by encouraging customers to move from analog to digital services;
•increasing the efficiency of our networks by moving headend functions (encoding, transcoding and multiplexing) to cloud storage systems;
•enhancing our network to accommodate business services;
•using wireless technologies to extend our services outside of the home;
•offering remote access to our video services through laptops, smart phones and tablets; 
•expanding the availability of Horizon TV and Virgin TV Go, as well as Horizon 4, and related products and developing and introducing online media sharing and streaming or cloud-based video; and
•testing new technologies. 
As stated under General Development of Business—Expansion and Acquisitions above, we are expanding our HFC and FTTH footprint through our Network Extensions. In addition, we are seeking mobile service opportunities where we have established cable networks and expanding our fixed-line networks where we have a strong mobile offering. This will allow us to offer converged fixed-line and mobile services to our customers. 
We deliver high-speed data and fixed-line telephony over our broadband network in our markets. The cable networks of our operations in Europe are connected to our “Aorta” backbone. The Aorta backbone is recognized as a Tier 1 Carrier, which permits us to serve our customers through settlement free collaboration with other carriers without the cost of using a third-party network. 
    In support of our connectivity strategy, we are moving our customers into a gigabit society. All of our broadband networks are already capable of supporting the next generation of ultra high-speed internet service at gigabit speeds. To provide these speeds to our subscribers, we launched our next generation gateways that will enable DOCSIS 3.1 technology throughout our footprint. The use of DOCSIS 3.1 technology provides us significantly higher efficiencies on our networks and allow us to offer faster speeds, in-home WiFi and better services. The new gateways and the continued upgrades to our network in the coming years will allow us to maximize high-speed connectivity over our broadband networks and deliver gigabit services in a cost-effective manner. It will also allow us to meet the expectations of our customers for high-speed internet access both in cities and rural areas of our footprint. While DOCSIS 3.1 technology will provide up to 2.5 Gbps, we are looking beyond our currently deployed technologies to DOCSIS 4.0 and FTTH / XGS-PON, which will enable 10 Gbps and beyond.

Supply Sources
Content. In our markets, entertainment platforms remain a key part of the telecommunication services bundle. Therefore, in addition to providing services that allow our customers to view programming when and where they want, we are investing in content that customers want. Our content strategy is based on: 
•proposition (exceeding our customers' entertainment desires and expectations); 
•product (delivering the best content available); 
•procurement (investment in the best brands, shows and sports); and 
•partnering (strategic alignment, acquisitions and growth opportunities).
We license almost all of our programming and on-demand offerings from content providers and third-party rights holders, including broadcasters and cable programming networks. Under our distribution agreements, we generally pay a monthly fee on a per channel or per subscriber basis, with occasional minimum pay guarantees. For on-demand programming, we generally pay a revenue share for transactional VoD (often with minimum guarantees) and a flat fee or a monthly fee per subscriber for subscription VoD. For a majority of our agreements, we seek to include the rights to offer the licensed programming to our customers through multiple delivery platforms and through our apps for smart phones and tablets. 
In seeking licenses for content, our primary focus is on partnering with leading international providers, such as Disney/Fox, Warner Media (including HBO), NBCUniversal, the BBC and Discovery. We also seek to carry in each of our markets key public and private broadcasters and in some markets we acquire local premium programing through select relationships with companies such as Sky plc (Sky) (U.K. and Ireland) and BT Group plc (BT). For our VoD services, we license a variety of programming, including box sets of television series, movies, music, kids’ programming and documentaries. In addition, we currently have arrangements with Netflix International B.V. (Netflix) and with Amazon Europe Core S.A.R.L. (Amazon). Pursuant to these arrangements, the Netflix service and Amazon Prime Video services respectively are available via certain of our set-top boxes to our video customers across many of our markets each as premium OTT services. The Netflix app is available to our customers in the U.K., the Netherlands through the VodafoneZiggo JV, Ireland, Switzerland and Belgium. The Amazon Prime Video app is currently available to our customers in the U.K. and Ireland.
Exclusive content is another element of our content strategy. To support this approach, we are investing in content assets. We have invested in various content companies, including ITV plc, All3Media Ltd., LionsGate Entertainment, STX, Virgin Media TV (formerly TV3 Group in Ireland) and De Vijver Media. We are also investing in sports, both as a broadcaster and as a rights owner. We have our own sports channels, Play Sports in Belgium, MySports in Switzerland, which Sunrise UPC licenses to other platforms in Switzerland, and VMSports in Ireland. Also, the VodafoneZiggo JV owns Ziggo Sport. The basic Ziggo Sport service is available exclusively to the VodafoneZiggo JV’s customers; however, the premium service is widely available through license arrangements. 
In addition, we have commissioned our own drama series content. Through All3Media Ltd., which we own jointly with Discovery, Inc., we co-produced a television series, known as The Feed, which was released in 2019 in several of our markets, and co-produced Blood in Ireland, which aired in 2018 and 2020. With LionsGate Entertainment, we pre-purchased the spy thriller series The Rook, which premiered in 2019. In addition, we have produced the Swiss sitcom Fassler-Kunz, the Swiss series Im Heimatland and the original Belgium series Chaussée d’Amour and De Dag with local production companies. These television series will primarily be available to our customers on an on-demand basis. We will also continue to commission, produce and/or co-produce content for our free-to-air (FTA) assets and VoD platforms in Ireland, and Telenet will continue to commission, produce and/or co-produce content for its FTA assets via SBS Belgium and VoD platforms in Belgium mainly via Streamz, its newly created joint venture for subscription VoD with DPG Media.
Customer Premises Equipment. We purchase each type of customer premises equipment from a number of different suppliers, with at least two or more suppliers providing our high-volume products. Customer premises equipment includes set-top boxes, modems, WiFi routers and boosters, digital video recorders (DVRs), tuners and similar devices. For each type of equipment, we retain specialists to provide customer support. For our broadband services, we use a variety of suppliers for our network equipment and the various services we offer. Similarly, we use a variety of suppliers for mobile handsets to offer our customers mobile services. 
Software Licenses. We license software products, including email and security software, and content, such as news feeds, from several suppliers for our internet services. The agreements for these products typically require us to pay a fee for software licenses and/or a share of advertising revenue for content licenses. For our TiVo service in the U.K., we have a partnership arrangement where TiVo is the provider of the user interface software for our next generation set-top boxes, which provides 
I-16


converged television and broadband internet capabilities. In 2017, we entered into a multi-year extension of our agreements with TiVo. For our mobile network operations and our fixed-line telephony services, we license software products, such as voicemail, text messaging and caller ID, from a variety of suppliers. For these licenses we seek to enter into long-term contracts, which generally require us to pay based on usage of the services.
For our mobile services provided through MVNO arrangements, we are dependent on third-party wireless network providers. Each of our MVNO operations has an agreement with such a provider to carry the mobile communications traffic of our customers. We seek to enter into medium to long-term arrangements for these services. Any termination of these arrangements could significantly impact our MVNO operated mobile services.
Competition
All of our businesses operate in highly competitive and rapidly evolving markets. The speed of technological advances and product innovations is likely to continue to increase, giving customers many options for telecommunications services. Our customers want access to high quality telecommunication products that provide seamless connectivity and experience. Accordingly, our ability to offer converged services (video, internet, fixed telephony and mobile) is a key component of our strategy. In many of our markets, we compete with companies that provide converged mobile and fixed-line services, as well as companies that are established in one or more communication products. Consequently, our businesses face significant competition. In all markets, we seek to differentiate our offerings by focusing on delivering quality high-speed internet at competitive prices and providing excellent customer service. In this section, we begin with an overview on the competitive nature of the broadband internet, video and mobile and fixed-line telephony services in our markets, and then provide information on key competitors in our more material markets.
We believe that our deep-fiber access provides us with several competitive advantages. For instance, our cable networks enable concurrent delivery of internet access, together with real-time television and VoD content, without impairing our high-speed internet service. In addition, our cable infrastructure allows us to provide triple-play bundled services of broadband internet, television and fixed-line telephony services without relying on a third-party service provider or network. Where mobile is available, our networks, together with our deep fiber access, allow us to provide a comprehensive set of converged mobile and fixed-line services. Our capacity is designed to support peak consumer demand, and our networks have been resilient despite significantly increased demand during the COVID-19 pandemic. In serving the business market, many aspects of the network can be leveraged at very low incremental costs given that business demand peaks at a time when consumer demand is low, and peaks at lower levels than consumer demand. 
Overall, we are experiencing increased convergence as customers look to receive all their media and communication services from one provider. In our largest video markets, our key competitors are: BT (U.K.), Proximus NV/SA (Proximus) (Belgium) and Swisscom (Switzerland). Also, as described above under Products and Services—Investments—VodafoneZiggo JV, the key competitor for the VodafoneZiggo JV is KPN. Each of these competitors have extensive resources allowing them to offer competitively priced bundled services. As a result, our ability to offer triple-play or quad-play bundles and fixed-mobile convergence bundles is one of our key strategies to attract and retain customers. We seek to distinguish ourselves through our multimedia gateway services, interactive video products (such as Replay TV and VoD), proprietary sports offerings, expanded content offers (for both in and out of the home) and our high-speed connectivity services backed by intelligent in-home WiFi solutions. 
Internet
With respect to broadband internet services and online content, our businesses face competition in a rapidly evolving marketplace from incumbent and non-incumbent telecommunications companies, mobile operators and cable-based ISPs, many of which have substantial resources. The internet services offered by these competitors include both fixed-line broadband internet via cable, DSL or FTTx networks and wireless broadband. These competitors have a range of product offerings with varying speeds and pricing, as well as interactive services, data and other non-video services offered to households and businesses. With the demand for mobile internet services increasing, competition from wireless services using various advanced technologies is an important competitive factor. In several of our markets, competitors offer high-speed mobile data via LTE networks as well as next generation 5G wireless technology which is in the active roll-out phase. In this intense competitive environment, internet speed and pricing are the key drivers for customers. 
Our strategy is seamless speed leadership. Our focus is on increasing the maximum speed of our connections while providing a reliable customer experience and offering a variety of service tiers, prices, bundled products and a range of value added services, including smart in-home connectivity solutions. We update our bundles and packages on an ongoing basis to meet the needs of our customers. Our ultra high download speed of 1Gbps is available in all of Belgium, Switzerland and substantially all of Ireland, as well as large parts of the U.K., Poland and Slovakia. We use our competitively priced ultra high-
I-17


speed internet services with access to Community WiFi to encourage customers to switch to our services from other providers. Our aim is to safeguard our high-end customer base and enable us to become more aggressive at the low- and medium-end of the internet market. By fully utilizing up to 1 Gbps technical capabilities of DOCSIS 3.1 technology on our cable systems, we can compete with any FTTx, DSL or LTE players today. 
Across Europe, our key competition in this product market is from the offering of broadband internet products using various FTTx and DSL-based technologies by the incumbent players and third parties. The introduction of cheaper and ever faster fixed-line broadband offerings is further increasing the competitive pressure in this market. A notable emerging factor is an overbuild of our networks with FTTx technology by the incumbent players and other third parties. At the moment, we do not consider our networks to be substantially overbuilt; however certain FTTx providers have announced upgrade plans that might indicate increased competition in the future. It is unclear if announced plans will be realized due to significant operational and financial challenges in rolling out FTTx. We are confident that our hybrid fiber-coaxial networks can be upgraded to higher speeds, to match or exceed potential FTTx based products. Furthermore, in some instances FTTx upgrades or new build could provide an opportunity for Liberty Global to take wholesale access and expand our geographical coverage.
We are expanding our ultra high-speed services and increasing our download speeds. In most of our markets, we offer our internet service on a standalone basis or through bundled offerings that include video, fixed-line telephony and mobile services. Mobile data is also increasingly important and we are addressing this through our mobile products and active expansion of the up to date wireless technology, including 5G.
•Virgin Media. In the U.K., we have a number of significant competitors in the market for broadband internet services, including fixed-line incumbent telecommunications providers. Of these broadband internet providers, BT is the largest, which provides broadband internet access services to both its own retail customers and third-party retail providers. BT has refocused its efforts to rollout a FTTx service supporting 1 Gbps speed to four million homes and businesses by March 2021 with the current plans to build FTTx in 107 locations, and a target to cover 20 million homes by 2030. As a result of these objectives, BT has launched a range of ultrafast consumer packages offering speeds of up to 900 Mbps. 
Operators such as Sky and TalkTalk deploy their own network access equipment in BT exchanges via a process known as local loop unbundling (LLU). This allows an operator to reduce the recurring operating costs charged by BT by reducing the proportion of traffic that must travel directly over BT’s network. LLU deployment requires a substantial capital investment to implement and requires a large customer base to deliver a return on investment. In addition, we currently see limited competition from mobile broadband developments, such as LTE and 5G mobile services and WiFi services.
•Telenet. In the Flanders region of Belgium, Telenet is the leading provider of residential broadband internet services. Telenet’s primary competitor is Proximus. Proximus is a well-established competitor offering quad-play bundles. Proximus’ DSL and VDSL services provide download speeds up to 100 Mbps. Moreover, Proximus offers up to 1 Gbps speed via its fiber network that is available in selected cities and being actively deployed. Similar to its video services, Telenet faces competition in the provision of internet services from other providers who have wholesale access to Telenet’s cable network. Through such access, Orange Belgium currently offers its mobile subscribers a triple-play bundle including enhanced video, mobile and fixed broadband internet services. In this competitive market, Telenet is using its fixed-mobile converged offers to promote its services.
•Sunrise UPC. In Switzerland, Swisscom is the largest provider of broadband internet services, and is Sunrise UPC’s primary competitor. It is also continuing to expand its FTTx network and roll out G.fast technology. Swisscom offers download speeds ranging from up to 50 Mbps to up to 10 Gbps, depending on the region. Swisscom continues to expand its FTTx network to Switzerland households in our footprint, as well as in our partner network footprints. It has built its FTTx network in several cities in cooperation with municipality-owned utility companies and, where no cooperation agreement has been reached, Swisscom is building its own FTTx network. Salt, a predominantly mobile player, also competes in this arena, with a focus on fixed-mobile convergence through a combination of FTTx and fixed wireless access technologies offering 10 Gbps internet speeds. In this competitive market, Sunrise UPC increased its introductory speed to 100 Mbps in line with market dynamics, is promoting its broadband services through its bundled offers and introduced a 1 Gbps service across its footprint. Moreover, the recent acquisition of Sunrise opens up vast opportunities to generate market synergies and further enhance Sunrise UPC’s competitive edge. Sunrise is a predominantly mobile player also focused on fixed-mobile convergence. To that end, Sunrise has looked to increase its FTTx network via fixed access agreements with Swisscom and utility fiber networks and its own fixed wireless access technologies. For more information on the Sunrise Acquisition, see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Video Distribution
Our video services compete primarily with traditional FTA broadcast television services, DTH satellite service providers, OTT and broadcaster VoD providers, as well as other fixed-line and mobile telecommunications carriers and broadband providers offering a similar range of video services. Many of these competitors have a national footprint and offer features, pricing and video services individually and in bundles comparable to what we offer. In certain markets, we also compete with other cable providers who have overbuilt portions of our systems.
OTT video content providers utilizing our or our competitors' high-speed internet connections are also a significant competitive factor, as are other video service providers that overlap our service areas. The OTT video providers (such as HBO Now, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, Disney+ and AppleTV+) offer VoD service for television series, movies and programming from broadcasters. Generally, the content libraries of such services are offered for a monthly fee. Typically these services are available on multiple devices in and out of the home. Moreover, broadcasters offer direct to customer content, including VoD, live and catch-up television via their own platforms (such as BBC iPlayer and RTL). To enhance our competitive position, we provide our subscribers with TV everywhere products and premium OTT video services through our online mobile apps, VoD and Replay TV services or through our arrangements with Netflix and Amazon, as well as YouTube and relevant local OTT VoD services. Our businesses also compete to varying degrees with other sources of information and entertainment, such as online entertainment, newspapers, magazines, books, live entertainment/concerts and sporting events. 
Our ability to attract and retain customers depends on our continued ability to acquire appealing content, provide easy to use services on acceptable terms and to deliver content on multiple devices inside and outside the home. Some competitors have obtained long-term exclusive contracts for certain programming, which limits the opportunities for other providers to offer such programs. Other competitors have obtained long-term exclusive contracts for programs, but our operations have limited access to certain of such programming through select contracts with these companies, including Sky and BT in the U.K. and Ireland. Moreover, telecommunication providers increasingly offer access to OTT platforms through their systems. For instance, Sky obtained significant competitive advantage through its deal to carry Disney on Sky’s set-top box. If exclusive content offerings increase through other providers, programming options could be a deciding factor for subscribers on selecting a video service. 
Similar to our technological advances in our video services (such as launches of Horizon 4, apps on 3rd party devices and all-IP TV box), our competitors are also improving their video platforms with next generation set-top boxes, TV everywhere products and other interactive services. Similarly, VDSL, which is either provided directly by the owner of the network or by a third-party, is a significant part of the competitive environment in many of our markets, as are FTTx networks. In all of our markets, competitive video services are offered by the incumbent telecommunications operator, whose strategies include video services over DSL, VDSL and FTTx networks and, in some cases, DTH and DTT. The ability of incumbent operators to offer the triple-play of broadband internet, video and fixed-line telephony services and, in most countries, a quad-play with mobile services, is exerting competitive pressure on our operations, including the pricing and bundling of our video products. In order to gain video market share, the incumbent operators and alternative service providers in a number of our larger markets are pricing their DTT, IPTV or DTH video packages at a discount to the retail price of the comparable digital cable service.
We compete on value by offering advanced digital services with a premier user interface, such as cloud recording and DVR functionality, HD/4K, VoD, voice control, OTT aggregation, Replay TV and multiscreen services via a superior user interface. We also compete by offering attractive content packages, as well as bundled services, at reasonable prices. In each of the countries where we operate, we tailor our packages to include attractive channel offerings and offer recurring discounts for bundled services and loyalty contracts, as well as integrated billing for OTT services. In addition, from time to time, we modify our digital channel offerings to improve the quality of our programming. Where mobile voice and data are available, we focus on our converged service offerings at attractive prices. In our other operations, we use the triple-play bundle as a means of driving video, as well as other products where convenience and price can be leveraged across the portfolio of services. We also continue to enhance our Horizon 4 platform to meet our customers’ desire to view programming anytime and anywhere, such as new applications and expanding its availability in our markets. 
•Virgin Media. Virgin Media’s digital television services compete primarily with FTA television and with Sky, the primary pay satellite television provider. Sky offers competitively priced triple-play and quad-play services in the U.K. and Ireland. Other significant competitors are BT and TalkTalk Telecom Group plc (TalkTalk) in the U.K. and Eircom Limited in Ireland, each of which offer triple-play services, as well as IPTV video services. Each of these competitors have multimedia home gateways.
Sky owns the U.K. rights to various entertainment, sports and movie programming content and channels. Sky is both a principal competitor in the pay-television market and an important supplier of content to us. Various Sky channels, including Sky Sports, are available over Sky’s satellite system and our cable networks, as well as via Sky’s apps and online players and other television platforms, and some of the channels are available on BT and TalkTalk platforms. 
I-19


Virgin Media distributes several basic and premium video channels supplied by Sky. BT is also both a principal competitor and an important supplier of content to us. BT owns premium BT Sport channels, providing a range of sports content, including football (soccer) from the English Premier League and exclusive rights to the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Europa League. The BT Sport channels are available on our cable network as well as our competitors’ networks. 
In this competitive market, Virgin Media is expanding its broadband network and promotes its 4K and HDR ready boxes running on its latest Horizon 4 platform (marketed as “Virgin TV360”) in the U.K. and in Ireland. The on-line streaming service Virgin TV Go is available throughout the Virgin Media footprint. Virgin Media customers also have access to third-party apps (e.g. Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and YouTube). In addition, Virgin Media’s ability to include mobile for its U.K. and Ireland customers for a low incremental fee creating a fixed-mobile convergence bundle is a key market offer. 
•Telenet. Telenet’s principal competitor is Proximus, the incumbent telecommunications operator, which has interactive digital television, replay television, VoD, OTT and HD service as part of its video offer, as well as mobile-only video propositions tailored to the needs of younger market segments. Proximus offers customers a wide range of both individual and bundled services at competitive prices. Also, Telenet and other Belgian cable operators must give alternative providers access to their cable networks. Orange Belgium N.V. (Orange Belgium) gained such access in 2016 and currently offers its mobile subscribers a triple play bundle, including mobile, enhanced video and broadband internet services. Telenet may face increased competition from other providers of video services who take advantage of the wholesale access and may be able to offer triple- and quad-play services. For more information on wholesale access, see Regulatory Matters—Belgium. 
In order to compete effectively against alternative providers, Telenet leverages its extensive cable network, the broad acceptance of its basic cable television services and Yelo Play and its additional features, such as HD and DVR functionality, VoD offerings, its Play Sports channel and original programming (e.g. Chaussée d'Amour and De Dag) delivered via the Horizon 4 multimedia box. Telenet is able to offer international, national, regional and local content, including Dutch-language broadcasts, to its subscribers. It is also using mobile services to drive its other products through its converged offerings. In addition, Telenet continues to enhance its Yelo Play and Horizon Go apps as well as programming and the addition of sports rights. 
•Sunrise UPC. Our main competitor in Switzerland is Swisscom, the incumbent telecommunications operator, which provides IPTV services over DSL, VDSL and FTTx networks. Swisscom offers VoD services, DVR and replay functionality, HD channels and has exclusive rights to distribute certain sports programming. Swisscom launched an advanced set-top box in the market with voice control, Smart Home integration and content aggregation beyond video, such as music streaming and gaming services. Although its presence is limited, Salt focuses on value propositions by including TV within their bundles and providing access to OTT via Apple TV. In this saturated market, price competition and high promotional intensity are significant factors. To compete effectively in Switzerland, Sunrise UPC is promoting Horizon 4 (marketed as “UPC TV”) and related family of products together with Replay TV and VoD, giving subscribers the ability to personalize their programming and viewing preferences while delivering excellent user interface with voice control. Sunrise UPC has its own sports channel, My Sports and aggregates third-party apps (e.g. Netflix and YouTube). Sunrise UPC uses its high-speed internet service with speeds of up to 1 Gbps to promote its extended digital bundles and offer mobile services. The recent acquisition of Sunrise is expected to further strengthen Sunrise UPC’s position in the national video market. For more information on the Sunrise Acquisition, see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Mobile and Telephony Services 
    In Belgium, as a mobile network operator, we are one of the larger mobile providers based on number of SIM cards. We also substantially expanded our mobile business with the acquisition of Sunrise in Switzerland and new MVNO arrangements with Vodafone in the U.K. In our other European markets, however, we currently have limited mobile presence. In the markets where we are a large mobile provider, we continue to deploy additional bandwidth to deliver our wide range of services to our customers and expand our LTE and 5G services. Where we are a small mobile provider, we face significant competition from other mobile telephony providers, many of whom offer LTE and 5G services and are making significant advances acquiring customers. In all of our markets competition is intense. We offer various calling plans, such as unlimited calling, national or international calling, unlimited off-peak calling and minute packages, including calls to fixed and mobile phones. In addition, we use our bundled offers with our video and ultra high-speed internet services to gain mobile subscribers. Our ability to offer fixed-mobile convergence services is a key driver.
I-20


    The market for fixed-line telephony services is saturated in almost all of our markets. Changes in market share are driven by the combination of price and quality of services provided and the inclusion of telephony services in bundled offerings. Our fixed-line telephony services compete against the incumbent telecommunications operators. In all of our markets, we also compete with other VoIP operators offering service across broadband lines. OTT telephony is another competitive factor. In addition, our businesses face competition from other cable telephony providers, FTTx-based providers or other indirect access providers. 
    Competition in both the residential and business fixed-line telephony markets is extremely competitive due to market trends, the offering of carrier pre-select services, number portability, the replacement of fixed-line with mobile telephony and the growth of VoIP services, as well as continued deregulation of telephony markets and general price competition. Our fixed-line telephony strategy is focused around value leadership, and we position our services as “anytime” or “any destination”. Our portfolio of calling plans include a variety of innovative calling options designed to meet the needs of our subscribers. In many of our markets, we provide product innovation, such as telephone apps that allow customers to make and receive calls from their fixed-line call packages and voice over WiFi to allow telephony even with no mobile reception. In addition, we offer varying plans to meet customer needs and, similar to our mobile services, we use our telephony bundle options with our digital video and internet services to help promote our telephony services and flat rate offers are standard.
In each of our markets, we face competition with a dominant fixed-line telephony provider, most of which also have competitive mobile offers based on LTE or 5G services. In our largest markets, the key dominant telephony providers are BT (U.K.), Proximus (Belgium) and Swisscom (Switzerland). These telephony competitors are also the largest mobile operators in these markets based on number of SIM cards. These competitors include their mobile products in bundles with fixed-line services. Moreover, there is a fundamental shift in customer preference towards mobile. As a result, we expect fixed telephony users to decline in favor of mobile connectivity.
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2020, we, including our consolidated subsidiaries, had an aggregate of approximately 23,000 full-time equivalent employees, including approximately 121 in the United States, but excluding contractors and temporary employees. Our purpose – Tomorrow’s Connections Today – is fundamental to what Liberty Global stands for and represents the shared ambition of our employees, customers and the communities in which we live and operate.

I-21


being of our employees and customers while maintaining the highest-quality video, voice and broadband services, despite exceptional demands on our networks. For employees, we expanded work-from-home plans and increased health measures within our offices. We have made available a series of well-being resources based on a four-pronged strategy focused on the mental, physical, social and financial aspects of health and well-being. We also established a $4 million response fund to help employees and their families significantly affected by the crisis. Our executive leadership team and board of directors pledged $2 million to the response fund, which was matched by our company to support our employees in need.
We measure employee engagement on a quarterly basis against external benchmarks defined by an outside organization that provides employee engagement insights to hundreds of the world’s leading organizations. We are performing in line with global industry benchmarks, and we exceed benchmarks set by high performing organizations in areas such as in inclusion, well-being, manager support and senior leadership communication. The high performing organization norm is comprised of organizations with strong financial performance and superior human resource practices, representing the gold standard for employee engagement. Results are owned by managers and executives, who are accountable for setting out action plans. In addition, we gather regular qualitative and quantitative insights with methods such as pulse surveys and focus groups. This approach informs decision making across key employee focus areas, including for example, well-being, targeted support during the COVID-19 pandemic, and skills development. 
Regulatory Matters 
General Overview - E.U., U.K. and Switzerland
Video distribution, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and mobile businesses are regulated in each of the countries in which we operate. The scope of regulation varies from country to country, although in some significant respects regulation in European markets is harmonized under the regulatory structure of the European Union (E.U.).
Adverse regulatory developments could subject our businesses to a number of risks. Regulation could limit growth, revenue and the number and type of services offered, leading to increased operating costs and property and equipment additions. Moreover, regulation may restrict our operations and subject them to further competitive pressure, including pricing restrictions, interconnect and other access obligations, and restrictions or controls on content. Failure to comply with current or future regulation could expose our businesses to various penalties.
As of February 1, 2021, the E.U. includes 27 Member States; namely, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden. As such, these countries are required to harmonize certain laws with E.U. rules by transposing directives into their national law. In addition, other types of E.U. rules (or regulations) are directly enforceable in those countries without any implementation at the national level. 
The United Kingdom (U.K.) formally left the E.U. on January 31, 2020, commonly referred to as “Brexit”, and entered into a transition period until December 31, 2020. On December 24, 2020, the U.K. and the E.U. reached the “Trade and Cooperation Agreement” referred to as the “E.U.-U.K. Agreement”. On December 30, 2020, the E.U.-U.K. Agreement was approved by the U.K. Parliament, with retrospective ratification from the E.U. Parliament expected to follow in 2021. In the meantime, the E.U.-U.K. Agreement has been provisionally brought into effect. The E.U.-U.K. Agreement focuses on four main sectors, namely (1) trade, (2) economic and social cooperation, (3) security and (4) governance. Trade in goods between the E.U. and the U.K. will take place on a zero tariff and zero quota basis. Additionally, even though checks will apply to all traded goods, customs procedures will be simplified. Principles on state aid are also contained in the E.U.-U.K. Agreement to prevent either side from granting unfair subsidies, and a dispute settlement mechanism is provided to ensure businesses from the E.U. and the U.K. compete on a level playing field. In the services sector, the U.K. will no longer benefit from the freedom to supply services across the E.U., and free movement of persons between the E.U. and the U.K. has ended. In addition, the E.U.-U.K. Agreement does not cover audiovisual services. With respect to data movement between the two regions, the E.U. will allow personal data to flow to the U.K. for four months (extendable to six months) without any changes, as it continues its adequacy assessment of the U.K.’s data protection regime, while the U.K. indicated that free flow of data to the E.U. will be allowed. In relation to the telecommunications sector, the U.K. and the E.U. have agreed to maintain the existing levels of liberalization in their markets, including standard provisions on authorizations, access to and use of telecoms networks, interconnection, fair and transparent regulation and the allocation of scarce resources. Service providers from either the E.U. or the U.K. will not have to wait for prior authorization before they deliver services. The E.U.-U.K. Agreement contains measures to encourage cooperation on the promotion of fair and transparent rates for international mobile roaming. The effects of Brexit could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, as more fully detailed in Item 1A. Risk Factors 
I-22


included in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. There can be no assurance that future U.K. policy in this area will remain as favorable to our company as is currently the case. 
Regulation in Switzerland, which is not a Member State of the E.U., is discussed separately below, as well as regulations in certain Member States in which we face regulatory issues that may have a material impact on our business.
E.U. Communications Regulation
The European Electronic Communications Code (the Code) is the primary source of communications regulation in the European Union. The Code came into effect on December 20, 2018 and had to be transposed by the Member States into national law by December 21, 2020. Most Member States are reported to be late with the implementation of the changes that were prescribed by the Code.
The Code primarily seeks to develop open markets for communication services within Europe. It harmonizes the rules within the E.U. for the establishment and operation of electronic communication networks, including cable television and traditional telephony networks, and the offer of electronic communication services, such as telephony (including OTT services), internet and, to some degree, television services. 
Set forth below are certain key provisions included in the Code. This description is not intended to be a comprehensive or exhaustive description of all regulation in this area. 
•Licensing and Exclusivity. The Code requires Member States to abolish exclusivities on communication networks and services in their territory and allow service providers into their markets based on a simple registration. The Code sets forth an exhaustive list of conditions that may be imposed on communication networks and services. Possible obligations include, among other things, financial charges for universal service or for the costs of regulation, environmental requirements, data privacy and other consumer protection rules, “must carry” obligations, provision of customer information to law enforcement agencies and access obligations. 
•Significant Market Power. Specific obligations imposed by National Regulatory Authoritis (NRAs) in E.U. Member States apply only to service providers deemed to have Significant Market Power (defined below) in a relevant market. For purposes of the Code, a service provider has “Significant Market Power” where, either individually or jointly with others, it enjoys a position of significant economic strength, affording it the power to behave independently of competitors, customers and consumers to an appreciable extent. 
As part of the implementation of certain provisions of the Code, NRAs are required to analyze certain markets predefined by the European Commission to determine if any service provider has Significant Market Power. NRAs may, however, perform analysis of other markets, applying an additional test, called the three criteria test, which looks at the competitiveness of the market during the regulatory period, existence of barriers to market entry and the sufficiency of competition law to deal with market issues.
In the event that a service provider is found to have Significant Market Power in any particular market, single or jointly with another provider, an NRA could impose certain conditions on that service provider. The European Commission has the power to veto a finding by an NRA of Significant Market Power (or the absence thereof), which power also applies with respect to market definition. The European Commission does not, however, have the power to veto any remedies, such as access obligations, imposed as a result of a finding of Significant Market Power. We have been found to have Significant Market Power in certain markets in which we operate and further findings of Significant Market Power are possible.
•Video Services. The regulation of distribution, but not the content, of television services to the public is harmonized by the Code. Member States are allowed to impose on certain service providers under their jurisdiction reasonable must carry obligations for the transmission of specified radio and television broadcast channels. Such obligations are required to be based on clearly defined general interest objectives, be proportionate and transparent and are subject to periodic review. We are subject to must carry regulations in all markets in which we operate, which are different among Member States. We do not expect the European Commission or the Member States to curtail such obligations in the foreseeable future.
Net Neutrality, Roaming and Call Termination
In November 2015, the European Parliament adopted the regulation on the first E.U.-wide net neutrality regime. The regulation, which is directly applicable in all Member States, permits the provision of specialized services, optimized for specific content and subjects service providers to reasonable traffic management requirements. The regulation also abolished 
I-23


retail roaming tariffs beginning in June 2017 and introduced wholesale roaming price caps. In 2019, the E.U. also introduced caps on wholesale rates for intra-E.U. calls (i.e. calls from the users’ Member State of residence to another Member State) to bring these in line with the wholesale roaming caps.
Call termination tariffs are set by NRAs following an assessment of the relevant mobile and fixed call termination markets. The Code introduced the system of single maximum E.U.-wide voice termination rates for fixed and mobile. On December 18, 2020, the European Commission adopted a delegated regulation directly applicable in all Member States, which sets the maximum termination rates that service providers are allowed to charge each other for mobile and fixed termination services. By 2022, all fixed service providers will be subject to a maximum fixed termination rate of €0.07 per minute and by 2024 the single maximum rate for mobile termination will be €0.2 per minute.
Broadcasting and Content Law
Although the distribution of video channels by a service provider is within the scope of the Code, the activities of a broadcaster are harmonized by other elements of E.U. law, in particular the Audiovisual Media Services Directive (AVMSD). The AVMSD was revised and reissued on December 18, 2018. E.U. Member States were required to implement the revised AVMSD into national law by September 19, 2020; however, a number of Member States are reported to be late with implementation. 
Generally, broadcasts originating in and intended for reception within an E.U. Member State must respect the laws of that Member State. Pursuant to the AVMSD, however, E.U. Member States are required to allow broadcast signals of broadcasters established in another E.U. Member State to be freely transmitted within their territory, so long as the broadcaster complies with the law of their home state. This is referred to as the country of origin principle and applies to both linear and non-linear services. In addition, when we offer third-party VoD services on our network, it is the business of the third-party provider of the services, and not us as the distributor, that is regulated in respect of these services. 
The AVMSD established quotas, applicable to both linear and non-linear services, for the transmission of European-produced programming and programs made by European producers who are independent of broadcasters. Such obligations are applicable to certain of our businesses. 
Member States are also allowed to require service providers to contribute financially to the production of European works, including requiring financial contributions from VoD providers established in other territories that targets audiences in their jurisdiction. Such obligations are applicable to (or are expected to become applicable to) certain of our businesses.
In addition, according to the regulation of the European Commission addressing the portability of online audiovisual content services, commercial providers of online content services (including OTT service providers) are required to enable subscribers who are temporarily present in any Member State with access and use of online content services in substantially the same manner as in the Member State of residence. Our services comply with these portability requirements. 
Copyright Law
In April 2019, the European Commission adopted a new directive relating to satellite and cable retransmissions. The directive introduces a new country of origin principle in relation to online content, extends the existing copyright clearance system to other technologies (such as satellite, mobile and IPTV) and extends a similar rights clearance system to directly injected cable channels. Member States are required to transpose the majority of this directive into national law by June 2021.
Technological Regulation
The European Commission is increasingly imposing additional mandatory requirements and encouraging voluntary solutions regarding energy consumption of the telecommunications equipment we provide our customers. We have been participating in discussions and studies regarding energy consumption with the European Commission and with experts working on their behalf. In addition, we have been working to lower power consumption of our set-top boxes. We have also worked with a large group of companies to create a voluntary agreement on set-top box power consumption as an alternative to regulation, which has been formally recognized by the European Commission. Nevertheless, legislation in this area may be adopted that could adversely affect the cost and/or the functionality of equipment we deploy to customers. 
Pursuant to an E.U. Regulation on standby power (the Standby Regulation), many devices are required to have either a low power standby mode or off mode, unless such mode is inappropriate for the intended use of the product. In particular, the Standby Regulation sets, among others, the maximum power consumption of networked consumer equipment while in the so-called “Networked Standby” mode. As a result, all of the devices we purchase and/or develop operate under the power management requirements of the Standby Regulation and are subject to audit to ensure compliance.

Also, the Radio Equipment Directive, which has been transposed into national legislation by E.U. Member States, establishes a regulatory framework for placing radio equipment on the market. Its objective is a single market for radio equipment by setting essential requirements for safety and health, electromagnetic compatibility, and the efficient use of the radio spectrum. It also provides the basis for further regulation governing some additional aspects, including technical features for the protection of privacy, personal data and fraud, interoperability, access to emergency services, and compliance regarding the combination of radio equipment and software. It also takes into account the need for improved market surveillance, especially for the traceability obligations of manufacturers, importers and distributors. As a result, all of the devices we purchase and/or develop which contain radio interfaces (such as WiFi), must operate under these rules. 
There is a Mutual Recognition Agreement established between the E.U. and Switzerland for the purpose of mutual recognition of conformity assessment of regulated products. As a result, the Standby Regulation and the Radio Equipment Directive are also applicable in Switzerland.
As part of the E.U.’s Radio Spectrum Policy Program, spectrum made available through the switch off of analog television has been approved for mobile broadband. This spectrum, known as the “digital dividend”, is in the 700 - 862 MHz band. The terms under which this spectrum becomes available varies among the European countries in which we operate. Certain uses of this spectrum may interfere with services carried on our cable networks. If this occurs, we may need to: (1) avoid using certain frequencies on our cable networks for certain or all of our services, (2) make some changes to our networks, or (3) change the equipment that we deploy. In approving mobile broadband, however, the Radio Spectrum Policy Program states that the new mobile services must co-exist with existing services, such as cable and DTT, to avoid harmful interference. As a result, we are in ongoing discussions with relevant Member States and the European Commission to develop mitigation techniques and to engage NRAs to launch regulatory dialog with equipment manufacturers and mobile providers to develop co-existing networks.
Other European Level Regulation
In addition to the industry-specific regimes discussed above, our operating companies must comply with a range of both specific and general legislation concerning data protection, competition, consumer protection and cybersecurity, among other matters. 
In May 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) with respect to data protection and retention became effective in the E.U. The GDPR sets strict standards regarding the handling, use and retention of personal data. Organizations that fail to comply face stiff penalties. As required, our operations have implemented various measures internally and with third-party vendors to meet these requirements. In addition, in January 2017, the European Commission published a proposal for a new e-Privacy regulation, replacing the current e-Privacy Directive that regulates privacy related issues in the electronic communications sector. Negotiations among E.U. Member States are still in process, and the proposal still needs to go through the legislative process.
With respect to cybersecurity, in 2016, the E.U. adopted a directive on security of network and information systems (NIS Directive), which provides legal measures to boost the overall level of cybersecurity in the E.U. In principle, our operations within the E.U. do not fall under the NIS Directive as it exempts providers of Electronic Communications Services, which are governed by the E.U. telecommunications framework. Exceptions to this are some national national transpositions of the NIS Directive, for instance in the Netherlands and Ireland, which require our network and communication equipment to be compliant with such obligations. In addition, in December 2020, the European Commission presented a revised version of the current NIS Directive as part of a new cybersecurity strategy. The legislative proposal seeks to expand the scope of the current NIS Directive by adding new sectors based on their criticality for the economy and society, including telecoms providers, which would imply stricter enforcement regimes in the future. The proposal still needs to go through the legislative process and adoption by E.U. institutions.
In December 2020, the European Commission also published the Digital Services Act (DSA) legislative proposal to replace the 2000 E-Commerce Directive. The DSA sets clear responsibilities and accountability for providers of intermediary services, especially improving the mechanisms for the removal of illegal content and for the effective protection of users’ fundamental rights online. The DSA proposal, which complements sector-specific legislation such as the AVMSD, still needs to go through the legislative process and is expected to have limited impact on us. 
Additionally, in December 2020, the European Commission published a legislative proposal concerning a new Digital Markets Act (DMA). The DMA aims to tackle unfair practices carried out by digital platforms acting as gatekeepers on the market and only applies to major providers of core platform services, such as search engines, social networks and online intermediation services. The DMA requires proactive action and prohibits a number of practices by such digital platforms with respect to interoperability and data sharing. The DMA proposal still needs to go through the legislative process and is expected to have limited impact on us.
I-25


Our operating companies are also subject to both national and European level regulations on competition and on consumer protection, which are broadly harmonized at the E.U. level and largely regulated under the Code. For example, while our operating companies may offer their services in bundled packages in European markets, they are sometimes not permitted to make a subscription to one service, such as cable television, conditional upon a subscription to another service, such as telephony. They may also face restrictions on the degree to which they may discount certain products included in the bundled packages.
United Kingdom
The U.K. Office of Communications (Ofcom) is the key regulatory authority for the communications sector in which Virgin Media operates in the U.K. It is responsible for furthering the interests of citizens in relation to communications matters and furthering the interests of consumers in relevant markets where appropriate by promoting competition. Ofcom is also responsible for regulating the BBC, a role previously undertaken by the BBC Trust. In December 2020, it was also announced that Ofcom has been appointed the regulatory body responsible for online harms in the U.K., but the legislation which underpins the regulatory framework, the Online Safety Bill, still needs to progress through Government and Parliament before being passed. The U.K. Competition and Markets Authority has jurisdiction with respect to competition matters. 
End of Contract Notifications and Annual Best Tariff Notifications. In 2019, Ofcom issued new regulatory requirements originating from the European Electronic Communications Code, that, effective from February 2020, obligate providers to (i) alert customers who are approaching the end of a minimum contract term to the fact that their contract period is coming to an end and to set out the best new price that the provider can offer them and (ii) once a year, alert customers who are out of contract to that fact and again confirm the best new price the provider can offer them. In both cases, providers must also set out the price available to new customers for an equivalent service offering. These new requirements adversely impacted our revenue and increased certain of our costs in the U.K. during 2020, and we expect additional and potentially more significant adverse impacts on our operating results in the U.K. in future periods.
Broadband Expansion. At the end of 2019, super-fast broadband was available to more than 95% of U.K. premises. To stimulate private investment in this endeavor, the U.K. government has been using money from the publicly funded BBC license fee, underspend from the Analogue TV Switch-Off Project and other sources of public investment. The state aid measure permitting this subsidy was renewed (and amended) in 2016 and is expected, through amendments to its “underspend” provisions, to result in up to an additional 1% to 2% super-fast coverage, making it available to 97%-98% of the population by the end of 2020. 
The U.K. government has also been supporting the market rollout of full fiber and 5G services. Such support has included public funding for the creation of a match-funded “full fiber deployment” fund, business rate relief for the deployment of new full fiber networks and public funding for a strategic program of full fiber and 5G trials. The U.K. government’s November 2017 budget included £190.0 million ($259.4 million) for the first and second phases of its local full fiber deployment fund and £160.0 million ($218.4 million) for the first phase of the 5G trials. In the second half of 2019, the U.K. government set out its ambition for all premises to have access to a gigabit capable service by the end of 2025. To facilitate this, it announced a gigabit capability public fund of £5 billion ($7 billion) for areas that are not commercially viable. As further detailed in the U.K. government’s Spending Review issued in November 2020, £1.2 billion of the £5 billion gigabit capability fund would be available to subsidize the rollout of gigabit-capable broadband in the hardest to reach areas of the U.K. between now and 2025, with the possibility of additional draw downs from the gigabit capability fund if industry has the capacity to use such funds. In addition, the National Infrastructure Strategy, which was published alongside the Spending Review, highlighted that the U.K. government is now working with industry to target a minimum of 85% gigabit capable coverage by 2025, while seeking to accelerate rollout further to get as close to 100% as possible.
The Telecommunications Infrastructure Bill received Royal Assent in February 2018, which gave effect to the U.K. government’s plans to provide full business rate relief for new fiber infrastructure built during the 2017-2022 rating period. Secondary legislation followed in April 2018, clarifying that the relief also applies to newly lit fiber and any plant and machinery used to build the infrastructure. In addition, the U.K. government published its Telecoms Infrastructure Review in July 2018. This Review explored whether the conditions for investment in fiber are optimal in the U.K. and what policy changes should be considered to encourage greater investment in new digital infrastructure. The Government concluded that, with the right policy support, infrastructure based competition will deliver FTTP/Gbit capable networks to approximately 90% of U.K. premises. To facilitate this, the U.K. government intends to introduce a notification regime for multiple dwelling unit wayleaves, introduce a requirement for new housing developments to have Gbit capable access and increase consistency in street works and duct access. To this end, following consultation, the Telecommunications Infrastructure (Leasehold Property) Bill was presented to parliament in October 2019 and is expected to be passed in 2021, with the bill currently awaiting its third reading in the House of Lords. New building regulations requiring new housing developments to have Gbit capable access are expected to be consulted on in the first quarter of 2021 and made law during the first half of 2021. The U.K. government conducted its fundamental review into business rates over the summer of 2020 and is expected to publish its recommendations in the first half of 2021. 
I-26


In November 2015, the U.K. government announced that everyone would have a legal right to request a broadband connection of at least 10 Mbps regardless of where they live. To facilitate this, a broadband Universal Service Obligation (USO) was introduced via secondary legislation, which took effect in March 2020. The USO is aimed, in particular, at addressing the final 5% of the population in the U.K. without access to a broadband connection of a reasonable speed. Ofcom is responsible for implementation, including designation of the Universal Service Providers (USPs), currently BT and KCOM Group PLC. Additionally, Ofcom is responsible for deciding whether the USO constitutes an “unfair burden” on the USPs and, if so, designing an industry funding mechanism to compensate the USPs. In May 2020, Ofcom issued a statement confirming its approach to assessing any unfair burden claims as well as determining which operators would be required to contribute to a universal service industry fund. Ofcom allows USPs to request Ofcom’s review of potential compensation claims for any efficiently incurred ‘unfair net cost burden’ once per year. If Ofcom accepts a request for review, it will consider whether it is fair for the USP to bear some or all of the burden, as well as consider the cost to Ofcom and the industry of establishing and administering an industry fund. The net burden would be assessed based on the incremental cost of delivering the USO, less the benefits associated with being the USP. Ofcom intends to determine which operators would contribute to the fund and how much they would contribute at a later date. Ofcom has also indicated the USPs cannot make this request any earlier than March 2021. In the meantime, the number of consumers who would be eligible for the universal service is expected to decline, as providers continue to upgrade and expand their networks.
Television and VoD Services. In the U.K., Virgin Media is required to hold individual licenses under the Broadcasting Acts 1990 and 1996 for any television channels (including barker channels), which Virgin Media owns or operates and for the provision of certain other services on its cable television platform, such as electronic program guides. These television licensable content service (TLCS) licenses are granted and administered by Ofcom. Under these licenses, each covered service must comply with a number of Ofcom codes, including the Broadcasting Code, and with all directions issued by Ofcom. Breach of any of the terms of a TLCS license may result in the imposition of fines on the license holder and, ultimately, the license being revoked.
As a provider of an on-demand program service (ODPS), Virgin Media must comply with a number of statutory obligations in relation to “editorial content” and notify Ofcom of its intention to provide an ODPS. Failure to notify Ofcom or comply with the relevant statutory obligations may result in the imposition of fines or, ultimately, the prohibition on providing an ODPS.
New Security Regulations. In November 2020, the U.K. government introduced the Telecoms Security Bill, which will impose a new security framework on telecoms providers and provide the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport with new powers to direct telecoms providers to remove High Risk Vendors (HRVs) from their networks. The bill is expected to be passed into law by the spring of 2021. 
Regulation of Broadband Markets. In March 2018, Ofcom completed its latest review of the Wholesale Local Access market (incorporating physical or passive network access via methods such as LLU and duct access). Ofcom found that BT continues to hold Significant Market Power and imposed corresponding remedies on it until April 2021. These remedies include price controls on “virtual” access to its wholesale 40/10Mbps FTTx product, the maintenance of access and pricing controls on its wholesale copper products and improvements to the existing physical infrastructure access product (third-party access to BT’s duct and pole estate).
Future Approach to Regulation. In July 2018, Ofcom published a Strategic Policy Position, setting out its intended future approach to regulation from April 2021 (aimed at creating regulatory certainty to support investment in full fiber broadband). It includes an intention to take a more holistic consideration of business and residential markets (ultimately combining previously separate markets) and to consider different regulatory approaches in different parts of the country, reflecting the varying levels of network competition. In January 2020, Ofcom published the provisional conclusions from its holistic review of the residential broadband and business connectivity markets, setting out its intended approach to regulating them (to apply for a five year period beginning in April 2021) . It proposes to categorize areas of the country and apply regulation depending on the level of competition in those areas. In both non-competitive areas (~30% of premises) and in potentially competitive areas (~70% of premises), BT Openreach will continue to be required to provide wholesale access to its network; however, in the latter such wholesale access will be limited to BT Openreach’s entry-level superfast broadband service and the price will rise in line with inflation. Although Ofcom has not identified any competitive areas at this stage, once it does so, all regulation will be lifted from those areas.
Ofcom intends to regulate BT Openreach’s wholesale business connections (or “leased lines”) in a similar way to residential broadband by varying its approach geographically to reflect the level of current or prospective competition and increasing charges in line with inflation.
Ofcom Review of Business Connectivity Markets. Ofcom published the conclusions of its last review of the business connectivity (leased lines) market in the third quarter of 2019. The review maintained the existing approach, to market 
I-27


definition, (flat) price caps for some wholesale BT services and a narrow dark fibre remedy on BT (in areas where infrastructure competition is non-existent and unlikely to occur). It also introduced an extension of the duct and pole remedy applying to BT to enable its use for (standalone) business grade services. Ofcom published its latest review of the business connectivity market in January 2020, as part of the broader, holistic review of the connectivity markets (see above under Future Approach to Regulation).
Mobile Service. Prior to January 1, 2021, as an MVNO, Virgin Media was subject to E.U. regulations relating to retail prices for roaming services. These regulations: set limits on certain wholesale tariffs for international mobile voice roaming, SMS tariffs and data roaming within the E.U.; provided for greater levels of transparency of retail pricing information; imposed measures to guard against bill shock in respect of data roaming; and prohibited the imposition of additional retail charges for roaming within the E.U. Following the expiration of the Brexit transition period on December 31, 2020, the U.K. is no longer subject to the same E.U. regulations. Instead, the Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the E.U. and the U.K. simply states that the parties will endeavor to cooperate on promoting transparent and reasonable rates for international mobile roaming services. However, the U.K. previously introduced a number of consumer measures aimed at providing safeguards for consumers, which will continue to apply. Such measures include limits on the amount that customers can be charged for using mobile data abroad before having to opt in if they wish to use more data and alert warnings as customers reach various milestones in data allowances included within their packages.
Mobile termination charges applied by mobile network operators are regulated by Ofcom under a Significant Market Power charge control condition. Under Virgin Media’s MVNO agreement, these mobile termination charges are passed on to Virgin Media. Ofcom has set mobile termination charges for the period of 2018-2021, with rates reducing by approximately 5% from their starting levels by the end of this period. In August 2020, Ofcom launched a consultation on its review of the Wholesale Voice Markets 2021-26, which seeks to regulate both fixed and mobile voice markets beginning in April 2021. In its consultation, Ofcom proposed to continue to impose caps on the charges for terminating both mobile and fixed calls.
Fixed Voice Termination. Virgin Media has been designated as a provider with Significant Market Power on fixed voice termination. As a result, the rates it charges other providers for termination on its network are subject to regulation. This requires, among other things, the provision of termination on fair and reasonable terms, conditions and charges, which must be no higher than BT’s regulated charges, unless certain conditions are met. 
Belgium
The Belgisch Instituut voor Post en Telecommunicate (the BIPT), the Belgian NRA, has determined that Telenet is an operator with Significant Market Power in the market for call termination on an individual fixed public telephone network. Reciprocal termination rates have been imposed, which results in Telenet charging the interconnection rate of the incumbent telecommunications operator, Proximus. BIPT has confirmed a wholesale tariff of €0.116 ($0.14) per minute, which is currently in effect.
BIPT has adopted a bottom-up long run incremental cost model to calculate tariffs for call termination on individual mobile networks, resulting in a nominal value of €0.99 ($1.21) per minute, which is currently in effect. BIPT has also designated Telenet, as a mobile network operator, as having Significant Market Power in the market for “call termination on individual networks.”
In 2011, BIPT and the regional regulators for the media sectors (together, the Belgium Regulatory Authorities) found Telenet to have Significant Market Power in the broadcasting market (the 2011 Decision). The 2011 Decision imposed on Telenet an obligation to provide third-party operators, at specified “retail minus” tariff rates, with (1) a resale offer of an analog television package, (2) access to digital television platforms and (3) a resale offer of broadband internet access in combination with the digital television access obligation. 
In 2018 the Belgium Regulatory Authorities adopted a market review decision (the 2018 Decision), which replaced the 2011 Decision. The 2018 Decision finds that Telenet has Significant Market Power in the wholesale broadband market. The obligations include (1) providing third-party operators with access to the digital television platform (including basic digital video and analog video) and (2) making available to third-party operators a bitstream offer of broadband internet access (including fixed voice as an option). Telenet considered the 2018 Decision to be inconsistent with the principle of technology-neutral regulation and the European Single Market Strategy to stimulate further investments in broadband networks. Telenet filed an appeal with the Brussels Markets Court that was rejected on September 4, 2019.
The 2018 Decision no longer applied a retail minus pricing on Telenet, and instead, it imposed a 17% reduction in monthly wholesale cable resale access prices during an interim period before setting “reasonable access tariffs”. On May 26, 2020, the Belgium Regulatory Authorities adopted a final decision regarding the “reasonable access tariffs” to replace the interim prices, 
I-28


which represents an estimated decrease of 11.5%, as compared to the initial August 1, 2018 interim rates, and is applicable as of July 1, 2020. These rates are expected to evolve over time due to, among other reasons, broadband capacity usage. 
The 2018 Decision aims to, and in its application, may strengthen Telenet’s competitors by granting them resale access to Telenet’s network to offer competing products and services notwithstanding Telenet’s substantial historical financial outlays in developing the infrastructure. In addition, any resale access granted to competitors could (1) limit the bandwidth available to Telenet to provide new or expanded products and services to the customers served by its network and (2) adversely impact Telenet’s ability to maintain or increase its revenue and cash flows. The extent of any such adverse impacts ultimately will be dependent on the extent that competitors take advantage of the resale access afforded to Telenet’s network, the rates that Telenet receives for such access and other competitive factors or market developments.
Switzerland
Switzerland has a regulatory system that partially reflects the principles of the E.U., but otherwise is distinct from the European regulatory system of telecommunications. The Telecommunications Act (Fernmeldegesetz) regulates, in general, the transmission of information, including the transmission of radio and television signals. Most aspects of the distribution of radio and television, however, are regulated under the Radio and Television Act (Bundesgesetz über Radio und Fernsehen). In addition, the Competition Act, the Data Protection Act and the Act on the Surveillance of Post and Telecommunications are potentially relevant to our business. With respect to energy consumption of electronic home devices, the Energy Act and the Energy Ordinance are applicable to set-top boxes and modems. 
Providers of telecommunication services using resources attributed to Switzerland’s Federal Office of Communications (such as addressing elements and licensed radio frequencies) must register with the Federal Office of Communications. Dominant providers must grant access to their network to third parties, including LLU access; however, it is restricted to the copper wire network of the incumbent, Swisscom. Therefore, such unbundling obligations do not apply to our business in Switzerland and other cable operators. Also, any dominant provider must grant access to its ducts, subject to sufficient capacity being available in the relevant duct. At this time, only Swisscom has been determined to be dominant in this regard. Dominant operators are obliged to provide interconnection and all providers of services forming part of the universal service in Switzerland have to ensure interoperability of services.
    In regards to call termination as part of interconnection agreements, Swisscom as market dominant provider, must offer these services at cost-oriented prices and disclose the conditions and prices for their individual access services. In interconnection agreements with Swisscom, reciprocal termination rates are imposed. 
    The final Telecommunications Act and corresponding ordinances were published in November 2020 and became binding on January 1, 2020, with transition periods for certain obligations (such as call filter and roaming obligations). Changes include more extensive consumer and youth protection measures (such as decreasing roaming fees, measures to prevent spoofing). In terms of net neutrality, it foresees more transparency for the customer—the customer must be informed if peer-to-peer traffic is treated unequally and traffic management measures are only allowed under certain very restrictive circumstances (e.g. to fight exceptional network congestion). In addition, customers must be informed about the quality of the internet service (both fixed and mobile internet), and providers must introduce a call filter blocking unlawful calls. New and stronger obligations were also implemented regarding roaming (such as requiring mobile providers to: offer discounted roaming packages with a validity of 12 months, bill roaming charges by the second or per kilobyte and establish maximum spend limits for all roaming services). 
Under the Radio and Television Act and the corresponding ordinance, the Federal Government and the Federal Office of Communications can select up to 25 programs that have to be distributed without the cable operator being entitled to compensation. When a program is not on the mandatory distribution list, network operators must still treat all programs in an equal and non-discriminatory manner.
In September 2016, the Intelligence Agencies Act was approved by the Swiss population and became effective in September 2017. For Telecommunications service providers, the Intelligence Agencies Act set forth new obligations regulating cable traffic. 
In September 2020, the Swiss Parliament adopted a revised version of the Swiss Data Protection Act (DPA), which provides more transparency regarding the processing of data, strengthens the individual’s information rights (e.g. if his/her data is processed in a foreign country) and follows the developments in the E.U., allowing for the continued flow of personal data from the EEA to Switzerland. The corresponding ordinances to the Swiss DPA are expected to be published for the public consultation phase in the spring of 2021.
In terms of 5G expansion developments, the network rollout is significantly hampered at different levels. On a federal level, signature collection is under way for five different people initiatives, all targeting 5G. On the cantonal level, several 
I-29


cantons have suspended permitting of 5G and several cantonal parliaments are requesting a moratoria for 5G and mast citing. On a communal level, several municipalities have stopped antenna permitting and/or issued planning zones, making it impossible to process permits for new antennas as well as minor changes to existing ones.
The Netherlands
Similar to our other operations, the VodafoneZiggo JV is subject to must carry obligations, including a number of regional and local broadcasting channels, as well as public broadcasting channels. 
On August 5, 2013, the Autoriteit Consument & Markt (ACM), the Netherlands NRA, published a market analysis decision on call termination, which combines both the fixed termination market and the mobile termination market. Following various administrative actions, the Dutch Supreme Administrative Court upheld the ACM decision in July 2017. The implementation of the new tariff became effective on July 12, 2017, and will apply until the date that new European tariffs enter into force. 
In July 2015, the Dutch incumbent telecommunications operator KPN filed an appeal against the European Commission regarding its decision to approve the acquisition of Ziggo, which we completed in November 2014. In October 2017, the European General Court ruled that the European Commission did not state sufficient reasons for not analyzing the possible vertical anti-competitive effects on the market for premium pay TV sports channels; thereby annulling the European Commission’s clearance of the Ziggo acquisition. The E.U. Merger Regulation provides in such a case that the transaction be re-examined by the European Commission with a view of adopting a new decision. As a result, we filed a formal re-notification of the Ziggo acquisition with the European Commission. In May 2018, the European Commission again cleared the acquisition. In November 2018, KPN appealed the new European Commission’s clearance of Ziggo/UPC on grounds similar to last time. VodafoneZiggo JV submitted a Statement in Intervention in June 2019. An oral hearing was held on September 15, 2020, and on January 27, 2021 the court rejected KPN’s appeal. 
KPN also filed a court challenge against the European Commission’s 2016 decision that approved the VodafoneZiggo JV transaction. KPN is seeking annulment of the 2016 decision. Oral hearings took place in November 2018.On May 23, 2019, the Court rejected KPN’s appeal. 
On February 27, 2018, the ACM published a draft decision of its analysis of the LLU market, concluding that there is a single market for local and central access. ACM referred to this market as the Wholesale Fixed Access market and concluded that KPN and the VodafoneZiggo JV had joint Significant Market Power. As a result, ACM imposed on the VodafoneZiggo JV an obligation to offer wholesale cable access and continued wholesale cable access regulation of KPN. Following a market consultation, ACM submitted the draft decision to the European Commission. After comments by the European Commission, ACM published the final decision on September 28, 2018, which became effective on October 1, 2018. The VodafoneZiggo JV published a draft Reference Offer on December 31, 2018 and published tariffs on March 31, 2019. In parallel, the VodafoneZiggo JV appealed ACM’s decision before the national court and initiated an action before the European General Court. The national court annulled ACM’s decision and as a result, the VodafoneZiggo JV is no longer obligated to offer cable access. In the action before the European General Court, a decision on the admissibility is expected on February 25, 2021.
On November 9, 2018, the implementation of the NIS Directive by the Netherlands entered into force. In general, providers of electronic communication services are not in scope of the NIS Directive. The legislator for the Netherlands, however, decided to apply, to a certain extent, the NIS Directive on providers of electronic communication services. As a result, the VodafoneZiggo JV must notify the Netherlands Telecoms Agency and the National Cyber Security Center when a cybersecurity incident occurs, as well as the Netherlands Data Protection Authority if a data breach occurs.
