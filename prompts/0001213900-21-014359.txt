Item 1. Business
Introduction
 
We were incorporated as a blank check company on April 7, 2016 in Delaware for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more target businesses (a “Business Combination”).
 
The registration statements for the Company’s initial public offering of securities (the “Initial Public Offering”) were declared effective on July 27, 2017. On August 1, 2017, the Company consummated the Initial Public Offering of 27,000,000 units (“Units” and with respect to the common stock included in the Units, the “Public Shares”) at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $270,000,000.
 
Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the sale of private placement warrants (“Private Placement Warrants”) at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant in a private placement (the “Private Placement”) to the Sponsor, MasTec, Inc. and EarlyBirdCapital, Inc., generating gross proceeds of $9,500,000.
 
Following the closing of the Initial Public Offering on August 1, 2017, an amount of $270,000,000 ($10.00 per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement Warrants was placed in a trust account (the “Trust Account”) and were invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), with a maturity of 180 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by the Company meeting the conditions of paragraphs (d)(2), (d)(3) and (d)(4) of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account, as described below, except that interest earned on the Trust Account can be released to pay the Company’s income tax obligations
 
On August 4, 2017, the underwriters exercised their over-allotment option in full resulting in an additional 4,050,000 Units being issued for $40,500,000, less the underwriters’ discount of $1,012,500, netting $39,487,500, which was deposited into the Trust Account. In connection with the underwriters’ exercise of their over-allotment option in full, the Company also consummated the sale of an additional 1,012,500 Private Placement Warrants at $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating total gross proceeds of $1,012,500, less the advance payment on August 1, 2017 of $600,000 towards this transaction (see Note 5), resulting in another $412,500 being deposited into the Trust Account bringing the balance in the Trust Account on August 4, 2017 to $310,500,000.
 
Transaction costs amounted to $8,646,303, consisting of $7,762,500 of underwriting fees, and $883,803 of other costs. In addition, as of December 31, 2019, $163,211 of cash was held outside of the Trust Account, available for working capital purposes.

The purpose of the Extension is to allow the Company more time to complete a Business Combination. In connection with the Special Meeting and the resulting Charter Amendment, 2,796,290 of the shares of the Company’s Common Stock were redeemed from funds available in the Trust Account, for a redemption amount of approximately $10.18 per share.

Employees
 
As of March 31, 2020, we had three executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters and intend to devote only as much time as they deem necessary to our affairs. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for the business combination and the stage of the business combination process the company is in. Subsequent to the closing of the Business Combination, the Company has seven full-time employees including three executive officers.

We are an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act and will remain such for up to five years. However, if our non-convertible debt issued within a three-year period exceeds $1.0 billion or our total annual revenues exceed $1.07 billion or the market value of our ordinary shares that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million on the last day of the second fiscal quarter of any given fiscal year, we would cease to be an emerging growth company as of the following fiscal year. As an emerging growth company, we have elected, under Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act, to take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards.
