  Development of our Business
  
  HireQuest, Inc. (collectively with its subsidiaries, the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is a Delaware corporation originally organized in Washington as Command Staffing, LLC in 2002. In 2005, Temporary Financial Services, Inc., a public company, acquired the assets of Command Staffing, LLC, and the combined entity changed its name to Command Center, Inc. On September 11, 2019, Command Center, Inc. reincorporated in Delaware and changed its name to Hire Quest, Inc. following its acquisition of Hire Quest Holdings, LLC (“Hire Quest Holdings,” and together with its subsidiary, Hire Quest, LLC, “Legacy HQ”).  This acquisition is sometimes referred to as the “Merger.” Hire Quest, LLC was formed as a Florida limited liability company in 2002. Hire Quest Holdings, LLC was formed as a Florida limited liability company in 2017.

  The Snelling Acquisition
  
  On March 1, 2021, we completed our acquisition of certain assets of Snelling Staffing in accordance with the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement dated January 29, 2021 (the “Snelling Agreement”). Snelling Staffing is a 67-year-old staffing company headquartered in Richardson, TX. Pursuant to the Snelling Agreement, HQ Snelling Corporation (“HQ Snelling”), our wholly-owned subsidiary, acquired approximately 47 offices, substantially all of the operating assets, and assumed certain liabilities of the sellers for a purchase price of $17.3 million, subject to customary adjustments for net working capital plus further adjustment of $7.2 million of collateral released to the sellers by their workers' compensation insurer which Hire Quest, LLC replaced with the insurer (the "Snelling Acquisition"). Also on March 1, 2021, HQ Snelling entered into the First Amendment to the Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which HireQuest, Inc. agreed to advance $2.1 million to be paid to the sellers at closing to be used to pay accrued payroll liabilities that HQ Snelling assumed pursuant to the Snelling Agreement. We funded this acquisition with existing cash on hand and a draw on our existing line of credit with Truist Bank, formerly Branch Banking and Trust Company ("Truist").
 The Link Acquisition
  
 
 On March 22, 2021, we completed our acquisition of the franchise relationships and certain other assets of Link Staffing in accordance with the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement dated February 12, 2021 (the "Link Agreement"). Link Staffing is a family-owned staffing company headquartered in Houston, TX. Pursuant to the Link Agreement, HQ Link Corporation ("HQ Link"), our wholly-owned subsidiary, acquired approximately 35 franchised offices, customer lists and contracts, and other assets of Link Staffing for a purchase price of $11.1 million (the "Link Acquisition"). We funded this acquisition with existing cash on hand. We did not receive working capital and expect to satisfy future working capital needs related to the Link Acquisition with existing cash on hand and a line of credit with Truist.
  
 
 Together, the Snelling Acquisition and the Link Acquisition are sometimes referred to herein as the "March 2021 Acquisitions."
  
  The Command Center Merger, the Name Change, and the Reincorporation in Delaware
  
  On July 15, 2019, Legacy HQ and Command Center completed the Merger.
  
  Upon closing, the ownership interests of Hire Quest Holdings were converted into the right to receive a number of shares amounting to 68% of the total shares of the Company’s common stock outstanding immediately after the closing. Legacy HQ members also appointed four new directors to the Board effective July 15, 2019 to fill the board seats vacated by four legacy Command Center directors.
  
  On September 11, 2019, Command Center changed its name to HireQuest, Inc. We reincorporated in Delaware, consolidated our corporate headquarters in Goose Creek, South Carolina, and adopted new bylaws. In connection with the name change, we started trading as “HQI” on the Nasdaq Capital Market.

  Franchise Model Conversion
  
  On July 15, 2019, we sold the operating assets of the offices in Conway and North Little Rock, AR; Flagstaff, Mesa, North Phoenix, Phoenix, Tempe, Tucson, and Yuma, AZ; Aurora and Thornton, CO; Atlanta, GA; College Park and Speedway, IN; Shreveport, LA; Baltimore and Landover, MD; Oklahoma City and Tulsa, OK; Chattanooga, Madison, Memphis, and Nashville, TN; Amarillo, Austin, Houston, Irving, Lubbock, Odessa, and San Antonio, TX; and Roanoke, VA to existing franchisees of Legacy HQ (including the Worlds Franchisees described below) and new franchisees. On September 29, 2019, we sold the operating assets of the offices in Coeur D’Alene, ID; Griffith, IN; Bloomington, Brooklyn Park, Cambridge, Hopkins, St. Paul, and Wilmar, MN; Bismarck, Dickinson, Fargo, Grand Forks, Minot, Watford City, and Williston, ND; Bellevue and Omaha, NE; Hillsboro, OR; Sioux Falls, SD; and Bellingham, Everett, Kent, Mt. Vernon, Seattle, Spokane, Tacoma, and Vancouver, WA to a new franchisee. The purchasers of these assets, or their related entities, executed franchise agreements with us and became franchisees.
  
  The aggregate sale price for the operating assets of the offices sold on July 15 and September 29, 2019 consisted of approximately (i) $12.1 million paid in the form of promissory notes accruing interest at an annual rate of 6% plus (ii) the right to receive 2% of annual sales in excess of $3.2 million in the aggregate for the franchise territory containing Phoenix, AZ for 10 years, up to a total aggregate amount of $2.0 million. Approximately $2.2 million of the notes receivable were sold to Hire Quest Financial, LLC, a related party, in exchange for accounts receivable of an equal value. In addition, we received $3.0 million in cash as prepayment on the notes issued on September 29, 2019. In accordance with an agreement with the buyer, an unrelated franchisee, this cash payment also triggered a discount in the purchase price equal to 10% of the cash payment, or $300,000.
  
  We have recognized the operations of company-owned offices within discontinued operations. Any additional expenses incurred related to previously company-owned offices will continue to be recognized as part of discontinued operations in future periods. This conversion of company-owned offices to franchises will likely have a material impact on the presentation of our results of operations in the future with revenue from franchise royalty fees and service revenue increasing and income from discontinued operations, net of tax decreasing to zero by the end of the first quarter of 2020.
  
  Our Model
  
  We are a nationwide franchisor of temporary staffing offices providing on-demand labor solutions primarily in the light industrial and blue-collar segments of the staffing industry. Following the March 2021 Acquisitions, we expect to have a significant presence in more traditional commercial staffing. We provide our customers with seamless access to a contingent workforce whenever they need it. Our daily dispatch model, in which we match temporary employees with openings every day, allows us to be responsive to our customers’ dynamic needs. Our flexible staffing solutions permit our customers to focus on their underlying operations and to expand or contract their workforce quickly to meet fluctuating demands. We pay the majority of our temporary employees daily which attracts workers who cannot wait up to three weeks for their first paycheck under a traditional model.
   
  In 2020, our franchisees operated through one of our two owned brands: HireQuest Direct and HireQuest. HireQuest Direct, which has historically representsed the great majority of our franchises, focuses on daily-work daily-pay jobs in the construction and light industrial segments. HireQuest focuses on longer-term staffing positions in the light industrial and administrative arenas. Following the March 2021 Acquisitions, we also own and offer the Snelling brand in the longer-term commercial arena. We will also license the Link brand to some of the franchisees we acquired in the Link Acquisition.
  
  Our revenue, which is largely comprised of royalty fees and interest charged to our franchisees on overdue accounts receivable, was $13.8 million in 2020. Our system-wide sales, which we define as sales at all office locations, whether owned and operated by us or by our franchisees, were $210.9 million in 2020, all of which was attributable to franchisee-owned locations. We employed approximately 57,000 temporary employees in 2020. At December 31, 2020, we had 139 franchisee-owned offices operating in 30 states and the District of Columbia. On a net basis, we closed 8 offices in 2020 (opening 5 and closing 13), with most of the closures directly related to the COVID-19 pandemic. These closures, however, were in markets where we maintain a presence or which historically produced small amounts of system-wide sales.
  
  We provide incentives to our existing franchisees, including assistance with start-up funding and acquisition costs, to encourage them to open in new markets. While staffing industry growth has outpaced overall economic and employment growth, the industry still employs only 2% of the United States’ non-farm workforce.1 We believe that the low percentage of the total workforce that is currently contingent, when combined with potential shifts towards a more contingent workforce in the overall economy, provides an opportunity for future organic growth.

  Our differentiated services are driven by two key elements:
  
   ●
 Local ownership and dedicated responsiveness. Our offices are franchisee-owned. We believe that ownership at the local level, where the vast majority of customer interaction occurs, allows our organization to be agile and responsive to customer needs. Since our franchisees have a personal financial interest in the success of their offices, our customers interact with a representative who is incentivized to deliver excellent customer service and resolve issues efficiently. We believe the combination of local ownership coupled with properly-aligned incentives results in enhanced customer satisfaction and greater customer retention.

 
   ●
 Direct dispatch from our offices. The majority of our employees in our construction and light industrial segment are dispatched from our offices every day. This allows our franchisees and their staff to qualify the employees for work, provide them with any necessary personal protective equipment, assist them in arranging transportation amongst themselves, and ensure the right number of qualified individuals are dispatched at the right time. We believe that employee dispatch from franchise offices increases consistency as our employees are sent to a particular jobsite without having to rely on potentially less reliable means of verification, such as telephone calls. Once we and our customers have developed a rapport with particular employees, we will sometimes dispatch these employees directly to a customer location.

 
  Our Industry
  
  Temporary Staffing
  
  According to the American Staffing Association, the staffing and recruiting industry employed approximately 15 million people and accounted for $161 billion of sales in 2019.2 We have historically focused primarily on the largest segment, light industrial and blue collar work, which accounts for roughly 36% of the temporary staffing industry.3 Following the March 2021 Acquisitions, we expect to expand more significantly into several of the remaining segments of the staffing industry including clerical and administrative, professional, and health care.
 
 
  The on-demand labor industry has developed based on business needs for flexible staffing solutions. The industry provides contingent workforce solutions as an alternative to the costs and efforts that are required for recruiting, hiring and managing permanent employees. Many of the customers we target operate in a cyclical production environment and find it difficult to staff according to their changing business requirements. Companies also desire a way to maintain consistent staffing levels when full-time employees are absent due to illness, vacation, or unplanned terminations. On-demand labor offers customers the opportunity to respond immediately to changes in staffing needs, to reduce the costs associated with recruiting and interviewing, to eliminate unemployment and workers’ compensation exposure, and to draw from a larger pool of potential employees. We have found that staffing firms provide particular value in assisting customers with filling mundane or repetitive jobs, high turnover positions, staffing for project specific needs, and filling other short duration positions such as special events, disaster recovery, and seasonal jobs.

  Historically, our business has been bolstered by declining unemployment rates as our customers find it more difficult and more expensive to recruit, interview, hire, and train qualified staff. As employers look for alternatives to combat these increasing costs and administrative burdens, opportunities arise for the temporary staffing industry. In addition, worker attitudes have changed from one which idealized extended tenure with a single employer to one which is more open to temporary or transient employment. This shift has increased the availability of temporary workers in the economy as a whole. Alternately, periods of declining unemployment are a headwind for our business.
 Government Regulation
  
  While the offices under our brands are operated by franchisees, our wholly-owned subsidiary is the employer of record of the temporary employees. As a large employer, we are subject to a significant number of employment laws at the state, federal, and local levels. We are required to comply with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations relating to employment, including verification of eligibility for employment, occupational safety and health provisions, wage and hour requirements, employment insurance, and laws relating to equal opportunity employment. In addition to federal and state laws and regulations, many counties and cities have become active in regulating various aspects of employment, including minimum wages, paid sick leave, retirement savings programs, transportation benefits, application forms and background checks, and required notices to employees, among others.
  
  In addition, fourteen states and the Federal Trade Commission impose pre-sale franchise registration or disclosure requirements on franchisors. A number of states also regulate substantive aspects of our relationship with our franchisees such as termination, nonrenewal, transfer, no-poach and non-competition provisions, discrimination among franchisees, and other aspects of the relationships between and with franchisees. Additional legislation, which we cannot predict, could expand these requirements imposed on us.
  
  Our Competitive Strengths
  
  We attribute our success to the following strengths:
  
   ●
 Nationwide footprint with differentiated business model. We believe we are one of the largest providers of on-demand temporary staffing solutions in the light industrial and blue-collar segments of the staffing industry measured by number of office locations. Our nationwide footprint allows us to compete for national account relationships not available to many of our local or regional competitors. Our size also allows us to obtain favorable terms on our workers’ compensation insurance program. Our franchise model has many advantages as well. Most of our competitors utilize a company-owned office model in which management of day-to-day interactions with customers is handled by individuals who do not have the same incentive to succeed as franchisees have as owners of their businesses. The company-owned model typically requires significant investment in middle management to overcome this lack of incentive. We largely avoid this expense because our franchisees are independent business owners responsible for their own financial well-being, and in doing so increase our store level economics.

 
   ●
 A franchise system with expansion capabilities. We incentivize our franchisees to expand their own businesses through our Franchise Expansion Incentive Program. Under this program, we offer assistance overcoming the startup costs of an office in a new metropolitan area by providing our existing franchisees with credits on the royalty fees they pay in their existing offices. In addition, under certain circumstances, we will provide assistance in acquisition funding or financing. We also maintain a Risk Management Incentive Program which allows us to reward franchisees who are successful in keeping their workers' compensation loss ratios below certain thresholds by paying to franchisees an amount equivalent to a portion of their premiums. We believe that this incentivizes our franchisees to encourage workplace safety, while also providing franchisees with capital to reinvest in, or expand, their businesses.

   ●
 Responsible capital allocation with very little debt. As of December 31, 2020, we remain debt free. Financing our day-to-day needs with cash produced from operations allows us to continue building cash reserves which we can use, in addition to our line of credit with Truist, to finance significant transactions such as major reinvestments in our business, strategic acquisitions, share buybacks, or stockholder dividends, depending on the opportunities that present themselves. Compared to company-owned offices, our franchise model allows us to employ relatively fewer full-time staff at our corporate headquarters decreasing the working capital needed for operations.

 
  Our Growth Strategy
  
  We believe there are opportunities to grow our business and brand. While the onset of COVID-19 has made the economic future unpredictable, we believe the following to be key components of our growth strategy:
  
   ●
 Make strategic acquisitions. We are continuously evaluating acquisition opportunities that will allow us to expand our franchisee base and diversify our national footprint.

 
   ●
 Continue to grow the number of offices our franchisees operate. We believe attractive returns at the franchisee level positions us to continue to attract new franchisees and encourage our existing franchisees to open new offices. In addition, we encourage our existing franchisees to explore new potential markets through our Franchise Expansion Incentive Program. When combined with the back-office support that we provide franchisees, we believe we are poised to expand into unserved or underserved markets like the Upper Midwestern United States.

 
   ●
 Capitalize on our national footprint to grow same store and system-wide sales. We anticipate that our enhanced scale combined with our royalty-driven business model will contribute to growth in our access to and profitability from national accounts. Traditionally, these larger national accounts have the leverage to impose lower margins on their temporary staffing providers. Our royalty-driven business model, in which we earn a percentage of gross billings or funded payroll regardless of margins, partially insulates stockholders from short-term margin volatility inherent in the ownership of the traditional company-owned model for temporary staffing.

 
   ●
 Increase our brand awareness. As we continue to develop new markets and to serve our existing markets, we expect our brand to become more recognizable and a greater asset to us in driving repeat customers, encouraging customers to expand their use of our services across multiple markets, and increasing new customer development.

  Our Offices
  
  We had 139 offices located in 30 states and the District of Columbia as of December 31, 2020. All were franchised. The map below provides the number of offices we had in each state.
 Number of Offices By State
   December 31, 2020
  
 
  We have a strong concentration of offices in established and emerging regions such as the Southeast, Texas, Colorado, and Washington. These regional office concentrations contribute to greater brand recognition while we continue to add offices in unserved and underserved regions. These concentrations also allow us to better recognize local and regional market trends. We encourage our franchisees to locate in areas with access to public transportation and major thoroughfares. Locations with these characteristics make it easier for our employee base to reach our office, which improves their ability to efficiently get to their work assignments. Most of our franchisee offices are located near areas of concentrated construction or major manufacturing and industrial sites.
 Our Franchise Program
  
  Our franchised offices are a key component of our success. We urge our franchisees to customize their services according to the unique opportunities and assets presented at each of their offices, while also leveraging the overall size of the organization whenever possible. This approach allows for each office to have a unique blend of customers and emphasis while also reducing overhead costs, improving economies of scale, establishing procedural uniformity and controls, and creating a predictable internal environment for temporary employees.
  
  A typical franchised office location is managed by an owner with the assistance of in-office personnel. Many offices hire business development staff to help drive business to the offices. We provide advice and guidance from our corporate headquarters.
  
  Franchising Strategy
  
  As of December 31, 2020, there were 139 franchised HireQuest and HireQuest Direct offices operated by 59 franchisees. Approximately one-third of our franchisees owned multiple offices. Our largest franchisee owned 12 offices, and about one-sixth of our franchisees owned 4 or more offices. One individual owned significant interests in 6 franchisees that operated 35 offices. We also had 21 franchisees that share common ownership with significant stockholders, directors, and officers of the Company, which we refer to as Worlds Franchisees. The Worlds Franchisees operated 49 offices as of December 31, 2020.

  Our approach to the franchise model creates what we believe to be superior office-level economics. We finance many of the initial working capital needs of our franchisees, including costs of new office openings, through our ownership of franchisee accounts receivable which we acquire through our franchise agreements. This is a relatively inexpensive source of capital for our franchisees and allows them to expand more freely. In addition, our Risk Management Incentive Program lowers the effective cost of workers’ compensation insurance at the franchisee level – a significant expense for many of our competitors. Through our Risk Management Incentive Program, we pay franchisees who keep their workers’ compensation loss ratios below a specific loss threshold an amount equivalent to a portion of the premium they pay for workers’ compensation coverage. We thereby eliminate for our franchisees two of the strongest barriers to entry: financing and workers’ compensation, and enable potentially higher operating margins at the office level.
  
  Franchise Agreements
  
Our franchise agreement contain standard terms and conditions. In most cases, our franchisees are granted the exclusive right to operate their chosen brand, either HireQuest or HireQuest Direct, in their protected territory. Typically, a protected territory corresponds with the metropolitan statistical area where the office is located.
  
  As of December 31, 2020, our franchisees operated under 88 executed franchise agreements. For our HireQuest Direct business line we charge a royalty fee of between 6% and 8% of gross sales, depending on sales volume. For our HireQuest business line, we charge a royalty fee of 4.5% of the payroll we fund plus 18% of the gross margin for the territory.
  
  Our typical franchise agreement has a term of five years. Our franchise agreement is designed to remove some of the most significant barriers to entry in our industry – access to working capital, and dedicated software. By entering into a franchisee agreement with us, our franchisees gain access to our proprietary software, HQ WebConnect, which we update regularly through a dedicated staff of developers, and gain access to working capital by factoring their accounts receivable through us. Additionally, in states that do not require participation in a state-run program, our franchisees gain access to our workers’ compensation insurance coverage.
  
  Franchisees receive initial and ongoing training in our methods of operation. We provide support personnel on an as-needed basis to our franchisees. We have a comprehensive brand standards manual which explains our policies on key operational, financial, and regulatory compliance issues. Under the franchise agreement, beneficial owners of our franchisees guaranty all debts and obligations of the franchise to us. Still, we have less control over a franchisee’s operations than we would if we owned and operated an office ourselves.
  
  The table below displays the number of franchise agreements scheduled to renew at the end of each year:
  
 
Year | Renewals
-----+---------
2021 | 9 
2022 | 13 
2023 | 12 
2024 | 42 
2025 | 6 
2029 | 6 


 
  The large number of renewals in 2024 arose because of the significant number of new franchisees we added in 2019 as a result of the Merger. The table above does not include franchisees acquired through the March 2021 Acquisitions.
  
  Our Human Capital Resources
  
  Temporary Employees
  
  Our temporary employees are a key component of our success. We consider them one of our most valuable assets as they perform the services we provide. Hire Quest, LLC, our wholly-owned subsidiary, is the employer of record of all of our temporary employees. In 2020, we employed approximately 57,000 temporary employees and issued approximately 1.1 million paychecks. The vast majority of these payments were made via electronic paycard. Given the nature of temporary employment, it is difficult for us to determine the exact number of full time employees on a given day, however, approximately 660 temporary employees worked at least 1,800 hours in 2020.
  
 
   
10


  
 

 
  These temporary employees served thousands of customers, primarily in the construction, industrial/manufacturing, warehousing, hospitality, recycling/waste management, and disaster recovery industries. Our customers range in size from small, local businesses to large, multi-national corporations. Most of our work assignments are short-term, and many are filled with little advance notice from customers.
  
  We continuously recruit temporary staff so we can respond to customer needs quickly. We attract our employees through various means, including in-person recruitment, online resources, cell phone texting services, our large and ever-growing internal database, job fairs, word-of-mouth, advertisements, and a number of other methods. Our success is dependent, in part, on our ability to attract and retain temporary employees. To that end, we have implemented a robust health insurance program giving qualifying temporary employees a list of plans to choose from.
  
  The safety of our temporary employees remains one of our highest priorities. We regularly provide safety and skills training. We also aggressively manage our workers' compensation program to identify trends in injuries and limit our losses and exposure. Through our Risk Management Incentive Program, our franchisees are incentivized to ensure safe working environments and to achieve quick resolutions of workers' compensation claims when they do arise.
  
  Corporate Employees
  
  We believe our success depends on our ability to attract, develop and retain talented employees. The skills, experience and industry knowledge of our employees significantly benefit our operations and performance. We believe a strong, positive corporate culture and employee engagement is key to attracting and retaining talented employees. Executives of the company set this tone at the top and we routinely have Company functions designed to engage and integrate our employees into our culture. We employ approximately forty corporate employees through HQ LTS Corporation, our wholly-owned subsidiary. Most of these individuals are employed at our corporate headquarters in Goose Creek, South Carolina. The vast majority of these employees are full-time. These employees provide back office support, including financing, insurance, accounting, operations, national sales, information technology, legal, and human resources services to our franchisees and temporary employees.

  Our Competition
  
  The manual labor sector of the on-demand labor industry is largely fragmented and highly competitive, with relatively low barriers to entry aside from payroll funding, workers’ compensation premiums, and startup costs. No single staffing company dominates the industry. Our competitors range in size from small, local or regional operators with five or fewer locations to large, multi-national companies with hundreds of locations. Our strongest competition in any market comes from companies that have established long-lasting relationships with their clients. Competition in the industry tends to track the overall strength of the economy and trends in workforce flexibility. As the economy grows, the number of competitors generally increases.
  
  The primary competitive factors in our market segments include price, the ability to provide the requested workers on a timely basis, and success in meeting customer expectations. Secondary factors include customer relationships, name recognition, and established reputation. Businesses operating in these segments of the on-demand labor industry require access to significant working capital to pay temporary employees, particularly in the spring and summer when seasonal staffing requirements are highest, and to fund workers' compensation premiums and claims. Lack of working capital can be a significant impediment to growth for small, local, and regional on-demand labor providers. A second barrier to entry is an affordable workers’ compensation policy. Small entrants usually do not have the scale necessary to secure a policy on terms similar to ours. Regulatory compliance is becoming more burdensome, particularly for smaller firms that cannot profitably comply with the increasing number of federal, state, and local employment laws and regulations.
  
  We also face increasing competition from gig-economy companies who are attempting to monetize the temporary staffing industry through smartphone applications. We believe these apps, however, will not be a major source of successful competition in the commoditized section of the labor markets where we operate. The apps, which operate on a broad-blast, first-come-first-served basis, often result in too many or too few workers arriving at a jobsite, workers arriving without the necessary required personal protective equipment, or employees arriving at a jobsite unwilling or unable to perform the assigned tasks. In contrast, our direct dispatch model allows us to screen employees’ readiness for work every day, assist with arranging transportation to and from jobsites, and match employees with company-provided personal protective equipment before they leave the office.
  
  Our Cyclicality and Seasonality
  
  The temporary staffing industry has historically been cyclical. Success tends to track the economy. When our franchisees’ customers expect to have long-term permanent needs, they tend to increase their use of temporary employees. Our revenue tends to increase as the economy expands, and conversely, our revenue tends to decrease when the economy contracts.
  
  Some of the industries in which we operate are subject to seasonal fluctuation. Many of the jobs filled by temporary employees are outdoors and generally performed during the warmer months of the year. As a result, activity increases in the spring and continues at higher levels through the summer, then begins to taper off during fall and through winter. In addition, demand by industrial customers tends to slow after the holiday season and pick up again in the third and fourth quarters – peaking in the third quarter. Our exposure to seasonality is mitigated, in part, by our strong presence in the Southern United States where seasonal fluctuations are typically less pronounced.

  We own the rights to all of our key trademarks including “HireQuest,” “HireQuest Direct,” “The Right People at the Right Time,” and all of our stylized logos. We also own the rights to trademarks we have utilized in the past. We license the use of our marks to our franchisees via the franchise agreements. Following the March 2021 Acquisitions, we also own the Snelling-related trademarks and have a license to use the Link-associated trademarks with franchisees acquired in the Link Acquisition.
  
  We have developed and own our proprietary software to handle most aspects of operations, including temporary employee dispatch and payroll, invoicing, and accounts receivable. Our software system also allows us to produce internal reports necessary to track and manage financial performance of franchisees, customer trends, detect potential fraud, and to examine other key performance indicators. We believe that our software facilitates efficient customer interaction, allowing for online bill payment, invoice review, and other important functions. Because WebConnect is a proprietary system, we maintain a dedicated IT development staff, who continually refine our software in response to feedback from franchisees, customers, and employees. We license the use of our software to franchisees via our franchise agreements. The system is not patented. We have invested in off-site back-up and storage systems that we believe provide reasonable protections for our electronic information systems against breakdowns as well as other disruptions and unauthorized intrusions.
  
  We rely on common law protection of our copyrighted works. These works include advertising and marketing materials and other items that are not material to our business. We license some intellectual property from third parties for use in our corporate headquarters, but such licenses are not material to our business.
