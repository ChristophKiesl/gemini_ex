 Description of Business 
 We are one of the leaders in the motion picture exhibition industry. As of December 31, 2016, we operated 526 theatres and 5,903 screens in the U.S. and Latin America and approximately 287 million guests attended our theatres worldwide during the year ended December 31, 2016. We are one of the most geographically diverse worldwide exhibitors, with theatres in sixteen countries as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, our U.S. circuit had 339 theatres and 4,559 screens in 41 states and our international circuit had 187 theatres and 1,344 screens in 15 countries. 
 Revenues, operating income and net income attributable to Cinemark Holdings, Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2016, were $2,918.8 million, $422.9 million and $255.1 million, respectively. At December 31, 2016 we had cash and cash equivalents of $561.2 million and total long-term debt of $1,823.0 million. Approximately $663.8 million, or 36%, of our long-term debt accrues interest at variable rates and $5.7 million of our long-term debt matures in 2017. 
 We selectively build or acquire new theatres in markets where we can establish and maintain a strong market position. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we built 18 new theatres with 144 screens and acquired four theatres with 52 screens. 
 Our significant and diverse presence in the U.S. and Latin America has made us an important distribution channel for movie studios, particularly considering the expanding worldwide box office. We believe our portfolio of modern, high-quality theatres with multiple platforms provides a preferred destination for moviegoers and contributes to our solid and consistent cash flows from operating activities. We continue to develop and expand new platforms and market adaptive concepts for our theatre circuit, such as XD, Luxury Lounger recliner seats, Cinemark Reserve, enhanced food and beverage, motion seats, CinèArts and other premium concepts. 
 Our XD screens represent the largest private label premium large format footprint in the industry. Our XD auditoriums offer a premium experience utilizing the latest in digital projection and enhanced custom sound, including a Barco Auro 11.1 sound system or Dolby Atmos in select locations. The XD experience includes wall-to-wall screens, wrap-around sound, plush seating and a maximum comfort entertainment environment for an immersive experience. The exceptional XD technology does not require special format movie prints, which 
 
2 
 
 allows us the flexibility to play any available digital print we choose, including 3-D content, in our XD auditoriums. As of December 31, 2016, we had 225 XD auditoriums in our worldwide circuit with plans to install 10 to 15 more XD auditoriums during 2017. 
 We have incorporated Luxury Lounger recliner seats in the majority of our domestic new builds and have also repositioned many of our existing domestic theatres to offer this premium seating feature. We currently feature Luxury Loungers in 1,028 of our domestic auditoriums. We plan to continue to add additional Luxury Loungers in certain of our domestic locations during 2017. 
 We opened our first Cinemark Reserve concept in the U.S. during 2014, which features a VIP area with luxury recliner seating and other amenities along with a wide variety of food and beverage products. We offer this concept in seven domestic locations and in 23 of our international theatres, referred to locally as either Cinemark Premiere or Cinemark Prime. We plan to continue to incorporate this concept in four of our new domestic and international theatres and convert five of our existing locations during 2017. 
 We offer enhanced food and beverages such as fresh wraps, hot sandwiches, burgers, and gourmet pizzas, and a selection of beers, wines, and frozen cocktails, all of which can be enjoyed in the comfort of the auditoriums, at approximately 41% of our worldwide theatres. 
 We currently have auditoriums throughout our worldwide circuit that offer seats with immersive cinematic motion, which we refer to as motion seats. These motion seats are programmed in harmony with the audio and video content of the film and make the viewers feel as if they are part of the movie itself. We offer motion seats in 152 auditoriums throughout our worldwide circuit. We plan to add motion seats to 35 additional locations during 2017. 
 Our CinèArts locations provide moviegoers with the best selection of art and independent cinema in a captivating, unique environment and have set the industry standard for providing distinct, acclaimed and award-winning films. We currently have 14 domestic theatres that are dedicated to art and independent content and 58 of our other domestic theatres also offer art and independent films on a limited basis. 
 Motion Picture Exhibition Industry Overview 
 Technology Platform 
 The U.S. motion picture exhibition industry completed its conversion to digital projection technology during 2013. Currently, all of our domestic and first-run international theatres are fully digital. Digital projection technology allows filmmakers the ability to showcase imaginative works of art exactly as they were intended, with incredible realism and detail. A digitally produced or digitally converted movie can be distributed to theatres via satellite, physical media, or fiber optic networks. The digitized movie is stored on a computer/server which serves it to a digital projector for each screening of the movie. This format enables us to more efficiently move titles between auditoriums within a theatre to appropriately address demand for each title in real-time. 
 Digital projection also allows us to present 3-D content and alternative entertainment such as live and pre-recorded sports programs, concert events, the Metropolitan Opera, e-sports and gaming events and other special presentations. Three-dimensional technology offers a premium experience with crisp, bright, ultra-realistic images. According to Motion Picture Association of America, or MPAA, approximately 14% and 15% of domestic box office for 2014 and 2015, respectively, was generated by 3-D tickets. 
 All of our domestic locations can receive movie and movie-related content via satellite through the content delivery network of Digital Cinema Distribution Coalition, or DCDC, the motion picture exhibition industry joint venture established during 2013. Approximately 75% of our domestic locations can also receive live content via satellite. Delivery of content via satellite reduces film transportation costs for both distributors and exhibitors, as a portion of the costs to produce and ship hard drives has been eliminated. 
 
3 
 
During 2015, we began the expansion of satellite delivery technology into our Latin American markets, initially for live event presentations. Seventy-four of our international theatres have the capability to receive live event feeds via satellite, with some of these locations also able to receive film content via satellite. We expect that all of our international locations will have this capability by the end of 2017. 
 Domestic Markets 
 The U.S. motion picture exhibition industry set an all-time box office record during 2015 with $11.1 billion in revenues and preliminary 2016 box office estimates indicate a new record has been set at approximately $11.3 billion, a 2% increase. The following table represents the results of a survey by MPAA published during March 2016, outlining the historical trends in U.S. box office performance for the ten year period from 2006 to 2015 (industry data for 2016 has not yet been released): 

Year | U.S. Box Office Revenues ($ in billions) | Attendance (in billions) | Average Ticket Price
2006 | $9.2 | 1.40 | $6.55 
2007 | $9.6 | 1.40 | $6.88 
2008 | $9.6 | 1.34 | $7.18 
2009 | $10.6 | 1.42 | $7.50 
2010 | $10.6 | 1.34 | $7.89 
2011 | $10.2 | 1.28 | $7.93 
2012 | $10.8 | 1.36 | $7.96 
2013 | $10.9 | 1.34 | $8.13 
2014 | $10.4 | 1.27 | $8.17 
2015 | $11.1 | 1.32 | $8.43 

 Films leading the box office during the year ended December 31, 2016 included the carryover of the December 2015 release of Star Wars: The Force Awakens and the 2016 releases of Finding Dory, Captain America: Civil War, The Secret Life Of Pets, The Jungle Book, Deadpool, Zootopia, Batman V Superman: Dawn Of Justice, Suicide Squad, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, Moana, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story and Sing, among other films. 
 Films scheduled for release during 2017 include well-known franchise films such as Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Beauty and the Beast, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, Justice League, Spider Man: Homecoming, Despicable Me 3, Thor: Ragnarok, The Fate of the Furious, Wonder Woman, and The Lego Batman Movie, among other films. 
International Markets 
 According to MPAA, international box office revenues were $27.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, representing a 4% increase over 2014. According to MPAA, Latin American box office revenues were $3.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of 13% over 2014. (Industry data for 2016 has not yet been released.) 
 Growth in Latin America continues to be fueled by a combination of growing populations, attractive demographics (i.e., a significant teenage population), continued retail development in select markets, and quality product from Hollywood, including 3-D and alternative content offerings. In many Latin American countries, including Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Peru and Chile, successful local film product can also provide incremental box office growth opportunities. 
 We believe many international markets will continue to experience growth as new theatre technologies and platforms are introduced, as film and other product offerings continue to expand and as ancillary revenue 
 
4 
 
 opportunities grow. We also believe some of these markets are underscreened in comparison to the U.S. and European markets. 
 Drivers of Continued Industry Success 
 We believe the following market trends will drive the continued strength of our industry: 
 Importance of Theatrical Success in Establishing Movie Brands. Theatrical exhibition has long been the primary distribution channel for new motion picture releases. A successful theatrical release brands a film and is one of the major contributors to a films success in downstream markets, such as digital downloads, video on-demand, pay-per-view television, DVDs, and network and syndicated television. 
 Increased Importance of International Markets for Box Office Success. International markets continue to be an increasingly important component of the overall box office revenues generated by Hollywood films, accounting for $27.2 billion, or approximately 71%, of 2015 total worldwide box office revenues according to MPAA. (As of the date of this report, 2016 industry data was not yet available.) With the continued growth of the international motion picture exhibition industry, we believe the relative contribution of markets outside North America will continue to increase. Many of the top U.S. films released during 2016 also performed exceptionally well in international markets. Such films included Star Wars: The Force Awakens, which grossed approximately $1.1 billion in international markets, or approximately 54% of its worldwide box office, Captain America: Civil War, which grossed approximately $745.1 million in international markets, or approximately 65% of its worldwide box office, and Zootopia, which grossed approximately $682.5 million in international markets, or approximately 67% of its worldwide box office. 
 Stable Box Office Levels. Over the past ten years, industry statistics have shown slight increases and decreases in attendance from one year to another, however domestic box office revenues have remained relatively stable during this period. The industry has not experienced highly volatile results, even during recessionary periods, demonstrating the stability of the industry, its continued ability to attract consumers and the fact that box office performance is dependent on film product rather than economic cycles. 
 Convenient and Affordable Form of Out-Of-Home Entertainment. Movie going continues to be one of the most convenient and affordable forms of out-of-home entertainment, with an estimated average ticket price in the U.S. of $8.43 in 2015. Average prices in 2015 for other forms of out-of-home entertainment in the U.S., including sporting events and theme parks, ranged from approximately $28.00 to $85.00 per ticket according to MPAA. (As of the date of this report, 2016 industry data was not available.) 
 Innovation Using Satellite Technology. Our industry began the development of a content delivery network in domestic markets during 2013 and international markets during 2014. Satellite delivery allows exhibitors to expand their product offerings, including the presentation of 3-D content and alternative entertainment. Alternative entertainment may include pre-recorded programs as well as live sports programs, concert events, the Metropolitan Opera, e-sports gaming events and other special presentations. New and enhanced programming alternatives expand the industrys offerings to attract a broader customer base. 
 Introduction of New Platforms and Product Offerings. The motion picture exhibition industry continues to develop new movie theatre platforms and concepts to respond to varying and changing consumer preferences. In addition to changing the overall style of, and amenities offered in, some theatres concession product offerings have continued to expand to more than just traditional popcorn and candy items. Some locations now offer hot foods, alcohol offerings and/or healthier snack options for guests.

Competitive Strengths 
 We believe the following strengths allow us to compete effectively: 
 Experienced Management. Led by Chairman and founder Lee Roy Mitchell, Chief Executive Officer Mark Zoradi, Chief Financial Officer Sean Gamble, and President-International Valmir Fernandes, our operational management team has many years of industry experience. Each of our international offices is led by general managers that are local citizens familiar with cultural, political and economic factors impacting each country. Our worldwide management team has successfully navigated us through many industry and economic cycles. 
 Disciplined Operating Philosophy. We generated operating income and net income attributable to Cinemark Holdings, Inc. of $422.9 million and $255.1 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016. Our solid operating performance is a result of our disciplined operating philosophy that centers on building, and reinvesting in, high-quality theatres, while maintaining favorable theatre-level economics, controlling operating costs and effectively reacting to economic and market changes. 
 Leading Position in Our U.S. Markets. We have a leading market share in most of the U.S. markets we serve, which includes a presence in 41 states. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we ranked either first or second, based on box office revenues, in 24 out of our top 30 U.S. markets, including the San Francisco Bay Area, Dallas, Houston, Salt Lake City, Sacramento, Cleveland and Austin. 
 Located in Top Latin American Markets. We have successfully established a significant presence in major cities in the region, with theatres in thirteen of the fifteen largest metropolitan areas in South America. As of December 31, 2016, we operated 187 theatres and 1,344 screens in 15 countries. Our international screens generated revenues of $701.6 million, or 24% of our total revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2016. We are the largest exhibitor in Brazil and Argentina and have significant market presence in Colombia and Chile. Our geographic diversity makes us an important distribution channel for the movie studios. 
 State-of-the-Art Theatre Circuit. We offer a state-of-the-art movie-going experience, which we believe makes our theatres a preferred destination for moviegoers in our markets. During 2016, we built 144 new screens worldwide. We currently have commitments to open 152 additional new screens over the next three years. We have installed digital projection technology in all of our worldwide auditoriums. Currently, approximately 55% of our U.S. screens and 66% of our international screens are 3-D compatible. We currently have 15 digital IMAX screens. As of December 31, 2016, we had the industry-leading private label premium large format circuit with 225 XD auditoriums in our theatres. We have plans to install 10 to 15 additional XD auditoriums during 2017. We also continue to develop new market-adaptive theatre concepts in various markets. We believe we offer the brightest picture in the industry, with our Doremi servers and Barco digital projectors, and custom surround sound in our auditoriums. We have also established a centralized theatre support center that monitors and responds to projection performance and theatre network connectivity issues across our worldwide circuit on a real-time basis. 
 Disciplined and Targeted Growth Strategy. We continue to grow organically as well as through the acquisition of high-quality theatres in select markets. Our growth strategy has centered around exceeding our return on investment thresholds while also complementing our existing theatre circuit. We continue to generate significant cash flows from operating activities, which demonstrates the success of our growth strategy. We believe a combination of our strong balance sheet and our expected level of cash flows will continue to provide us with the financial flexibility to pursue further growth opportunities, while also allowing us to effectively service our debt obligations and continue to offer our stockholders a strong dividend yield.

Our Strategy 
 We believe our disciplined operating philosophy and experienced operational management team will enable us to continue to enhance our leading position in the motion picture exhibition industry. Key components of our strategy include: 
 Focus on Guest Experience. We differentiate our theatres by consistently focusing on the guest experience through a variety of initiatives. We have a market-adaptive approach with our theatre amenities, including Luxury Lounger recliner seats, enhanced food and beverage offerings, and our private-label premium large format, XD. We feature loyalty programs in our largest markets, including the U.S., Brazil, Argentina, Colombia and Central America, which allows us to continue to learn more about our guest preferences and further enrich their movie-going experience. Our innovative and advanced technology selections allow us to consistently deliver the highest quality presentation to fully immerse our guests in the on-screen action. We also train, motivate, and empower our staff to provide first-rate customer service, ensuring our guests are continually pleased with their Cinemark experience. 
Growth in Attendance. Driving attendance is our primary objective. We believe our focus on the guest experience is a catalyst for attendance growth. In addition to the Hollywood content, we also concentrate on initiatives to drive attendance during non-peak times, such as variable pricing methodologies and alternative content, including both participatory and spectator e-sports, Metropolitan Opera, concerts, live and pre-recorded sports, gaming, and other special presentations. We continue to explore other alternatives, including virtual reality and entertainment complexes. We believe our focus on attendance is a primary factor in our consistent industry-leading results. 
 Sustained Investment in Core Circuit Combined with Targeted Growth. We continually invest in our existing circuit to provide the highest quality experience for our guests. We routinely service and update theatre furniture, fixtures and equipment as well as invest in a variety of theatre upgrades such as Luxury Lounger recliner seats, enhanced food and beverage offerings, our XD private-label premium large format, and other amenities. Our commitment to investing in our existing circuit is demonstrated by our level of maintenance capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016, at approximately $199 million and $237 million, respectively. We also continue to target organic growth throughout our global circuit and seek accretive acquisition opportunities, with the objectives of deeper market penetration in the territories in which we currently operate and as a means to enter new and developing markets. We built 144 new auditoriums and acquired 52 auditoriums during the year ended December 31, 2016.

----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We first entered Latin America when we opened a theatre in Chile in 1993. Since then, through our focused international growth strategy, we have developed one of the most geographically diverse theatre circuits in the region. We have balanced our risk through a diversified international portfolio, which includes theatres in thirteen of the fifteen largest metropolitan areas in South America. We have established significant presence in Brazil and Argentina, where we are the largest exhibitor. We also have significant market presence in Colombia and Chile. 
 We believe that certain markets within Latin America continue to be underserved as penetration of movie screens per capita in these markets is substantially lower than in the U.S. and European markets. We intend to continue to build and expand our presence in international markets, with emphasis on Latin America, and fund our expansion primarily with cash flow generated in those markets. We are able to mitigate cash flow exposure to currency fluctuations by transacting local operating expenses primarily in their respective local currencies. Our geographic diversity throughout Latin America has allowed us to maintain consistent local currency revenue growth, notwithstanding currency and economic fluctuations that may affect any particular market. 
 Content and Film Licensing 
 We offer a variety of content at our theatres. We monitor upcoming films and other content and work with film distributors to license the content that we believe will be most successful in our theatres. We play mainstream films from many different genres, such as animated films, family films, dramas, comedies, horror and action films. We offer content in both 2-D and 3-D formats in all of our theatres, and in many locations, we offer our private-label premium format, XD. We also offer a format that features motion seats and added sensory features in addition to the ultra-realistic images of 3-D technology in select locations. 
 We also regularly play art and independent films at many of our U.S. theatres and offer local film product in our international markets, providing a variety of film choices to our guests. We have also established a Classic Series at a majority of our U.S. theatres and some of our international theatres, which involves playing digitally re-mastered classic movies that change on a weekly basis. The program covers many genres of classic films that are generally exhibited during non-peak times. 
 During December 2013, we formed a joint venture, named AC JV, LLC, with Regal Entertainment Group, or Regal, and AMC Entertainment, Inc., or AMC, which then purchased the Fathom event business from National CineMedia, LLC. The Fathom event business generally focuses on the marketing and distribution of live and pre-recorded entertainment programming to movie theatres to augment theatres feature film schedules. AC JV, LLC will continue to bring alternative events to our theatres, including the Metropolitan Opera, sports 
 
9 
 
 programs, concert events, e-sports gaming events and other special presentations, that may be live or pre-recorded. We, along with AC JV, LLC, continue to identify new ways to utilize our theatre platform to provide entertainment to consumers. 
 In the domestic marketplace, our corporate film department negotiates with film distributors to license films for each of our domestic theatres. The film distributors are responsible for determining film release dates and film marketing campaigns and the related expenditures. We are responsible for booking the films at each of our theatres. In most instances, we are able to license each first-run, wide-release film without regard to the bookings of other exhibitors within that area. In certain limited situations, our theatres compete with other nearby theatres for film licenses from film distributors. We face competition for patrons from other exhibitors and other forms of entertainment, as discussed under Competition below, at all of our theatres in all areas. 
 In each of our international offices, our local film personnel negotiate with local offices of major film distributors as well as local film distributors to license films for our international theatres. Our theatre personnel focus on providing excellent customer service, and we provide a high-quality facility with the most up-to-date sound systems, comfortable seating and other amenities preferred by our guests, which we believe gives us a competitive advantage in markets where competing theatres play the same films. 
 In both our domestic and international locations, we pay film rental fees based on a films box office receipts at each of our theatres. Film rental rates are negotiated based on either a firm terms formula, as determined prior to a films run, under which we pay a negotiated rate; a sliding scale formula under which the rate is based on a standard rate matrix that is established prior to a films run; or a rate that is negotiated after a films run. 
 Food and Beverage 
 Concession sales are our second largest revenue source, representing approximately 33% of total revenues. Concession sales have a much higher margin than admissions sales. We have devoted considerable management effort to increasing concession sales by expanding our offerings and adapting to our customers changing preferences, as discussed below. 
 Concession Product Mix. Common concession products offered at all of our theatres include various sizes and types of popcorn, soft drinks, coffees, juice blends, candy and quickly-prepared or pre-prepared food, such as hot dogs, pizza, pretzel bites, nachos and ice cream. Other varieties and flavors of candy, snacks and drinks are offered at theatres based on consumer preferences in that particular market. We have introduced some healthier snack and beverage options for our guests, which are available at some locations, and also added alcohol offerings in a growing number of theatres. 
 Through our enhanced food, Cinemark Reserve and Cinemark Premier concepts, we have expanded concession product offerings to include a broader variety of food and drink options, such as fresh wraps, hot sandwiches, burgers, gourmet pizzas, and a selection of beers, wines, and frozen cocktails, all of which can be enjoyed in the comfort of the auditoriums. We also have lobby bars and VIP lounges in certain domestic and international theatres. 
 Our proprietary point-of-sale system allows us to monitor product sales and readily make adjustments to product mix on a theatre-by-theatre or market-by-market basis, when necessary. This program flexibility also allows us to efficiently activate and manage both national or regional product launches and promotional initiatives to further grow food and beverage sales. 
 Pricing. New products and promotions are introduced on a regular basis to increase concession purchase incidence and generate sales to existing buyers as well as to attract new buyers. We offer specially-priced product combinations at our theatres. We routinely offer discounts to our guests on certain products by offering weekly coupons as well as reusable popcorn tubs and soft drink cups that can be refilled at a discounted price. In certain international countries and in all of our domestic theatres, we offer a loyalty program to our frequent guests which often includes food and beverage benefits. 
 
10 
 
Staff Training. Employees are continually trained in proper sales techniques and maintaining concession product quality. Consumer promotions may include a motivational element that rewards theatre staff for exceptional sales of certain promotional items. 
 Theatre Design. Our theatres are designed to optimize efficiencies at the concession stands, which may include multiple service stations throughout a theatre to facilitate serving guests in an expedited manner. We strategically place large concession stands within theatres to heighten visibility, reduce the length of concession lines, and improve traffic flow around the concession stands. We incorporate self-serve candy cases and bottled drink coolers at our traditional crew-serve theatres to help drive purchase incidence as well as increase product availability for these two core categories. We also have self-service cafeteria-style concession areas in many of our domestic theatres, which allow customers to select their own refreshments and proceed to the cash register when they are ready. This design allows for efficient service, enhanced choices, impulse purchases and superior visibility of concession items. In some of our international locations, we allow guests to pre-order concession items, either online or at a kiosk, and pick them up in a dedicated line at the concession counter. 
 Cost Control. We negotiate prices for concession supplies directly with concession vendors and manufacturers to obtain volume discounts and negotiate rebates. Concession supplies are generally distributed through a distribution network. The concession distributor delivers inventory to the theatres after receiving orders directly from the theatres or through an online electronic ordering system. We conduct frequent inventory counts of concession products at every theatre to ensure proper stock levels are maintained to appropriately serve our customers. 
 Pre-Feature Screen Advertising 
 In our domestic markets, our theatres are part of the in-theatre digital network operated by National CineMedia, LLC, or NCM. NCM provides advertising to our theatres through its branded First Look pre-feature entertainment program and also handles lobby promotions and displays for our theatres. We believe that the reach, scope and digital delivery capability of NCMs network provides an effective platform for national, regional and local advertisers to reach an engaged audience. We receive a monthly theatre access fee for participation in the NCM network and also earn screen advertising revenue on a per patron basis. As of December 31, 2016, we had an approximate 19% ownership interest in NCM. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our investment in NCM. 
 In our international markets, our wholly-owned subsidiary Flix Media Publicidade E Entretenimento, Ltda., or Flix Media, handles our screen advertising functions in Brazil. Our Flix Media marketing personnel work with local agencies and advertisers to coordinate screen advertising in our Brazil theatres. We have expanded the Flix Media advertising services to other exhibitors in Brazil through revenue share agreements. In Argentina, we have in-house personnel that work with local advertisers to arrange screen advertising in our Argentina theatres. We recently acquired advertising businesses in Chile, Central America and Colombia, which we will integrate with our Flix Media division. In our other international markets, we outsource our screen advertising to local companies who have established relationships with local advertisers that provide similar benefits as NCM. The terms of our international screen advertising contracts vary by country. In some of these locations, we earn a percentage of the screen advertising revenues collected by our partners and in other locations we are paid a fixed annual fee for access to our screens. In addition to screen advertising in our theatres, we intend to expand Flix Medias services to include, among other things, alternative content, online ticketing, and loyalty initiatives. 
 Technology Innovations 
 The motion picture exhibition industry has undertaken certain technology initiatives over the past few years, as discussed below.

Digital Cinema Distribution Coalition 
 Through the joint venture DCDC with Regal, AMC, Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc. and Universal Pictures, we began delivering digital content to domestic theatres via satellite during October 2013. As of December 31, 2016, 100% of our domestic auditoriums were capable of receiving content via satellite. Delivery of content via satellite reduces film transportation costs for both distributors and exhibitors, as a portion of the costs to produce and ship hard drives has been eliminated. The satellite delivery system established by DCDC is available to all exhibitors and content providers and allows live and store-and-forward content to be delivered to our theatres. 
Satellite Delivery - International 
 The industry is beginning to expand satellite delivery technology to certain Latin American markets. Currently, 74 of our international theatres have the ability to receive live events via satellite, with some of these also able to receive film content via satellite. We expect all of our international theatres to have the ability to receive content via satellite by the end of 2017. 
Marketing 
 We generally market our theatres and special events, including grand openings and VIP events, using Internet digital advertising, directory film schedules, and radio and television advertising spots. We exhibit previews of coming attractions and current films as part of our on-screen pre-feature program. We offer guests access to movie times, the ability to buy and print their tickets in advance and purchase gift cards at our website www.cinemark.com and via our smart phone and tablet applications. Customers can subscribe to our weekly emails to receive information about current and upcoming films at their preferred Cinemark theatre(s), including details about upcoming Cinemark XD movies, advanced ticket sales, screenings, special events, concerts and live broadcasts; as well as contests, promotions, and coupons for concession savings. Email communications and push notifications are utilized to provide customers with the latest information or exclusive offers such as screenings, contests or promotions. We partner with film distributors on a regular basis to promote their films through local, regional and national programs that are exclusive to our theatres. These programs may involve customer contests that include exclusive giveaways, cross-promotions with the media and other third parties and other means to impact patronage for films showing at our theatres. 
 We interact with guests every day on social media platforms, such as, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, to provide relevant information and quick access to advanced ticketing information, and upcoming movies and events. Guests can utilize social media to ask us questions regarding their local Cinemark theatre offerings, movie-related information or to provide suggestions. 
 We offer a domestic loyalty program to our guests, called Connections, which began in 2016. Connections allows our guests to earn points for different types of transactions and interactions as tracked through our Cinemark smart phone app. Points can then be redeemed for various concession discounts and items, as well as unique and limited edition experiential rewards that relate to films currently playing at our theatres. During 2016, approximately 1.1 million of our guests signed up for Connections. We also offer a feature in our app, called CineMode, which dims the phones screen and rewards guests for silencing their phones during the movie. Guests are rewarded for use of CineMode with loyalty points as well as other exclusive digital rewards that can be used at a future visit to one of our theatres. 
 We also have loyalty programs in most of our international markets that allow customers to pay a nominal fee for a membership card that provides them with certain admissions and concession discounts. Our Connections and other loyalty programs put us in direct contact with our guests and provides additional opportunities for us to further expand our relationships with the studios and our vendors through promotions.
 Our domestic and international marketing departments also focus on expanding ancillary revenue, which includes the sale of our gift cards and our SuperSaver discount tickets. We generally market these programs to 
 
12 
 
 businesses as an employee-incentive or rewards program. Our marketing departments also coordinate the use of our auditoriums, generally during off-peak times, for corporate meetings, private movie screenings, brand and product launches, education and training sessions or other private events, which contribute to our ancillary revenue. 
 Competition 
 We are one of the leaders in the motion picture exhibition industry. We compete against local, regional, national and international exhibitors with respect to attracting guests, licensing films and developing new theatre sites. Our primary U.S. competitors include Regal and AMC and our primary international competitors, which vary by country, include Cinépolis, Cine Colombia, CinePlanet, Kinoplex (GSR), and Araujo. 
 We are generally able to book films without regard to the film bookings of other exhibitors at many of our theatres. In certain limited situations, distributors allocate movies to only one theatre in a market generally based on demographics, the conditions, capacity and grossing potential of each theatre, and the terms of exhibition. In all theatres, our success in attracting guests depends on customer service quality, location, theatre capacity, quality of projection and sound equipment, film showtime availability and ticket prices. 
 We compete for new theatre sites with other movie theatre exhibitors as well as other entertainment venues. Securing a potential site depends upon factors such as committed investment and resources, theatre design and capacity, revenue potential, and financial stability. 
 We also face competition from a number of other motion picture exhibition delivery systems, such as digital downloads, video on-demand, pay-per-view television, DVDs, network and syndicated television. We also face competition from other forms of entertainment competing for the publics leisure time and disposable income, such as concerts, theme parks and sporting events. 
 Seasonality 
 Our revenues have historically been seasonal, coinciding with the timing of releases of motion pictures by the major distributors. Generally, the most successful motion pictures have been released during the summer, extending from May to July, and during the holiday season, extending from early November through year-end. The unexpected emergence of a hit film during other periods can alter this seasonality trend. The timing and quality of such film releases can have a significant impact on our results of operations, and the results of one period are not necessarily indicative of results for the following period or for the same period in the following year. 
Corporate Operations 
 Our worldwide headquarters is located in Plano, Texas. Personnel at our corporate headquarters provide oversight and support for our domestic and international theatres, including our executive team and department heads in charge of film licensing, food and beverage, theatre operations, theatre construction and maintenance, real estate, human resources, marketing, legal, finance, accounting, tax, audit and information technology. Our U.S. operations are divided into nineteen regions, each of which is headed by a region leader. We have nine regional offices in Latin America responsible for the local management of theatres in fifteen countries (Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Guatemala and Curacao are managed out of one Central American regional office). Each regional office is headed by a general manager with additional personnel responsible for film licensing, marketing, human resources, information technology, operations and finance. We have chief financial officers in Brazil and Argentina, which are our two largest international markets and a regional chief financial officer located in Chile that oversees Chile, Bolivia and Paraguay. 
Employees 
 We have approximately 19,200 employees in the U.S., approximately 20% of whom are full time employees and 80% of whom are part time employees. We have approximately 9,300 employees in our international 
 
13 
 
 markets, approximately 34% of whom are full time employees and approximately 66% of whom are part time employees. Due to the seasonal nature of our business as discussed above, our headcount can vary throughout the year, depending on the timing and success of movie releases. Some of our international locations are subject to union regulations. We regard our relations with our employees to be satisfactory. 
 Regulations 
 The distribution of motion pictures is largely regulated by federal and state antitrust laws and has been the subject of numerous antitrust cases. The manner in which we can license films from certain major film distributors has been influenced by consent decrees resulting from these cases. Consent decrees bind certain major film distributors and require the films of such distributors to be offered and licensed to exhibitors, including Cinemark, on a theatre-by-theatre and film-by-film basis. Consequently, exhibitors cannot enter into long-term arrangements with major distributors, but must negotiate for licenses on a theatre-by-theatre and film-by-film basis. 
 We are subject to various general regulations applicable to our operations including the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, or the ADA, and regulations recently issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that require nutrition labels for certain menu items. Our domestic and international theatre operations are also subject to federal, state and local laws governing such matters as wages, working conditions, citizenship, health and sanitation requirements and various business licensing and permitting.
