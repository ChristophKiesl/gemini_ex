Item 1. | Business.

IDEX Corporation (“IDEX,” the “Company,” “us,” “our,” or “we”) is a Delaware corporation incorporated on September 24, 1987. The Company is an applied solutions business that sells an extensive array of pumps, valves, flow meters and other fluidics systems and components and engineered products to customers in a variety of markets around the world. All of the Company’s business activities are carried out through wholly-owned subsidiaries.
The Company has three reportable business segments: Fluid & Metering Technologies (“FMT”), Health & Science Technologies (“HST”) and Fire & Safety/Diversified Products (“FSDP”). Within our three reportable segments, the Company maintains thirteen platforms, where we focus on organic growth and strategic acquisitions. Each of our thirteen platforms is also a reporting unit, where we annually test for goodwill impairment. 
During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company reorganized certain of its reporting units to align with changes in management and as a result of certain divestitures as well as to align with how management will run the business going forward as follows:
•Moved the Richter and Aegis businesses from the previous Industrial reporting unit to the Valves reporting unit;
•Moved the Trebor business from the previous Industrial reporting unit to the Water reporting unit;

• | Replaced the previous Industrial reporting unit with the Pumps reporting unit, which now includes Viking and Warren Rupp;


• | Combined the Scientific Fluidics and IDEX Optics & Photonics reporting units into the Scientific Fluidics & Optics reporting unit; and


• | Combined the Fire Suppression and Rescue reporting units into the Fire & Safety reporting unit.

The Fluid & Metering Technologies segment contains the Energy (comprised of Corken, Faure Herman, Liquid Controls, SAMPI, and Toptech), Valves (comprised of Alfa Valvole, Richter, and Aegis), Water (comprised of Pulsafeeder, Knight, ADS, Trebor, and iPEK), Pumps (comprised of Viking and Warren Rupp), and Agriculture (comprised of Banjo) platforms. The Health & Science Technologies segment contains the Scientific Fluidics & Optics (comprised of Eastern Plastics, Rheodyne, Sapphire Engineering, Upchurch Scientific, ERC, CiDRA Precision Services, CVI Melles Griot, Semrock, and AT Films), Sealing Solutions (comprised of Precision Polymer Engineering, FTL Seals Technology, Novotema, and SFC Koenig), Gast, Micropump, and Material Processing Technologies (comprised of Quadro, Fitzpatrick, Microfluidics, and Matcon) platforms. The Fire & Safety/Diversified Products segment is comprised of the Fire & Safety (comprised of Class 1, Hale, Godiva, Akron Brass, AWG Fittings, Dinglee, Hurst Jaws of Life, Lukas, and Vetter), Band-It, and Dispensing platforms. 
IDEX believes that each of its reporting units is a leader in its product and service areas. The Company also believes that its strong financial performance has been attributable to its ability to design and engineer specialized quality products, coupled with its ability to identify and successfully consummate and integrate strategic acquisitions.
