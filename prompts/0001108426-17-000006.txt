ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

THE COMPANY
Overview 
PNMR is an investor-owned holding company with two regulated utilities providing electricity and electric services in New Mexico and Texas. PNMR’s electric utilities are PNM and TNMP. PNMR is focused on achieving the following strategic goals:

• | Earning authorized returns on its regulated businesses


• | Delivering above industry-average earnings and dividend growth


• | Maintaining solid investment grade credit ratings

PNMR’s success in accomplishing these strategic goals is highly dependent on continued favorable regulatory treatment for its regulated utilities. Both PNM and TNMP seek cost recovery for their investments through general rate cases and various rate riders. PNM filed a general rate case in December 2016 that is pending before the NMPRC. Additional information about rate filings is provided in Operations and Regulation below and in Note 17.

OPERATIONS AND REGULATION
Regulated Operations
PNM 
PNM is an electric utility that provides electric generation, transmission, and distribution service to its rate-regulated customers. In New Mexico, the utility’s retail electric service territory covers a large area of north central New Mexico, including the cities of Albuquerque, Rio Rancho, and Santa Fe, and certain areas of southern New Mexico. Service to retail electric customers is subject to the jurisdiction of the NMPRC. PNM has decided to stop pursuing wholesale generation contracts although some sales continue to be made to wholesale customers. Service to wholesale customers is regulated by FERC. Regulation encompasses the utility’s electric rates, service, accounting, issuances of securities, construction of major new generation, types of generation resources, transmission and distribution facilities, and other matters. See Note 17 for additional information on rate cases and other regulatory matters.
Other services provided by PNM include transmission services to third parties as well as the generation and sale of electricity into the wholesale market, which services are regulated by FERC. PNM owns or leases transmission lines, interconnected with other utilities in New Mexico, Texas, Arizona, Colorado, and Utah. The largest retail electric customer served by PNM accounted for 2.5% of its revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016. PNM was incorporated in the State of New Mexico in 1917. 
NMPRC Regulated Retail Rate Proceedings
Customer rates for retail electric service are set by the NMPRC. On October 1, 2016, PNM implemented a NMPRC order in PNM’s NM 2015 Rate Case that approved an increase in non-fuel base rates of $61.2 million annually. PNM is appealing certain aspects of the NMPRC’s order in the NM Supreme Court. Other parties in that rate case have filed cross-appeals contesting other aspects of the NMPRC ruling. See Note 17.
In December 2016, PNM filed a new general rate case (the “NM 2016 Rate Case”) with the NMPRC. The December 2016 application proposes a revenue increase of $99.2 million above the October 1, 2016 rates to be effective on January 1, 2018. The requested increase is based on a calendar 2018 future test year (“FTY”) and a ROE of 10.125% compared to a ROE of 9.575% authorized in the NM 2015 Rate Case. The primary drivers of PNM’s identified revenue deficiency are the implementation of the plan for SJGS to comply with the CAA (Note 16), including the shutdown of Units 2 and 3 of SJGS, recovery of 50% of the net book value of those units, and the inclusion in retail rates of PVNGS Unit 3 as replacement power. The increase also reflects new infrastructure investments and declines in forecasted energy sales resulting from PNM’s successful energy efficiency programs and other economic factors. PNM also proposes changes to rate design to better align electric rates with the actual costs to serve customers and encourage continued energy efficiency while proposing a rate mechanism that eliminates the disincentives associated with energy efficiency and load management programs. 
PNM has a NMPRC-approved rate rider to collect costs for renewable energy procurements that are not otherwise being collected in rates. If PNM’s earned return on jurisdictional equity in a calendar year, adjusted for weather and other items not representative of normal operation, exceeds the NMPRC-approved rate by 0.5%, the rider provides that PNM would refund the excess to customers during the following year. PNM’s earned return on jurisdictional equity did not exceed the limitation in 2014, 2015, or 2016. The NMPRC has also approved riders designed to allow PNM to bill and collect substantially all of fuel and purchased power costs and costs of approved energy efficiency initiatives.

FERC Regulated Wholesale Operations
In December 2012, PNM filed a notice with FERC to increase its wholesale electric transmission rates for all of its transmission customers. The filing represents a formula-based rate as contemplated by the approved settlement in PNM’s previous transmission rate case. On March 20, 2015, PNM along with five other parties entered into a settlement agreement, which was filed at FERC. The settlement reflects a ROE of 10% and results in an annual increase of $1.3 million above the rates approved in the previous rate case. The FERC ALJ authorized the interim implementation of settled rates beginning on April 1, 2015, subject to refund. On March 17, 2016, FERC approved the settlement. 
PNM has entered into firm-requirements wholesale contracts to provide electricity to various customers. These contracts contain both capacity charges and energy charges. Capacity charges are monthly payments for a commitment of resources to service the contract requirements. Energy charges are payments based on the amount of electricity delivered to the customer and are intended to compensate for the variable costs incurred to provide the energy. The average billing demands for PNM’s firm-requirements wholesale customers aggregated approximately 59 MW and 62 MW in 2016 and 2015. No firm-requirements customer of PNM accounted for more than 2.0% of PNM’s revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016.
PNM’s current authorization under FERC regulation requires that revenue requirements for sales of electricity at wholesale are to be based on PNM’s costs of providing such service. In August 2014, PNM filed an application with FERC to allow PNM to enter into arrangements to sell electricity at wholesale prices within PNM’s balancing authority area using rates that are based on market conditions. In October 2015, FERC denied PNM’s request. Currently, PNM does not plan to pursue obtaining authority for market-based rates within the PNM balancing authority area.
In September 2011, PNM filed with FERC to increase rates for electric service and ancillary services provided to NEC, PNM’s largest firm-requirements wholesale customer. The parties agreed to a settlement providing for an increase in rates of $5.3 million and an extension of the contract for 10 years through December 31, 2035. FERC approved the settlement in April 2013. On April 8, 2015, NEC filed a petition for a declaratory order requesting that FERC find that NEC can purchase an unlimited amount of power and energy from third-party supplier(s) under the PSA. PNM intervened, requesting that FERC deny NEC’s petition. On October 29, 2015, PNM and NEC entered into and filed with FERC a settlement agreement that includes amendments to the PSA and related contracts, subject to FERC approval. FERC approved the settlement on January 21, 2016. Under the agreement, PNM served all of NEC’s load in 2016 at reduced demand and energy rates from those under the PSA. The PSA terminated on December 31, 2016. In 2017, PNM will continue to serve 10 MW of NEC’s load under a short-term coordination tariff at a rate lower than provided under the PSA, but higher than prices available under short-term market rates at the time of the settlement. In 2016, 2015, and 2014, monthly billing demand for power supplied to NEC averaged approximately 54 MW, 54 MW, and 55 MW and revenues were $20.0 million, $27.1 million, and $28.4 million under the PSA. 
PNM provided both energy and power services to Gallup, which was its second largest firm-requirements wholesale customer, under an electric service agreement that expired on June 30, 2014. PNM also provided electricity at wholesale to the City of Aztec, New Mexico under a contract that expired on June 30, 2016. In 2014, PNM entered into a contract with the Jicarilla Apache Nation to provide electricity at wholesale through May 8, 2019, although the customer had the option to terminate the contract upon appropriate notice. In accordance with the contract, the Jicarilla Apache Nation terminated the contract effective December 1, 2016. 
PNM’s recently filed general rate cases discussed above include a reallocation of assets and costs among regulatory jurisdictions, primarily to retail customers, reflecting the termination of these contracts. See Results of Operations in MD&A and Note 17. 
Operational Information
Weather-normalized retail electric KWh sales decreased by 0.7% in 2016 and 1.4% in 2015. The system peak demands for retail and firm-requirements customers were as follows:
System Peak Demands

 | 2016 | 2015 | | 2014
 | (Megawatts)
Summer | 1,908 | | 1,889 | | 1,878
Winter | 1,376 | | 1,433 | | 1,471

A - 3

PNM holds long-term, non-exclusive franchise agreements for its electric retail operations, with varying expiration dates. These franchise agreements allow the utility to access public rights-of-way for placement of its electric facilities. Franchise agreements have expired in some areas PNM serves, including Albuquerque, Rio Rancho, and Santa Fe. Because PNM remains obligated under New Mexico state law to provide service to customers in these areas, the expirations should not have a material adverse impact. The Albuquerque, Rio Rancho, and Santa Fe metropolitan areas accounted for 48.1%, 9.9%, and 9.5% of PNM’s 2016 revenues and no other franchise area represents more than 5%. Although PNM is not required to collect or pay franchise fees in some areas it serves, the utility continues to collect and pay such fees in certain parts of its service territory, including Albuquerque, Rio Rancho, and Santa Fe. 
As discussed in Note 16, the County Commission of Bernalillo County, New Mexico passed an ordinance on January 28, 2014 that would require PNM and other utilities to enter into a use agreement and pay a yet-to-be-determined fee as a condition for installing, maintaining, and operating facilities on county rights-of-way. PNM and other utilities have filed complaints in federal and state courts challenging the validity of the ordinance. If the challenge to the ordinance is unsuccessful, PNM believes any fees paid pursuant to the ordinance would be considered franchise fees and would be recoverable from customers. PNM is unable to predict the outcome of this matter.
PNM owns 3,200 circuit miles of electric transmission lines that interconnect with other utilities in New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado, Texas, and Utah. There has been little development of new transmission facilities in recent years. Therefore, PNM’s transmission system is fully committed during peak hours for delivery of existing resources, with very little to no additional access available on a firm commitment basis. These factors result in physical constraints on the system and limit the ability to bring power into PNM’s service area from outside of New Mexico. 
PNM also generates and sells electricity into the wholesale market. Because PNM’s 134 MW share of Unit 3 at PVNGS currently is excluded from retail rates, that unit’s power is being sold in the wholesale market and shareholders realize any earnings or losses. PNM has contracted to sell all of PVNGS Unit 3 output through 2017 at market price plus a premium.  Through hedging arrangements that are accounted for as economic hedges, PNM has established fixed rates for substantially all of these sales. In December 2015, the NMPRC approved PNM’s request to include PVNGS Unit 3 as a jurisdictional resource to serve New Mexico retail customers beginning in 2018 as part of the revised plan to comply with the regional haze requirements of the CAA, which PNM reflected in PNM’s NM 2016 Rate Case filed in December 2016. See Note 16 and Note 17. In addition to the PVNGS contracts, PNM also engages in activities to optimize its existing jurisdictional assets and long-term power agreements through spot market, hour-ahead, day-ahead, week-ahead, and other sales of any excess generation not required to fulfill retail load and contractual commitments. Through PNM’s FPPAC, 90% of the margins from these optimization sales were credited to retail customers through December 31, 2016, after which date 100% of the margins are credited to customers. 
Use of Future Test Year (“FTY”)
Under New Mexico law, the NMPRC must set rates using the test period, including a FTY, that best reflects the conditions the utility will experience when new rates are anticipated to go into effect. In November 2015, the NMPRC clarified that FTY could begin up to 13 months after the filing of a rate case application. The NMPRC also must include certain construction work in progress (“CWIP”) for environmental improvement, generation, and transmission projects in rate base. These provisions are designed to promote more timely recovery of reasonable costs of providing utility service. 
The use of a FTY should help PNM mitigate the adverse effects of regulatory lag, which is inherent when using a historical test year. Accordingly, the utility’s earnings should more closely reflect the rate of return allowed by the NMPRC. PNMR believes that achieving earnings that approximate its allowed rate of return is an important factor in attracting equity investors, as well as being considered favorably by credit rating agencies and financial analysts. 
As discussed above, PNM’s pending request for a general rate increase is based on a FTY period beginning January 1, 2018. As with any forward looking financial information, utilizing a FTY in a rate filing presents challenges. These include forecasts of both operating and capital expenditures that necessitate reliance on many assumptions concerning future conditions and operating results. In the rate making process, PNM’s assumptions are subject to challenge by regulators and intervenors who may assert different interpretations or assumptions. 
Renewable Energy
The REA was enacted to encourage the development of renewable energy in New Mexico. The act establishes a mandatory RPS requiring a utility to acquire a renewable energy portfolio equal to 10% of retail electric sales by 2011, 15% by 2015, and 20% by 2020. The act provides for streamlined proceedings for approval of utilities’ renewable energy procurement plans, assures utilities recovery of costs incurred consistent with approved procurement plans, and requires the NMPRC to establish a RCT for 
A - 4

the procurement of renewable resources to prevent excessive costs being added to rates. PNM files required renewable energy plans with the NMPRC annually and makes procurements consistent with the plans approved by the NMPRC. See Note 17.
TNMP 
TNMP is a regulated utility operating and incorporated in the State of Texas. TNMP’s predecessor was organized in 1925. TNMP provides transmission and distribution services in Texas under the provisions of TECA and the Texas Public Utility Regulatory Act. TNMP is subject to traditional cost-of-service regulation with respect to rates and service under the jurisdiction of the PUCT and certain municipalities. TNMP’s transmission and distribution activities are solely within ERCOT, which is the independent system operator responsible for maintaining reliable operations for the bulk electric power supply system in most of Texas. Therefore, TNMP is not subject to traditional rate regulation by FERC. TNMP serves a market of small to medium sized communities, most of which have populations of less than 50,000. TNMP is the exclusive provider of transmission and distribution services in most areas it serves. 
TNMP’s service territory consists of three non-contiguous areas. One portion of this territory extends from Lewisville, which is approximately 10 miles north of the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, eastward to municipalities near the Red River, and to communities north, west, and south of Fort Worth. The second portion of its service territory includes the area along the Texas Gulf Coast between Houston and Galveston, and the third portion includes areas of far west Texas between Midland and El Paso. 
TNMP provides transmission and distribution services at regulated rates to various REPs that, in turn, provide retail electric service to consumers within TNMP’s service area. TNMP experienced increases in weather-normalized retail KWh sales of 3.0% in 2016 and 2.6% in 2015. As of December 31, 2016, 102 active REPs receive transmission and distribution services from TNMP. In 2016, the three largest REP customers of TNMP accounted for operating revenues of 16%, 11%, and 11%. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of revenues.
Regulatory Activities
In July 2011, the PUCT approved a settlement and authorized an AMS deployment plan that permits TNMP to collect $113.4 million in deployment costs through a surcharge over a 12-year period. TNMP began collecting the surcharge on August 11, 2011. Deployment of advanced meters began in September 2011. TNMP completed its mass deployment of AMS in 2016 and has installed more than 242,000 advanced meters.
The PUCT approved interim adjustments to TNMP’s transmission rates of $2.9 million in March 2014, $4.2 million in September 2014, $4.4 million in March 2015, $1.4 million in September 2015, $4.3 million in March 2016, and $1.8 million in September 2016. On January 20, 2017, TNMP filed an application to further update its transmission rates, which would increase revenues by $4.8 million annually. The application is pending before the PUCT. See Note 17.
Franchise Agreements
TNMP holds long-term, non-exclusive franchise agreements for its electric transmission and distribution services. These agreements have varying expiration dates and some have expired. TNMP intends to negotiate and execute new or amended franchise agreements with municipalities where the agreements have expired or will be expiring. Since TNMP is the exclusive provider of transmission and distribution services in most areas that it serves, the need to renew or renegotiate franchise agreements should not have a material adverse impact. TNMP also earns revenues from service provided to facilities in its service area that lie outside the territorial jurisdiction of the municipalities with which TNMP has franchise agreements.
Corporate and Other
The Corporate and Other segment includes PNMR holding company activities, primarily related to corporate level debt and to PNMR Services Company. PNMR Services Company provides corporate services through shared services agreements to PNMR and all of PNMR’s business units, including PNM and TNMP. These services are charged and billed at cost on a monthly basis to the business units. The activities of PNMR Development and NM Capital are also included in Corporate and Other.

SOURCES OF POWER
PNM
Generation Capacity
As of December 31, 2016, the total net generation capacity of facilities owned or leased by PNM was 2,481 MW. PNM also obtains power under long-term PPAs for the power produced by New Mexico Wind, which has a capacity of 204 MW, the Lightning Dock Geothermal facility, which currently has a capacity of 4 MW, and Red Mesa Wind, which has a capacity of 102 MW. 
PNM’s capacity in electric generating facilities, which are owned, leased, or under PPAs, in commercial service as of December 31, 2016 is:

Fossil‑Fueled Plants
SJGS consists of four units operated by PNM. Units 1, 2, 3, and 4 at SJGS have net rated capacities of 340 MW, 340 MW, 497 MW and 507 MW. SJGS Units 1 and 2 are owned on a 50% shared basis with Tucson. SJGS Unit 3 is owned 50% by PNM, 41.8% by SCPPA, and 8.2% by Tri‑State. SJGS Unit 4 is owned 38.457% by PNM, 28.8% by MSR, 10.04% by Anaheim, 8.475% by Farmington, 7.2% by Los Alamos, and 7.028% by UAMPS. See Note 16 for additional information about SJGS, including the shutdown of Units 2 and 3 on December 31, 2017 and the restructuring of the ownership interests in SJGS. Under the restructuring agreement, PNM would own 64.5% of Unit 4, PNMR Development would own 12.8% of Unit 4, and SCPPA, Tri-State, MSR, and Anaheim would no longer have any ownership interest in SJGS following the December 31, 2017 restructuring. PNMR anticipates that the interest of PNMR Development will be transferred to PNM, as authorized by the NMPRC, prior to the restructuring date.
Four Corners Units 4 and 5 are 13% owned by PNM. These units are jointly owned with APS, an APS affiliate, SRP, and Tucson and are operated by APS. PNM had no ownership interest in Four Corners Units 1, 2, or 3, which were shut down by APS on December 30, 2013. The Four Corners plant site is leased from the Navajo Nation and is also subject to an easement from the federal government. APS, on behalf of the Four Corners participants, negotiated amendments to an existing facility lease with the Navajo Nation, which extends the Four Corners leasehold interest from 2016 to 2041. The Navajo Nation approved these amendments in March 2011. The effectiveness of the amendments also required the approval of the DOI, as did a related federal rights-of-way grant, which was received in July 2015. An affiliate of APS acquired the 7% interest formerly owned by EPE on July 7, 2016. NTEC, an entity owned by the Navajo Nation, has the option to purchase the 7% interest. NTEC provided notice of its intent to exercise the option, but has not yet acquired the 7% interest. See Note 16 for additional information about Four Corners.
A - 6

PNM owns 100% of Reeves, Afton, Rio Bravo, Lordsburg, and La Luz and one-third of Luna. The remaining interests in Luna are owned equally by Tucson and Samchully Power & Utilities 1, LLC. Prior to July 17, 2014, when PNM closed on the purchase of Rio Bravo, PNM was entitled to the energy and capacity of Rio Bravo under a PPA. PNM is entitled to the entire output of Valencia under a PPA. Valencia is a variable interest entity and is consolidated by PNM as required by GAAP. Reeves, Lordsburg, Rio Bravo, La Luz, and Valencia are used primarily for peaking power and transmission support. See Note 9 for additional information about Rio Bravo and Valencia.
Nuclear Plant 
PNM is participating in the three units of PVNGS, also known as the Arizona Nuclear Power Project, with APS (the operating agent), SRP, EPE, SCE, SCPPA, and the Department of Water and Power of the City of Los Angeles. PNM is entitled to 10.2% of the power and energy generated by PVNGS, including portions that are leased to PNM. See Note 7 for additional information concerning the PVNGS leases, including the renewal of the four PVNGS Unit 1 leases and one of the PVNGS Unit 2 leases and the purchase of the assets underlying the other three Unit 2 leases and Note 17 for information about the ratemaking treatment by the NMPRC. Following the January 15, 2016 exercise of the Unit 2 purchase options, PNM has ownership interests of 2.3% in Unit 1, 9.4% in Unit 2, and 10.2% in Unit 3 and has leasehold interests of 7.9% in Unit 1 and 0.8% in Unit 2. The lease payments for the leased portions of PVNGS are recovered through retail rates approved by the NMPRC. See Note 16 for information on other PVNGS matters, including the NMPRC’s approval of PNM’s proposal to include PVNGS Unit 3 as a jurisdictional resource to serve New Mexico retail customers and Note 17 for information concerning the NMPRC’s treatment of the purchased assets and extended leases in PNM’s NM 2015 Rate Case.
Solar
PNM completed its first major utility-owned renewable energy project aggregating 22 MW when five utility-scale solar facilities in New Mexico went online in 2011. PNM also completed its solar-storage demonstration project in Albuquerque, which has a generation capacity of 0.5 MW and is included in the above table. PNM completed the installation of additional PNM-owned solar PV facilities of 21.5 MW at four sites, including expansion of capacity at two of the existing sites, in 2013; 23 MW at three additional sites in 2014; and 40 MW at four additional sites in 2015. As discussed in Note 17, PNMR Development will construct, beginning in 2017, and own 30 MW of new solar capacity that PNM will use to supply power to a new data center being constructed by Facebook Inc. in PNM’s service territory. The NMPRC has approved a voluntary tariff that allows PNM retail customers to buy renewable electricity for a small monthly premium. Power from 1.5 MW of PNM’s solar capacity is used to service load under the voluntary tariff. 
Plant Operating Statistics
Equivalent availability of PNM’s major base-load generating stations was:

Plant | Operator | 2016 | 2015 | 2014 
SJGS | PNM | 76.5% | 67.4% | 76.5%
Four Corners | APS | 62.0% | 77.8% | 68.1%
PVNGS | APS | 91.4% | 94.2% | 91.8%

Joint Projects
SJGS, PVNGS, Four Corners, and Luna are joint projects each owned or leased by several different entities. Some participants in the joint projects are investor-owned entities, while others are privately, municipally, or co-operatively owned. Furthermore, participants in SJGS have varying percentage interests in different generating units within the project. The primary operating or participation agreements for the joint projects expire in July 2022 for SJGS, July 2041 for Four Corners, December 2046 for Luna, and November 2047 for PVNGS. Also, SJGS and Four Corners are coal-fired generating plants that obtain their coal requirements from mines near the plants. A new agreement for coal supply for SJGS, which expires on June 30, 2022, became effective at 11:59 PM on January 31, 2016. At that same time, an agreement to restructure the ownership in SJGS became effective. That agreement provides for certain existing participants in SJGS to exit ownership at December 31, 2017, at which time Units 2 and 3 of the four SJGS units will be permanently shut down. See Note 16 for a discussion of the restructuring of SJGS ownership. In December 2013, a new coal supply arrangement for Four Corners that runs through July 6, 2031 was executed. As described above, Four Corners is situated on land under a lease from the Navajo Nation. Portions of PNM’s interests in PVNGS Units 1 and 2 are leased. See Nuclear Plant above and Note 7 regarding PNM’s actions related to these leases. 
A - 7

It is possible that other participants in the joint projects have circumstances and objectives that have changed from those existing at the time of becoming participants. The status of these joint projects is further complicated by the uncertainty surrounding the form of potential legislation and/or regulation of CCBs, GHG, and other air emissions, as well as the impacts of the costs of compliance and operational viability of all or certain units within the joint projects. It is unclear how these factors will enter into discussion and negotiations concerning the status of the joint projects as the expiration of basic operational agreements approaches. PNM can provide no assurance that its participation in the joint projects will continue in the manner that currently exists. 
PPAs 
In addition to generating its own power, PNM purchases power under long-term PPAs. PNM also purchases power in the forward, day-ahead, and real-time markets. 
In 2002, PNM entered into an agreement with FPL to develop New Mexico Wind. PNM began receiving power from the project in June 2003. FPL owns and operates New Mexico Wind, which consists of 136 wind-powered turbines having an aggregate capacity of 204 MW on a site in eastern New Mexico. PNM has a contract to purchase all the power and RECs generated by New Mexico Wind for 25 years. Power from New Mexico Wind is used to service load under the voluntary tariff discussed above and as part of PNM’s electric supply mix for meeting retail load. 
PNM has a 20-year agreement to purchase energy and RECs from the Lightning Dock Geothermal facility built near Lordsburg, New Mexico. The facility, which is the first geothermal project for the PNM system, began providing limited power to PNM on January 1, 2014. The current capacity of the facility is 4 MW. 
In June 2013, PNM entered into a 20-year PPA with Red Mesa Wind, LLC, a subsidiary of NextEra Energy Resources, LLC, to purchase all of the power and RECs produced by Red Mesa Wind beginning on January 1, 2015. Red Mesa Wind, LLC owns and operates the facility, which consists of 64 wind-powered turbines having an aggregate capacity of 102 MW on a site west of Albuquerque.
On June 1, 2016, PNM and Tri-State entered into a one-year hazard sharing agreement, which expires on May 31, 2017, under which each party will sell the other party 100 MW of capacity and energy on a unit contingent basis.  Both the purchases and sales are made at the same market index price.  In 2016, PNM sold 482,342 MWh for $12.8 million and purchased 484,632 MWh for $12.9 million under the agreement. The agreement serves to reduce the magnitude of each party’s single largest generating hazard and assists in enhancing the reliability and efficiency of their respective operations. PNM and Tri-State have entered into an additional agreement, under substantially identical terms, for a term of five years beginning June 1, 2017, subject to NMPRC approval. PNM filed an application with the NMPRC for approval of the five-year agreement and a public hearing is scheduled to begin on March 23, 2017. See Note 17.

FUEL AND WATER SUPPLY
PNM
The percentages of PNM’s generation of electricity (on the basis of KWh), including Valencia and Rio Bravo, fueled by coal, nuclear fuel, and gas and oil, and the average costs to PNM of those fuels per MMBTU were as follows:

 | Coal | | Nuclear | | Gas and Oil 
 | Percent ofGeneration | | AverageCost | | Percent ofGeneration | AverageCost | | Percent ofGeneration | AverageCost
2016 | 54.1 | % | | $ | 2.34 | | 31.6 | % | $ | 0.71 | 11.8 | % | $ | 2.80
2015 | 53.3 | % | | $ | 2.88 | | 32.6 | % | $ | 0.70 | 12.6 | % | $ | 2.91
2014 | 56.7 | % | | $ | 3.00 | | 32.0 | % | $ | 0.83 | 10.3 | % | $ | 4.26

In 2016, 2015, and 2014, 2.5%, 1.5%, and 1.0% of PNM’s generation was from utility owned solar, which has no fuel cost. The generation mix for 2017 is expected to be 54.8% coal, 28.2% nuclear, 14.8% gas and oil, and 2.2% utility owned solar. Due to locally available natural gas and oil supplies, the utilization of locally available coal deposits, and the generally adequate supply of nuclear fuel, PNM believes that adequate sources of fuel are available for its generating stations into the foreseeable future. See Sources of Power – PNM – PPAs for information concerning the cost of purchased power. PNM recovers substantially all of it fuel and purchased power costs through the FPPAC.
Coal
A new coal supply contract for SJGS, which expires on June 30, 2022, became effective at 11:59 PM on January 31, 2016. Substantially all of the benefits of lower coal pricing under the new contract are being passed through to PNM’s customers under the FPPAC. Coal supply has not been arranged for periods after the existing contract expires. PNM believes there is adequate availability of coal resources to continue to operate SJGS although an extended or new contract could result in higher prices. In 2018 and before entering into a binding agreement for post-2022 coal supply for SJGS, PNM must file its position and supporting testimony in a NMPRC case to determine the extent to which SJGS should continue serving PNM’s retail customers’ needs after mid-2022. To facilitate the 2018 filing, PNM is developing two resource portfolios in its 2017 IRP to be filed in July 2017, one with SJGS continuing beyond mid-2022 and one where it is shut down.
In late December 2013, a new fifteen-year coal supply contract for Four Corners, beginning in July 2016, was executed. The average coal price per MMBTU under the new contract was approximately 48% higher in the second half of 2016 than in the second half of 2015. The contract provides for pricing adjustments over its term based on economic indices. See Note 16 for additional information about PNM’s coal supply. 
Natural Gas
The natural gas used as fuel for the electric generating plants is procured on the open market and delivered by third party transportation providers. The supply of natural gas can be subject to disruptions due to extreme weather events and/or pipeline or facility outages. PNM has contracted for firm gas transmission capacity to minimize the potential for disruptions due to extreme weather events. Certain of PNM’s natural gas plants are generally used as peaking resources that are highly relied upon during periods of extreme weather, which also may be the times natural gas has the highest demand from other users.
Nuclear Fuel and Waste 
PNM is one of several participants in PVNGS. The PVNGS participants are continually identifying their future nuclear fuel resource needs and negotiating arrangements to fill those needs. The PVNGS participants have contracted for 100% of PVNGS’s requirements for uranium concentrates and conversion services through 2018 and 45% of those requirements for 2019-2025. In addition, the participants have contracted for 100% of PVNGS’s enrichment services through 2020 and 20% for 2021-2026. All of PVNGS’s fuel assembly fabrication services are contracted through 2024.
The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 required the DOE to begin to accept, transport, and dispose of spent nuclear fuel and high level waste generated by the nation’s nuclear power plants by 1998. The DOE’s obligations are reflected in a contract with each nuclear power plant. The DOE failed to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel by 1998. APS (on behalf of itself and the other PVNGS participants) has pursued legal actions. See Note 16 for information concerning these actions. 
The DOE had planned to meet its disposal obligations by designing, licensing, constructing, and operating a permanent geologic repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. In March 2010, the DOE filed a motion to dismiss with prejudice its Yucca 
A - 9

Mountain construction authorization application that was pending before the NRC. Several interested parties have intervened in the NRC proceeding. Additionally, a number of interested parties have filed a variety of lawsuits in different jurisdictions around the country challenging the DOE’s authority to withdraw the Yucca Mountain construction authorization application. None of these lawsuits has been conclusively decided by the courts. However, in August 2013, the DC Circuit ordered the NRC to resume its review of the application with available appropriated funds.
On October 16, 2014, the NRC issued Volume 3 of the safety evaluation report developed as part of the Yucca Mountain construction authorization application. This volume addresses repository safety after permanent closure, and its issuance is a key milestone in the Yucca Mountain licensing process. Volume 3 contains the staff’s finding that the DOE’s repository design meets the requirements that apply after the repository is permanently closed, including but not limited to the post-closure performance objectives in NRC’s regulations. On December 18, 2014, the NRC issued Volume 4 of the safety evaluation report developed as part of the Yucca Mountain construction authorization application. This volume covers administrative and programmatic requirements for the repository. It documents the staff’s evaluation of whether the DOE’s research and development and performance confirmation programs, as well as other administrative controls and systems, meet applicable NRC requirements. Volume 4 contains the staff’s finding that most administrative and programmatic requirements in NRC regulations are met, except for certain requirements relating to ownership of land and water rights. Publication of Volumes 3 and 4 does not signal whether or when the NRC might authorize construction of the repository.
All spent nuclear fuel from PVNGS is being stored on-site. PVNGS has sufficient capacity at its on-site ISFSI to store all of the nuclear fuel that will be irradiated during the initial operating license periods, which end in November 2027. Additionally, PVNGS has sufficient capacity at its on-site ISFSI to store a portion of the fuel that will be irradiated during the extended license periods, which end in November 2047. If uncertainties regarding the United States government’s obligation to accept and store spent fuel are not favorably resolved, the PVNGS participants will evaluate alternative storage solutions. These may obviate the need to expand the ISFSI to accommodate all of the fuel that will be irradiated during the extended license periods. 
Water Supply
See Note 16 for information about PNM’s water supply.
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
Electric utilities are subject to stringent laws and regulations for protection of the environment by local, state, federal, and tribal authorities. In addition, PVNGS is subject to the jurisdiction of the NRC, which has the authority to issue permits and licenses and to regulate nuclear facilities in order to protect the health and safety of the public from radioactive hazards and to conduct environmental reviews. The liabilities under these laws and regulations can be material. In some instances, liabilities may be imposed without regard to fault, or may be imposed for past acts, whether or not such acts were lawful at the time they occurred. The construction expenditure projection (Note 14) includes the environmental upgrades at Four Corners discussed in Note 16, which aggregate $35.1 million in 2017 and $9.0 million in 2018. See MD&A – Other Issues Facing the Company – Climate Change Issues for information on GHG.

COMPETITION
Regulated utilities are generally not subject to competition from other utilities in areas that are under the jurisdiction of state regulatory commissions. In New Mexico, PNM does not have direct competition for services provided to its retail electric customers. In Texas, TNMP is not currently in any direct retail competition with any other regulated electric utility. However, 
A - 10

PNM and TNMP are subject to customer conservation and energy efficiency activities as well as initiatives to utilize alternative energy sources, including self-generation, or otherwise bypass the PNM and TNMP systems. 
PNM is subject to varying degrees of competition in certain territories adjacent to or within the areas it serves. This competition comes from other utilities in its region as well as rural electric cooperatives and municipal utilities.  PNM is involved in the generation and sale of electricity into the wholesale market although PNM has decided to stop pursuing wholesale generation contracts.  PNM is subject to competition from regional utilities and merchant power suppliers with similar opportunities to generate and sell energy at market-based prices and larger trading entities that do not own or operate generating assets.
