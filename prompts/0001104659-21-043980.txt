ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
 
Purpose of the Trust. Kiewit Royalty Trust (the "Trust") was organized by Peter Kiewit Sons', Inc. (now, known as Level 3 Communications, Inc.) (the "Trustor") under the laws of the State of Nebraska on May 17, 1982 to provide an efficient, orderly and practical means of administrating the income received from three royalty interests and sixteen overriding royalty interests in leases of four coal mines located in the States of Montana and Wyoming (the "Coal Royalties"). The trustee of the Trust is U.S. Bank National Association, Omaha, Nebraska (the "Trustee"), which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of U.S. Bancorp, a bank holding company. The Coal Royalties are the interests retained in the four mine properties under the leases of the mineral rights to the mining companies who have developed, mined, and sold the coal from these mines. In general, the Coal Royalties entitle the Trust to a specified portion of the value of the total coal production from these mines, free of the expense of development and operation.
 
The Coal Royalties were conveyed by the Trustor to the Trust for the benefit of the holders of record of the Trustor's Class B and Class C common stock as of June 10, 1982. Ownership of beneficial interests in the Trust is represented by 12,633,432 units of beneficial interest (hereinafter referred to as "Units"). The Trust is a purely ministerial trust which generally distributes the available revenues generated by the Coal Royalties, net of the Trust's expenses, to the holders of Units. Trust expenses include but are not limited to, fees of the Trustee, and compensation paid to geologists, engineers, accountants, attorneys, or other professionals that the Trustee may, in its discretion, employ in the administration of the Trust. With respect to any liability that is contingent or uncertain in amount or that otherwise is not currently due, the Trustee has the discretion to establish cash reserves for the payment thereof.
 
The Coal Royalties. The Coal Royalties provide for the payment of either a specified amount per ton of coal produced, or a fixed percentage of the value or price with respect to the coal produced under the leases relating to these interests. The remaining terms of the individual Coal Royalties vary considerably, as does the acreage covered by the underlying coal leases, the estimated total tons of coal within a legal description of property as evidenced by a lease (the "Tons Under Lease") and the estimated total tons of coal under lease that can be economically extracted under existing market conditions ("Current Economic Tons"). In general, the Current Economic Tons will be less than the total Tons Under Lease because the cost of extracting a portion of the total Tons Under Lease will outweigh the price at which the coal could be sold. In addition, Current Economic Tons may be reduced by the refusal of a state and/or federal authority to grant a permit to mine portions of the coal reserves within a specific property. The inability to extract the total Tons Under Lease or the inability to sell any portion of the coal extracted will reduce the royalties payable to the Trust.
 
The following chart sets forth the actual total amount of coal production for which royalties were earned during the past two years at the Decker and Spring Creek mines:

The following sets forth certain information about each of the mine properties in which the Trust continues to hold a Coal Royalty:
 
DECKER MINE. The Decker coal mine is in the northwest of the Powder River Basin, which is located in Big Horn County, Montana, approximately 20 miles north of Sheridan, Wyoming. The Decker Mine is solely owned and operated by Lighthouse Resources Inc. (formerly known as Ambre Energy North America, Inc.) and has been since 2014. Also in 2014, signaling its focus on projects in the United States, Ambre Energy North America, Inc. separated from its Australian parent company, Ambre Energy Limited, when longtime investor Resource Capital Funds became the majority owner of Ambre Energy North America, Inc. Lighthouse Resources Inc. is privately held and headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah. The Decker Mine in its entirety includes approximately 23,000 acres. The Trust owns overriding royalty interests in six leases at the Decker Mine. The terms of the Trust's overriding royalty interests of each lease as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, are set forth in the table below, of which the accompanying notes are an integral part:

1 The Trust has an undivided one-half interest in a second overriding royalty pertaining to each of these leases. By the terms of the assignment by which it was created, this second overriding royalty, when added to all other royalties pertaining to each of these leases, may not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the royalty paid to the lessor under each of these leases.

2 The operator of this lease has indicated that it expects mining to continue.

3 Although there is no current mining on this lease, the operator of this lease has indicated that it is still active and continues to renew it annually. Currently, little or no mining activity is expected in the future.
 
Lighthouse Resources, Inc., the owner of the Decker Mine, filed for bankruptcy in December 2020, and announced that it would be substantially reducing its workforce at the Decker Mine. Due to the pending bankruptcy case, the status of the Trustâ€™s royalty interests is currently unknown. The Trust is, and intends to continue, monitoring the bankruptcy filings, but at this time, it is unknown whether the Trust will receive additional royalties from this mine in the future due to various factors, including the recent bankruptcy filing, the financial struggles of the coal operator, the cessation of mining activities in the applicable mines, and the reduced demand for coal.
 
SPRING CREEK MINE. Spring Creek Coal Company ("Spring Creek") operates this mine, which is located in Big Horn County, Montana, approximately 25 miles north of Sheridan, Wyoming and owned by Cloud Peak Energy. The Spring Creek Mine in its entirety includes approximately 2,560 acres. The Trust owns an overriding royalty interest in one lease at the Spring Creek Mine. The terms of the overriding royalty interest of the lease as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, are set forth in the table below, of which the accompanying notes are an integral part:
 

Lease Number | Lessor | Terms of Overriding Royalties(4) | | | Tons of Coal Produced In 2020 | | Tons of Coal Produced In 2019 
-------------+---------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------+---+-----------------------------------+---+----------------------------------
M-069782(5) | United States | | 10.75 | % | | - | | -

 

4 Under the terms of the lease, the Trust receives a royalty payment equivalent to 10.75% of the applicable production royalties paid to the United States. The royalties paid to the United States are based on sales and fluctuate based on the value of coal.

5 The operator of this lease has indicated that the mine is being depleted. Production for this mine is expected to be nominal.
 
It is unknown whether the Trust will receive additional royalties from this mine in the future due to various factors, including the financial struggles of the coal operator, the lack of mining activities in the applicable mines, and the general depletion of coal. Further, the Spring Creek Mine temporarily laid-off workers in Spring 2020 due to the lack of coal demand, resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, and while it rehired the workers, it remains unknown if mining will continue. In addition to its interests in the foregoing leases, the Trust has overriding royalty interests in other leases from which no production is currently contemplated and/or which are considered to be not mineable because of access, alluvial valley, or other problems.
