OVERVIEW
 We are a clinical-stage immunotherapy company focused on leveraging the power of the body’s innate and adaptive immune responses through toll-like receptor (“TLR”) stimulation. Our current product candidates are being investigated for use in multiple cancer indications, as a vaccine for the prevention of hepatitis B and as a disease modifying therapy for asthma.
 our technology
 Toll-like Receptor Immune Modulation Platform
 Toll-like receptors are a family of transmembrane proteins that play a vital role in innate immunity and subsequent adaptive immunity. Signaling through these receptors is triggered by the binding of a variety of pathogen-associated molecules and is essential to generation of innate immunity. The innate immune response is, in effect, the first line of defense against viruses, bacteria and other potential pathogens. The innate response also initiates and regulates the generation of an adaptive immune response composed of highly specific antibodies and T cells. Our research is focused primarily on stimulation of a subset of TLRs that have evolved to recognize bacterial and viral nucleic acids.
 Our research has resulted in the identification of proprietary synthetic oligonucleotides (short segments of DNA), that mimic the activity of microbial DNA and selectively activate one of these important receptors, TLR9. These are called CpG oligonucleotides – CpGs for short – referring to the presence of specific nucleotide sequences containing the CG base pair. In addition, we are developing compounds that activate two other important innate receptors, TLR7 and TLR8. These TLR agonists are able to stimulate or modify immune responses as single agents and can synergize with other classes of immunotherapeutic agents. In combination with tumor antigens or vaccines, these TLR agonists can substantially enhance and prolong protective immune responses. Thus this portfolio of novel and potent activators opens multiple opportunities for expanding the scope of cancer immunotherapy, enhancing the efficiency of vaccines and modulating allergic diseases.

Immuno-oncology
 Immuno-oncology is a rapidly advancing field that focuses on modulating the immune system to develop or enhance anti-tumor activities in order to control growth or eliminate tumors. The industry is exploring multiple strategies and technologies aimed at enhancing and prolonging anti-tumor immune responses and inhibiting the actions of multiple immune checkpoints that limit the effectiveness of anti-tumor responses. Agents that inhibit two of these immune checkpoints, CTLA-4 and the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction, have been approved for a number of cancer indications. These checkpoint inhibitors represent a major advance in cancer treatment, yet a majority of patients fail to respond to these inhibitors used as single agents. In many instances, it appears that the failure to respond correlates with anti-tumor activity that remains inadequate even with checkpoint blockade. Thus, a major opportunity in immuno-oncology is the development of immunostimulatory approaches that increase the number, location and functional state of tumor-reactive cytotoxic T cells, enabling remission and durable control of tumor growth.
 Through our expertise in TLR biology we have designed compounds that stimulate multiple innate mechanisms, activating a cascade of anti-tumor activities including stimulating the tumor microenvironment, generating tumor specific T cells and initiating a systemic distribution of those cells to all tumor sites. These compounds were specifically designed to stimulate multiple pathways of tumor killing through type 1 interferon induction and highly efficient stimulation of antigen presenting functions of plasmacytoid dendritic cells.
 Our clinical development strategy for immuno-oncology applications is based on two key principles. The first is that immune activation by TLR agonists will be significantly more effective when focused on the tumor than when administered as a systemic therapy. This has been shown in many studies with mouse tumor models and has been confirmed in pioneering academic studies of intratumoral injection of CpGs in lymphoma patients. These studies indicate TLR9 stimulation applied locally allows optimal concentrations of the CpG to be achieved at the site of highest concentrations of tumor antigens and T cells that recognize those antigens. Local stimulation of innate anti-tumor mechanisms, such as Natural Killer cells, should enhance release of tumor antigens and locally induced chemokine gradients can lead to enhanced recruitment of additional tumor-reactive T cells.
 The second principle is the development of combinations that have complementary mechanisms of action and have the potential for synergistic, rather than additive clinical effects. An example is our development of combination treatment of intra-tumoral SD-101 with the PD-1 inhibitor, pembrolizumab. Pembrolizumab releases anti-tumor T cells from one of the most potent of the immune checkpoints, while intratumoral SD-101 generates both greater numbers and more highly functional cytotoxic T cells directed against tumor cells. We have published studies showing the mechanisms of this synergy in mouse tumor models.

We are developing our initial immuno-oncology product candidate, SD-101, to eventually be combined with a variety of immunotherapies when activation of an anti-tumor immune response is desirable. We are targeting combinations with checkpoint inhibitors that offer activities synergistic with TLR 9 stimulation, with an initial focus on approved checkpoint inhibitors in indications that have generally low response rates and would provide a clear path to approval. As a result we began our first combination trial in metastatic melanoma with SD-101, our novel intratumoral TLR9 agonist, in combination with KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab), an anti-PD1 therapy approved for metastatic melanoma, under a clinical collaboration with Merck & Co. We have expanded this trial to include head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, another approved indication for KEYTRUDA. In addition, under this clinical collaboration, Merck is conducting a Phase 1 trial in multiple malignancies with SD-101 in combination with their investigational anti-IL10 compound. 
 Additionally there are ongoing and planned investigator sponsored studies to support our strategy to develop SD-101 in combination with multiple checkpoint inhibitors and other agents in multiple indications. 
 SD-101 – TLR9 Agonist for intratumoral injection
 Our lead cancer immunotherapy candidate is SD-101, a C Class CpG TLR9 agonist that was selected for characteristics optimal for treatment of cancer, including high interferon induction. Directly injecting SD-101 into a tumor site optimizes its effect by ensuring proximity to tumor-specific antigens. In animal models, SD-101 demonstrated significant anti-tumor effects at both the injected site and at distant sites. We are conducting a clinical program intended to assess potential efficacy of SD-101 in a range of tumors and in combination with a range of treatments, including checkpoint inhibitors and other therapies. 
 In October 2014, we initiated a Phase 1/2 multicenter clinical trial of intratumoral administration of SD-101 in adults with untreated low-grade B-cell lymphoma. Key objectives of this study were to assess the systemic, or abscopal, effect on non-injected lesions and to measure levels of CD8+ T cells in the injected site.  In December of 2016 we reported interim clinical data from 28 evaluable patients demonstrating tumor regression in untreated tumor sites in a majority of the patients and increases in CD8+ cells were observed in the injected tumor, which correlated with abscopal tumor shrinkage.
 SD-101 in combination with KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) in Melanoma
 In October 2015, we initiated a Phase 1/2 multicenter clinical trial to assess the safety and potential efficacy of intratumoral SD-101 in combination with Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab), in patients with advanced or metastatic melanoma. The study includes patients who have disease that is progressing while receiving an anti-PD-1 therapy and patients who are naïve to anti-PD-1 therapy.
 In March 2017, we reported results from the Phase 1 dose escalation part of the study, evaluating 17 patients for efficacy and 22 patients for safety. In patients naïve to anti-PD-1 treatment, responses were observed in six out of seven patients, for an overall response rate of 86%. This includes two (29%) complete responses and four (57%) partial responses. Target tumor shrinkage was observed in all 7 evaluable patients. In 10 patients with progressive disease who initiated KEYTRUDA anti-PD-1 monotherapy prior to enrollment, one partial response was observed and five patients had stable disease while receiving KEYTRUDA and SD-101, with four of the 10 patients experiencing target tumor shrinkage. In early 2017 we completed the initial dose escalation phase and have begun the expansion phase of the trial. In this expansion phase patients will be stratified into two groups, anti-PD1 therapy naïve patients and patients with progressive disease while on anti-PD1 therapy.
 SD-101 in combination with KEYTRUDA generally was well-tolerated. No dose-limiting toxicities of the combination were observed in any dose cohort, and a maximum tolerated dose was not identified. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were injection site reactions and transient grade 1 to 2 flu-like symptoms, including fever, chills and myalgia that respond to over the counter medications such as acetaminophen. The study also includes biomarker assessments, suggesting that treatment with SD-101 and KEYTRUDA resulted in elevation of gene signatures consistent with an increase in Th1 immune cell types as well as an increase in immune cell infiltrates such as CD8+ T-cells in the tumor microenvironment.
 SD-101 in combination with KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma
 Based on the initial results from the combination of SD-101 and KEYTRUDA in melanoma, we have expanded the combination study with KEYTRUDA to include a Phase 2 trial in patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell cancers. 
 SD-101 in combination with MK-1966 (monoclonal antibody against IL-10)
 Under our clinical collaboration, Merck has initiated a Phase 1 dose ranging study combining their monoclonal antibody against IL10 with SD-101.

DV281 – Inhaled TLR 9 agonist for lung cancer
 We pioneered the development of an inhaled TLR9 agonist for asthma. The lead product candidate, AZD1419, was developed under a collaboration with AstraZeneca and is currently being evaluated by AstraZeneca in a phase 2 clinical trial in asthma patients.  Based on this experience and our SD-101 research, we are developing a TLR9 agonist, DV281, designed for delivery to lung cancer patients as an inhaled aerosol. 
 Although we continue to advance the strategy of focused delivery of a CpG in studies with intratumoral injection of SD-101, there are many tumor types for which direct, repeated injection is not feasible. Non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”) represents one such challenge. This major type of lung cancer is known to respond to a variety of immunotherapy approaches and several inhibitors of the PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint pathway have been approved for NSCLC. Yet response rates to these agents remain low. A strategy for focused delivery to lung tumors is direct administration to the lung by inhalation. To accomplish this, we have developed DV281, a novel investigational TLR9 agonist designed specifically for focused delivery to primary lung tumors and lung metastases.  DV281 is similar in biological activity and mechanism of action to SD-101, but has been optimized for administration as an aerosol. 
 Studies in preclinical animal models of lung cancer show that this direct delivery of DV281 to tumor-bearing lungs results in induction of interferons and cytokines and infiltration of T cells, responses similar to those observed after intratumoral injection of SD-101. Animal models also demonstrate synergy of inhaled DV281 with anti-PD1 antibodies in reducing tumor burden and generating a systemic and durable anti-tumor response. Inhaled DV281, delivered by a nebulizer, is planned to enter clinical trials for NSCLC, in combination with anti-PD-1 therapy, in the second quarter of 2017. 
 Vaccine Adjuvants
 Our vaccine research to date has focused on the use of TLR9 agonists as novel adjuvants. Different TLR9 agonist molecules are taken up within different endosomes within target cells, stimulating different signaling pathways. CpG B-Class TLR9 agonists, such as our 1018 vaccine adjuvant, are selectively taken up by late endosomes (more mature endosomes also known as multivesicular bodies), resulting in signaling that leads to release of cytokines necessary for T cell activation and establishing long-term immunity but with modest induction of interferon alpha. TLR9 stimulation also helps generate memory T Helper 1 (“Th1”) cells that can stimulate the immune system to induce long-lasting effects. As a result, TLR9 adjuvanted vaccines induce a specific Th1 immune response and durable levels of protective antibodies.
HEPLISAV-B
 Our most advanced product candidate is HEPLISAV-B, an investigational adult hepatitis B vaccine. HEPLISAV-B combines 1018, a proprietary TLR9 agonist adjuvant, and recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen (“rHBsAg” or “HBsAg”) that is manufactured by Dynavax GmbH, our wholly-owned subsidiary in Düsseldorf, Germany. In Phase 3 trials, HEPLISAV-B demonstrated earlier protection with fewer doses than a currently approved hepatitis B vaccine and a similar adverse event profile. Our original Biologics License Application (BLA) was submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in April 2012.  FDA issued a Complete Response Letter (CRL) to Dynavax in February 2013 requesting an additional clinical trial to increase the safety database. 
 In March 2016, we resubmitted the BLA for HEPLISAV-B to the FDA to add more than 5,000 subjects to the HEPLSIAV-B safety database. The total safety database for HEPLISAV-B currently includes 10,038 participants. The FDA issued a CRL to Dynavax in November 2016 requesting information regarding several topics, including clarification of specific adverse events of special interest (AESIs), a numerical imbalance in a small number of cardiac events in a single study, new analyses of the integrated safety data base across different time periods, and post-marketing commitments. We resubmitted the BLA in February 2017 and the FDA has established August 10, 2017 as the Prescription Drug User Fee Act action date. 
 In order to maintain the ability to pursue HEPLISAV-B through the review period we enacted a restructuring plan to suspend manufacturing activities, commercial preparations and other longer term investment related to HEPLISAV-B. If the product is approved, we plan to use existing stockpiled inventory to support initial sales.
 HEPLISAV-B Potential Commercial Opportunity
 Dynavax has worldwide commercial rights to HEPLISAV-B. Our only pending request for regulatory approval is in the U.S., so our initial commercialization efforts will be in the U.S.. There are three approved hepatitis B vaccines in the U.S.: Engerix-B and Twinrix® from GlaxoSmithKline plc (“GSK”) and Recombivax-HB® from Merck & Co. (“Merck”). Key market segments for these products consist of persons considered to be at high risk for hepatitis B virus (“HBV”) infection and include people with multiple sexual partners or injection drug use, healthcare workers and first responders, international travelers, chronic liver disease patients and, in the U.S., people with diabetes mellitus (type 1 and type 2).
 6

Currently, the U.S. market for adult hepatitis B vaccines is approximately $270 million annually. In late 2012 the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (“ACIP”) expanded its recommendation for adults who should be vaccinated against hepatitis B to include people with diabetes mellitus (type 1 and type 2). According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) there are 20 million adults diagnosed with diabetes and another 1.5 million new cases diagnosed each year. This population represented a significant increase in the number of adults recommended for vaccination against hepatitis B in the U.S. 
 Autoimmune and Inflammatory Diseases
 We also have clinical and preclinical programs focused on therapeutics for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.
 AZD1419 for Asthma 
 AZD1419 is being developed for the treatment of asthma pursuant to a collaboration with AstraZeneca AB (“AstraZeneca”). AZD1419 is designed to change the basic immune response to environmental allergens, such as house dust and pollens, leading to prolonged reduction in asthma symptoms by converting the response from one primarily mediated by type-2 helper T cells to type-1 helper T cells.
 A Phase 1a study of AZD1419 demonstrated its safety and tolerability in healthy subjects. The study also produced dose-dependent induction of genes by endogenous interferon, as measured in sputum, indicating presence of the drug at the target site and expected activity. On the basis of those results, the parties agreed to bypass a planned Phase 1b trial and proceed directly to Phase 2. AstraZeneca initiated a Phase 2 trial in asthma patient during 2016, which AstraZeneca will fully fund and conduct.  
 Under our September 2006 Research Collaboration and License Agreement with AstraZeneca, as amended, remaining potential milestone payments to us total approximately $100 million based on the achievement of certain development and regulatory objectives. In addition, upon commercialization, we are eligible to receive tiered royalties ranging from the mid to high single-digits based on product sales of any products originating from the collaboration. We have the option to co-promote in the United States products arising from the collaboration, if any. AstraZeneca has the right to sublicense its rights upon our prior consent.
 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 
 Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our drug candidates, technology and know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. In addition to seeking patent protection in the U.S., we generally file patent applications in Australia, Canada, Europe, Japan and additional foreign countries on a selective basis to further protect the inventions that we or our partners consider important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets and contracts to protect our proprietary information. 
 As of December 31, 2016, our intellectual property portfolio included over 30 issued U.S. patents, over 260 issued or granted foreign patents and over 40 additional pending U.S. and foreign patent applications claiming compositions containing TLR agonists or antagonists, methods of use, and/or methods of manufacture thereof.
 We have an issued U.S. patent covering the TLR agonist contained in our HEPLISAV-B investigational vaccine that will expire in 2018, and have corresponding issued patents in several major European and other countries. We have issued patents expiring in 2023 and covering compositions such as SD-101 and their uses in the U.S. and in several major European and other countries. We own or have an exclusive license to U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications pending for each of our other product candidates and/or their uses. At present, it is not known or determinable whether patents will issue from any of these applications or what the specific expiration dates would be for any patents that do issue. 
 Individual patents extend for varying periods depending on the date of filing of the patent application or the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued in the U.S. are effective for: 
  
• | the longer of 17 years from the issue date or 20 years from the earliest effective filing date, if the patent application was filed prior to June 8, 1995; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 20 years from the earliest effective filing date, if the patent application was filed on or after June 8, 1995.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. The duration of patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is 20 years from the filing date. Our patent estate, based on patents existing now and expected by us to issue based on pending applications, will expire on dates ranging from 2017 to 2036.
 7

The actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patents. 
 Because patent applications in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions typically are not published until 18 months after filing and publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions claimed in each of our issued patents or pending patent applications or that we were the first to invent and/or the first to file for protection of the inventions set forth in these patent applications. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“PTO”) may declare interference proceedings to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patent applications and those of other parties or reexamination or reissue proceedings to determine if the scope of a patent should be narrowed. 
 Our commercial success depends significantly on our ability to operate without infringing patents and proprietary rights of third parties. A number of pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies, including Pfizer, Inc. (“Pfizer”), as well as universities and research institutions, may have filed patent applications or may have been granted patents that cover inventions similar to the inventions owned or licensed to us. We cannot determine with certainty whether patents or patent applications of other parties may materially affect our ability to make, use or sell any products. If another party controls patents or patent applications covering our products, we may not be able to obtain the rights we need to those patents or patent applications in order to commercialize our products. Two of our potential competitors, Merck and GSK, are exclusive licensees of broad patents covering HBsAg, a component of HEPLISAV-B. In addition, the Institut Pasteur owns or has exclusive licenses to patents covering HBsAg. While some of these patents have expired or will soon expire outside the U.S., they remain in force in the U.S. In order to commercialize HEPLISAV-B, we may be involved in litigation or licensing in respect of some or all of these patents. To the extent we are able to commercialize HEPLISAV-B in the U.S. while these patents remain in force, Merck, GSK, their licensors or the Institut Pasteur may bring claims against us.
 Litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued or licensed to us or to determine the scope or validity of another party’s proprietary rights. The existence of third-party patent applications and patents could significantly reduce the coverage of the patents owned by or licensed to us and limit our ability to obtain meaningful patent protection. For example, Pfizer has issued U.S. and foreign patent claims as well as patent claims pending with the PTO and foreign patent offices that, if held to be valid, could require us to obtain a license in order to commercialize one or more of our formulations of TLR agonist other than with respect to HEPLISAV-B, for which we have a license. Litigation or any other proceedings, such as patent interferences, could result in substantial costs to and diversion of effort by us, and an adverse outcome in a court or patent office could subject us to significant liabilities, require disputed rights to be licensed from other parties, or require us to cease using some of our technology. We may not prevail in these actions or proceedings, if any. 
 In addition, other parties may duplicate, design around or independently develop similar or alternative technologies to ours or our licensors. 
 We may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets and confidentiality agreements to protect our technology. Although trade secrets are difficult to protect, wherever possible, we use confidential disclosure agreements to protect the proprietary nature of our technology. Our policy is to require each of our commercial partners, employees, consultants and advisors to enter into an agreement before beginning their employment, consulting or advisory relationship with us that in general provides that the individuals must keep confidential and not disclose to other parties any of our confidential information developed or learned by the individuals during the course of their relationship with us except in limited circumstances. These agreements also generally provide that we own all inventions conceived by the individuals in the course of rendering their employment or services to us. However, there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets and/or proprietary information will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our employees, consultants or contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may also arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. 
 COMPETITION 
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. Our products and development programs target a number of areas, including vaccine adjuvants, cancer immunotherapy and autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. There are many commercially available products for the prevention and treatment of these diseases. Many companies and institutions are making substantial investments in developing additional products to treat these diseases that could compete directly or indirectly with our products under development. 
 8

Our cancer immunotherapy, SD-101, if developed, approved and commercialized will compete with a range of therapies being used or studied to treat blood cancers and solid tumor malignancies, including:
  
• | Chemotherapeutic agents;
--+-------------------------


• | Immuno-oncology agents, including immune checkpoint inhibitors such as anti- CTLA4 and anti-PD1 antibodies, immune stimulation therapies including agonists of TLR and other innate immune recognition receptors; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Targeted therapies, such as BRAF inhibitors and MEK inhibitors.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------

 Approved and late-stage investigational cancer immunotherapeutics are marketed or being developed by numerous companies, including AstraZeneca/MedImmune, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Celgene, Gilead, Roche/Genentech, and Merck.
 We are in direct competition with a number of other companies developing TLR agonist as well as other mechanisms of action that are focused on stimulating the immune response. These companies include Aduro Biotech, Inc., Idera Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Immune Design Corp. and Checkmate Pharmaceuticals, Inc..
 HEPLISAV-B, a two-dose hepatitis B vaccine, if approved and commercialized, will compete directly with conventional three-dose marketed vaccines Engerix-B from GSK as well as Recombivax-HB marketed by Merck, among others. There are also modified schedules of conventional hepatitis B vaccines for limited age ranges that are approved in the European Union and U.S. In addition, HEPLISAV-B will compete against Twinrix, a multivalent vaccine marketed by GSK for protection against hepatitis B and hepatitis A. 
 Our asthma therapy, AZD1419, if developed, approved and commercialized, will compete indirectly with existing asthma therapies, such as inhaled beta-agonists, corticosteroids, leukotriene inhibitors and IgE monoclonal antibodies, including those marketed by Merck, Roche/Genentech, Novartis International AG, AstraZeneca and GSK. 
 Many of the entities developing and marketing these competing products have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing than we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative agreements with large, established companies with access to capital. These entities may also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to or necessary for our programs. 
 REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS 
 In the U.S., pharmaceutical and biological products are subject to rigorous review and approval by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act and other federal statutes and regulations. In Europe, under the centralized procedure, a company submits a single application to the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”). The steps ordinarily required by the regulatory authorities before a new drug or biological product may be marketed in the U.S. and in most other countries include but are not limited to the following: 

• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, preclinical studies and formulation studies;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the regulatory authority of a clinical application for a new drug or biologic which must become effective before clinical trials may begin;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug or biologic for each proposed indication;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | demonstration of the consistent manufacturing of drug substance and drug product;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the submission of a new drug application to the regulatory authority; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | regulatory review and approval of the application before any commercial marketing, sale or shipment of the drug or biologic.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 If applicable requirements are not met, regulatory authorities may issue fines, require that a company recall its products, seize products, require that a company totally or partially suspend the production of its products, refuse to approve a marketing application, pursue criminal prosecution and/or revoke previously granted marketing authorizations. 
 
9

To secure regulatory authority approval, we must submit extensive non-clinical and clinical data, adequate evidence of a product manufactured by a well-controlled process that is safe and effective for its intended use, and other supporting information to the regulatory authority. The number of preclinical studies and clinical trials that will be required for FDA and foreign regulatory agency approvals varies depending on the product candidate, the disease or condition for which the product candidate is in development and regulations applicable to any particular drug candidate. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities are susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval or clearance. Further, the results from preclinical testing and early clinical trials may not be predictive of results obtained in later clinical trials. In addition, the development of the drug substance and drug product may require manufacturing modifications to ensure future regulatory acceptance. The approval process takes many years, requires the expenditures of substantial resources, and involves post-marketing surveillance. 
 Delays experienced during the approval process may materially reduce the period during which we will have exclusive rights to exploit patented products or technologies. Delays can occur at any stage of drug development and as a result of many factors, certain of which are not under our control, including but not limited to the following: 
  
• | lack of efficacy, or incomplete or inconclusive results from clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | unforeseen safety issues;
--+--------------------------


• | failure by investigators to adhere to protocol requirements, including patient enrollment criteria;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | slower than expected rate of patient recruitment;
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | failure by subjects to comply with trial protocol requirements;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


• | inability to follow patients adequately after treatment;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | inability to qualify and enter into arrangements with third parties to manufacture sufficient quality and quantities of materials for use in clinical trials;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | failure by a contract research organization to fulfill contractual obligations; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | adverse changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development or the period of review of any application for regulatory approval or clearance.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA or foreign regulatory agency may also require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the effects of approved products or place conditions on any approvals that could restrict the commercial applications of these products. Following approval, we may be required to conduct additional post-marketing studies. The regulatory authority may withdraw product approvals if we do not continue to comply with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing. 
 Non-clinical studies involve laboratory evaluation of product characteristics or animal studies to assess the initial efficacy and safety of the product. The FDA or other foreign regulatory agency, under its good laboratory practices regulations, regulates certain non-clinical studies. Research and preclinical studies do not involve the introduction of a product candidate in human subjects. These activities involve identification of potential product candidates, modification of promising candidates to optimize their biological activity, as well as preclinical studies to assess safety and effectiveness in animals. In clinical trials, the product candidate is administered to humans. Violations of these regulations can, in some cases, lead to invalidation of those studies, requiring these studies to be repeated. The results of these tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the regulatory authority as part of a clinical application, which must be approved by the regulatory authority before we can commence clinical investigations in humans. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to humans under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator. We must conduct our clinical trials in accordance with current Good Clinical Practices (“GCP”) regulations under protocols submitted to applicable regulatory authorities as part of the clinical application. GCP regulations mandate comprehensive documentation for the clinical protocol, record keeping, training, and facilities including computers. Quality assurance and inspections are designed to ensure that these GCP standards are achieved. Additionally, each clinical trial must be approved and conducted under the auspices of an Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) or Independent Ethics Committee and with patient informed consent. The IRB will consider, among other matters, ethical factors, the safety of human subjects and the possibility of liability of the institution conducting the trial. 
 
10

The stages of the regulatory process include clinical trials in three sequential phases that may overlap. Phase 1 clinical trials typically involve the administration of a product candidate into a small group of healthy human subjects. These trials are the first attempt to evaluate a drug’s safety, determine a safe dose range and identify side effects. During Phase 2 trials, the product candidate is introduced into patients who suffer from the medical condition that the product candidate is intended to treat. Phase 2 studies are designed to evaluate whether a product candidate shows evidence of effectiveness, to further evaluate dosage, and to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks. When Phase 2 evaluations demonstrate that a product candidate appears to be both safe and effective, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to confirm a product candidate’s effectiveness and to test for safety in an expanded patient population. If the results of Phase 3 trials appear to confirm effectiveness and safety, the data gathered in all phases of clinical trials form the basis for an application for regulatory approval of the product candidate. 
 We and all of our contract manufacturers are required to comply with the applicable FDA or foreign regulatory agency current Good Manufacturing Practices (“GMP”) regulations. Manufacturers of biologics also must comply with a regulatory authority’s general biological product standards. Failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements subjects the manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product or voluntary recall of a product. Good manufacturing practice regulations require quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Before granting product approval, the regulatory authority must determine that our or our third party contractor’s manufacturing facilities meet GMP requirements before we can use them in the commercial manufacture of our products. In addition, our facilities are subject to periodic inspections by the regulatory authority for continued compliance with GMP requirements during clinical development as well as following product approval. Adverse experiences with the product must be reported to the FDA or foreign regulatory agency and could result in the imposition of market restriction through labeling changes or in product removal. 
 If our products are approved for sale, we will be subject to further regulatory requirements under federal and state provisions such as federal “sunshine” laws, anti-kickback laws, false claims laws and state law equivalents of those and other regulations. We are also subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices, the experimental use of animals and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents, used in connection with our research. We cannot accurately predict the extent of government regulation that might result from any future legislation or administrative action. 
 MANUFACTURING
 We rely on our facility in Düsseldorf, Germany and third parties to perform the multiple processes involved in manufacturing our product candidates, including the manufacturing of TLR agonists, antigens, and the formulation, fill and finish of the resultant products. We have relied on a limited number of suppliers to produce products for clinical trials and a single supplier to produce our 1018 for HEPLISAV-B. In order to successfully manufacture and commercialize HEPLISAV-B, if approved, we have secured long term supply agreements with the key third party suppliers and vendors for supply of product for commercialization. To date, we have manufactured only small quantities of TLR agonists ourselves for development purposes. We currently manufacture the HBsAg for HEPLISAV-B at our Dynavax GmbH facility. 
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 
 Conducting a significant amount of research and development has been central to our business model. Our research and development expenses were $84.5 million, $86.9 million and $84.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
ENVIRONMENT
 We have made, and will continue to make, expenditures for environmental compliance and protection. We do not expect that expenditures for compliance with environmental laws will have a material effect on our results of operations in the future. 
EMPLOYEES 
 As of December 31, 2016, we had 251 full-time employees, including 142 employees in our headquarters in Berkeley, California and 109 employees in our office and manufacturing facility in Düsseldorf, Germany. As of February 28, 2017, we had 196 employees, including 97 full-time employees in Berkeley, California and 99 employees in Düsseldorf, Germany, many of whom are part-time due to a furlough program initiated in January 2017.
