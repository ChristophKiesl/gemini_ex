ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
COMPANY OVERVIEW
Kforce Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Kforce”) provide professional staffing services and solutions to our clients on both a temporary (“Flex”) and permanent (“Direct Hire”) basis through our Technology (“Tech”) and Finance and Accounting (“FA”) segments. While our workforce has been working remotely since March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our physical worksites include our corporate headquarters in Tampa, Florida and approximately 40 field offices located throughout the U.S. Kforce was incorporated in 1994 and completed its Initial Public Offering in August 1995, but its predecessor companies have been providing staffing services since 1962.
Kforce serves clients across many industries and geographies as well as organizations of all sizes, with a particular focus on serving Fortune 1000 and other large companies. We believe that our portfolio of service offerings is a key contributor to our long-term financial stability. Our 10 largest clients represented approximately 28% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Our efforts to strategically position Kforce as a professional and technical services company has resulted in several divestitures over the last 10 years. Most recently, during 2019, Kforce sold its Government Solutions ("GS") segment, which has been reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements. Except as specifically noted, our discussions in this report exclude any activity related to the GS segment. Refer to Note 2 - “Discontinued Operations” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report, for a more detailed discussion.
Our quarterly operating results can be affected by:
•the number of billing days in a particular quarter;
•the seasonality of our clients’ businesses;
•increased holidays and vacation days taken, which is usually highest in the fourth quarter of each calendar year; and
•increased costs as a result of certain annual U.S. state and federal employment tax resets that occur at the beginning of each calendar year, which negatively impacts our gross profit and overall profitability in the first fiscal quarter of each calendar year.
Tech Segment
Our largest segment, Tech, provides both Flex and Direct Hire services to our clients, focusing primarily on areas of information technology such as systems/applications architecture and development, data management, business and artificial intelligence, machine learning and network architecture and security. One of our strategies over the last several years has been to invest in our managed teams and solutions capabilities in order to provide a higher-value, differentiated offering to our clients. Kforce has been successfully winning these more complex technology projects due to, we believe, the strong long-standing partnerships we have built with our clients and our reputation for delivering quality services. Within our Tech segment, we provide services to clients in a variety of industries with a diversified footprint in, among others, financial and business services, communications and technology. Revenue for our Tech segment decreased 0.8% to $1.0 billion in 2020 on a year-over-year basis. The average bill rate for Tech Flex in 2020 was approximately $79 per hour, which increased 4.3%, as compared to 2019. Our average assignment duration for Tech Flex is nearly 10 months, which has steadily increased over the last several years. Tech Flex continues to benefit from improving bill rates and longer assignment durations, which we believe is related to the acute labor shortage, particularly the shortage of labor for highly-skilled positions. In addition to our capability to source highly qualified U.S. domestic technology talent, we believe an important differentiator in a candidate-constrained environment is our capability to source highly qualified foreign-born talent working domestically in the U.S. in higher-end technology roles. We operate this capability on a centralized basis, which allows us to operate consistently with a keen focus on ensuring compliance in this highly regulated space.
The September 2020 report published by Staffing Industry Analysts (“SIA”) stated that temporary technology staffing is expected to experience growth of 7% in 2021. Digital transformation, as a general trend, is driving organizations across all industries to increase their technology investments as competition and the speed of change intensifies. Nontraditional competitors are also entering new emerging technologies and markets. This development puts increased pressure on companies to invest in innovation and the evolution of their business models. We believe the secular drivers of technology spend generally remain intact with many companies becoming increasingly dependent on the efficiencies provided by technology and the need for innovation to support business strategies and sustain relevancy in today’s rapidly changing marketplace. At the macro level, demand is also being driven by an ever-changing and complex regulatory and employment law environment, which increases the overall cost of employment for many companies. We believe that these factors, among others, are continuing to drive companies to look to temporary staffing providers, such as Kforce, to meet their human capital needs.
We are pleased with our above-market performance in our Tech business in 2020 and remain very excited about our strategic position and ability to execute in 2021, in what we believe will be a strong demand environment for our services. 
FA Segment
Our FA segment provides both Flex and Direct Hire services to our clients in areas such as accounting, transactional finance (e.g. payables, receivables, business and cost analysis), financial analysis and reporting, taxation, budgeting, loan servicing, professional administration, audit services and systems and controls analysis and documentation. Within our FA segment, we 
provide services to clients in a variety of industries with a diversified footprint in the financial services, healthcare and manufacturing sectors. Revenue for our FA segment increased 20.2% to $348.1 million in 2020 on a year-over-year basis primarily as a result of certain contracts we secured in the second quarter to support government-sponsored COVID-19 related initiatives (the “COVID-19 Business”). These contracts contributed $114.7 million in revenue in 2020. Excluding the contribution of revenue from our COVID-19 Business, our FA segment would have decreased 19.4% on a year-over-year basis. The average bill rate for FA Flex in 2020 was approximately $34 per hour, which decreased 6.3% as compared to 2019. This decrease is primarily a result of lower pay rates on the COVID-19 Business. 
Strategically, in late 2020, we began intensifying our efforts to migrate our FA Flex business toward higher-end skill sets that are less susceptible to technological change, location and automation such as analytics and decision-support roles. This strategic effort will continue into 2021 and we expect will result in natural assignment ends of lower skilled roles where strategic client relationships do not exist. 
The September 2020 report published by SIA stated that finance and accounting temporary staffing is expected to experience growth of 12% in 2021. For Kforce, we expect overall FA revenues in 2021 to decline from 2020 levels due to expected declines in our COVID-19 Business as well as the migration of our FA Flex business. 
Flex Revenue
Flex revenue represents approximately 97% of total revenue over the last three fiscal years. We provide our clients with qualified individuals (“consultants”), or teams of consultants in the case of a project-based solution, on a temporary basis when the consultant's set of skills and experience is the right match for our clients. We utilize a diversified set of recruitment platforms and tools to identify and engage with candidates. The vast majority of our consultants are directly employed by Kforce, including domestic and foreign workers sponsored by Kforce, with a smaller composition representing qualified independent contractors. Our success is dependent upon our internal employees’ (“associates”) ability to: (1) acknowledge, understand and participate in creating solutions for our clients’ needs; (2) determine and understand the experience and capabilities of the consultants being recruited or teams of consultants being formed; (3) ensure excellence in delivering and managing the client-consultant relationship; and (4) have access to a sufficient pool of qualified consultants. We believe proper execution by our associates and consultants directly impacts the longevity of the assignments, increases the likelihood of generating repeat business with our clients and fosters a better experience for our consultants, which has a direct correlation to consultant redeployment.
The key drivers of Flex revenue are the number of consultants on assignment, billable hours, the bill rate per hour and, to a limited extent, the amount of billable expenses incurred by Kforce. Our Flex gross profit is determined by deducting related costs of employment for consultants, including compensation, payroll taxes, certain fringe benefits and independent contractor costs from Flex revenue. Associate and management commissions, compensation, payroll taxes and other fringe benefits are included in selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”), along with other customary costs such as administrative and corporate costs. 
Direct Hire Revenue
Our Direct Hire business involves locating qualified individuals (“candidates”) for permanent placement with our clients. Direct Hire revenue represents approximately 3% of total revenue over the last three fiscal years. Although it is a smaller portion of our business, it continues to be an important capability in ensuring that we have the flexibility to meet the talent needs of our clients. We recruit candidates using methods that are consistent with Flex consultants. Candidate searches are generally performed on a contingency basis (as opposed to a retained search); therefore, revenue is earned only if the candidates are ultimately hired by our clients. The typical fee structure is based upon a percentage of the candidate’s annual compensation in their first year of employment, which is determined or estimated at the time of placement. 
The key drivers of Direct Hire revenue are the number of placements and the associated placement fee. Direct Hire revenue also includes conversion revenue, which may occur when a consultant initially assigned to a client on a temporary basis is later converted to a permanent placement for a fee. Direct Hire revenue is recorded net of an allowance for “fallouts,” which occurs when a candidate does not complete the contingency period (typically 90 days or less). There are no consultant payroll costs associated with Direct Hire placements; therefore, all Direct Hire revenue increases gross profit by the full amount of the fee, which constitutes a disproportionate percentage of our gross profit. Commissions, compensation and benefits for Direct Hire associates are included in SG&A. 
Industry Overview
The professional staffing industry is made up of thousands of companies, most of which are small local firms providing limited service offerings to a relatively small local client base. A report published by SIA in 2020 indicated that, in the U.S., Kforce is one of the 15 largest publicly-traded specialty staffing firms, the fifth largest technology temporary staffing firm and the fifth largest finance and accounting temporary staffing firm.
From an economic standpoint, temporary employment figures and trends are important indicators of staffing demand, based on data published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and SIA. The penetration rate (the percentage of temporary staffing to total employment) and unemployment rate were 1.9% and 6.7%, respectively, in December 2020, down from 2.0% (penetration) and up from 3.5% (unemployment), respectively, in December 2019. Temporary help employment was down 7.6% year-over-year as of December 2020, and total non-farm employment was down 6.2% year-over-year. In addition, the college-level unemployment rate, which we believe serves as a proxy for professional employment and therefore aligns well with the consultant and candidate population that Kforce most typically serves, was 3.8% in December 2020, which represented an 
increase from December 2019. Further, we believe that the unemployment rate in the specialties we serve, especially in certain technology skill sets, is significantly lower than the published averages. We believe this speaks to the overall secular drivers of demand in technology, the critical nature of the technology initiatives being driven by our clients, as well as the challenges of finding an adequate supply of qualified talent. 
According to the September 2020 SIA report, the technology temporary staffing industry and finance and accounting temporary staffing industry are expected to generate projected revenues of $31.7 billion and $7.8 billion, respectively, in 2021. Based on these projected revenues, our current market share is approximately 3%. Our business strategies are focused on expanding our share of the U.S. temporary staffing industry and investing in our capability to provide higher level IT services and solutions. According to SIA, the addressable market in the technology solutions space was approximately $29.5 billion in 2020. 
Business Strategies
Our primary objectives are driving long-term shareholder value by achieving above-market revenue growth, making prudent investments to enhance our efficiency and effectiveness within our operating model and significantly improving levels of operating profitability. We believe the following strategies will help us achieve our objectives. 
Evolving our Managed Services and Solutions Offerings. Our clients have increasingly been looking for firms such as Kforce to assume a greater level of responsibility in assisting them with their digital transformation efforts. The total addressable market in the higher end IT services and solutions is significantly larger than in the traditional technology staff augmentation market. The use of firms such as Kforce, which can provide cost effective access to highly skilled talent, is a significant driver for this increased demand. We are leveraging the longevity of our relationships, primarily with Fortune 1000 companies, and our understanding of existing client needs to provide talent beyond traditional staff augmentation into areas including resource and capacity management as well as managed services and solutions. As an example, we have an engagement with a communications company to assist with an upgrade of its legacy infrastructure and migration to the cloud to improve its end customer’s experience. Kforce was responsible for defining the cloud strategy, from architecture to the implementation roadmap, and assisted with cloud-native development, data security, compliance and reporting. We are continuing to make significant headcount investments in defined practice areas and our delivery assurance capabilities to grow this offering organically. We also believe there may be inorganic growth opportunities to supplement our existing business. 
Further Improve the Quality of our Revenue Stream. In addition to the significant progress we have made in evolving our managed services and solutions offering, we are also focused on further improving the quality of our revenue stream through the migration of our FA business towards more highly skilled assignments in decision-support and analytical roles that are less susceptible to technological change, location and automation. Historically, we have supported professional administrative roles such as customer service, data entry, and call center. We do not intend on focusing our efforts on these, among other, types of roles in 2021 and beyond unless there is a strategic client relationship or other strategic rationale.
Reimagining a More Flexible Work Environment. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused what some have referred to as a global work-from-home experiment. For Kforce, our associates have been working remotely since March 2020. Based on our frequent communications and dialogue with our associates, they have been largely successful working in this environment and have proven to exercise great ingenuity in continuing to support our clients and consultants. It was our view, early on in the COVID-19 pandemic, that the work-from-home experiment was likely to forever change the future work environment. Given this view, we initiated a “Kforce Reimagined” effort to begin positioning Kforce to provide a more flexible work environment for our associates, which will involve streamlining our real estate footprint and investing in technology and other tools to provide a seamless in-office and remote experience. The culmination of these efforts should provide significant contributions to improving productivity and profitability. 
Improving the Productivity of our Talent. We believe that it is critical to provide our associates with high quality tools to effectively and efficiently perform their roles, better evaluate business opportunities and advance the value we bring to our clients and consultants. We continue to enhance our sales and delivery methodologies and processes in ways we believe will allow us to better evaluate and shape business opportunities with our clients as well as train our sales and delivery associates to follow our consistent and uniform methodology.
During 2020, we continued developing and began implementing a new talent relationship management (TRM) system that we expect will better leverage our delivery strategies and processes and improve our capabilities. We have agilely deployed our TRM system and the final release of the initial functionality is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2021. Going forward, we will continue to make enhancements to our business and data intelligence capabilities. These investments are part of a multi-year effort to upgrade our technology tools to equip our associates with improved capabilities to deliver exceptional service to our clients, consultants and candidates and improve the productivity of our associates and the scalability of our organization.
Critical to improving the performance of our associates is the development of a strong management team. A key pillar of our talent development strategy is to provide our leaders with the skills necessary to lead their teams effectively. During 2020, we initiated leadership development activities that included ongoing training both specific to our industry and generally on leading people. These activities will be ongoing and, we believe, will lead to improved associate performance and higher retention levels of our associates.
In 2021, we will also begin an assessment of our middle and back office capabilities that will support the investments we have made in our front office and we believe will ultimately bring significant efficiency and effectiveness to our back office support organization.
Enhancing our Client Relationships. We strive to differentiate ourselves by working collaboratively with our clients to better understand their business challenges and help them attain their organizational objectives. This collaboration focuses on building a consultative partnership rather than a transactional client relationship, which increases the intimacy we have with our clients and improves our ability to offer higher value and a broader array of services and support to our clients. To accomplish this, we align our revenue-generating talent with clients based on their experience with markets, products, industries and in the case of a managed teams and solutions offering, expertise in the related technology or project. 
We measure our success in building long-lasting relationships with our clients using staffing industry benchmarks and Net Promoter Score (“NPS”) surveys conducted by a specialized, independent third-party provider. Our client NPS ratings are amongst the highest in the industry and provide helpful insights from our clients on how to continue improving our relationships. We believe long-lasting relationships with our clients is a critical element in revenue growth.
Improving the Job Seeker Experience. Our consultants are a critical component of our business and essential in sustaining our client relationships. In 2020, we were able to utilize our talent community platform through WorkLLama, specifically its referral management capability, to provide us leverage in the timely sourcing of qualified candidates. We believe this seamlessly connects the candidate with the recruiter, which improves the job seeker’s experience and provides a better quality candidate. We are focused on effective and efficient processes and tools to find and attract prospective consultants, matching them to a client assignment and supporting them during their tenure with Kforce. Our success in this regard would be expected to positively influence the tenure and loyalty of our consultants and be their employer of choice, thus enabling us to deliver the highest quality talent to our clients. 
We measure the quality of our service to and support of our consultants using staffing industry benchmarks and NPS surveys conducted by a specialized, independent third-party provider. Our consultant NPS ratings, similar to our client ratings, are well above staffing industry averages. We continually seek direct feedback from our consultants, which helps us identify opportunities to refine our services.
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive and fragmented staffing industry comprised of large national and local staffing firms. The local firms are typically operator-owned, and each market generally has one or more significant competitors. Within our managed teams and solutions business, we also face competition from national and regional accounting, consulting and advisory firms and national and regional strategic consulting and systems implementation firms. We believe that our boundaryless reach within the U.S., physical presence in larger markets, concentration of service offerings in areas of greatest demand (especially technology), national delivery teams, centralized delivery channels for foreign consultants, including those obtained via the H-1B visa program which optimizes distribution and strengthens compliance, longevity of our brand and reputation in the market, along with our dedicated compliance and regulatory infrastructure, all provide a competitive advantage. 
Many clients utilize Managed Service Providers (“MSP”) or Vendor Management Organizations (“VMO”) for the management and procurement of staffing services. Generally, MSPs and VMOs standardize processes through the use of Vendor Management Systems (“VMS”), which are tools used to aggregate spend and measure supplier performance. VMSs are also offered through independent providers. Typically, MSPs, VMOs and/or VMS providers charge staffing firms administrative fees ranging from 1% to 4% of revenue. In addition, the aggregation of services by MSPs for their clients into a single program can result in significant buying power and, thus, pricing power. Therefore, the use of MSPs by our clients has, in certain instances, resulted in margin compression, but has also led to incremental client share through our client’s vendor consolidation efforts. Kforce does not currently provide MSP or VMO services directly to our clients; rather, our strategy has been to work with MSPs, VMOs and VMS providers that enable us to better extend our services to current and prospective clients.
We believe that the principal elements of competition in our industry are differentiated offerings, reputation, the availability and quality of associates, consultants and candidates, level of service, effective monitoring of job performance, scope of geographic service, types of service offerings and compliance orientation. To attract consultants and candidates, we emphasize our ability to provide competitive compensation and benefits, quality and varied assignments, scheduling flexibility and permanent placement opportunities, all of which are important to Kforce being the employer of choice. Because individuals pursue other employment opportunities on a regular basis, it is important that we respond to market conditions affecting these individuals and focus on our consultant relationship objectives. Additionally, in certain markets, from time to time we have experienced significant pricing pressure as a result of our competitors’ pricing strategies, which may result in us not being able to effectively compete or choosing to not participate in certain business that does not meet our profitability standard.
Regulatory Environment
Staffing firms are generally subject to one or more of the following types of government regulations: (1) regulation of the employer/employee relationship, such as wage and hour regulations, tax withholding and reporting, immigration/H-1B visa regulations, social security and other retirement, anti-discrimination, employee benefits and workers’ compensation regulations; (2) registration, licensing, recordkeeping and reporting requirements; and (3) worker classification regulations.
Because we operate in a complex regulatory environment, one of our top priorities is compliance. For more discussion of the potential impact that the regulatory environment could have on Kforce’s financial results, refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Insurance
Kforce maintains a number of insurance policies including general liability, automobile liability, workers’ compensation and employers’ liability, liability for certain foreign exposure, umbrella and excess liability, property, crime, fiduciary, directors and 
officers, employment practices liability, cybersecurity, professional liability and excess health insurance coverage. These policies provide coverage subject to their terms, conditions, limits of liability and deductibles, for certain liabilities that may arise from Kforce’s operations. There can be no assurance that any of the above policies will be adequate for our needs or that we will maintain all such policies in the future.
Human Capital Management 
Core Values
At the heart of Kforce, as an organization, is a deep understanding and unwavering commitment to our core values, which are:
•We’re a team that values one another through mutual RESPECT, earned in our daily interactions.
•INTEGRITY fuels our actions with the strength to do the right thing.
•We rely on one another and let TRUST drive our team results.
•We want to give our clients, consultants and each other EXCEPTIONAL SERVICE every chance we get.
•COMMITMENT keeps us together as one team dedicated to individual and Firm success.
•Our spirit and culture need FUN to truly thrive.
•Standing up for STEWARDSHIP & COMMUNITY with a servant’s heart keeps us grounded and humble. 
Commitment to Values and Ethics
Along with our core values, we act in accordance with our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (“Code of Conduct”), which sets forth expectations and guidance for associates to make appropriate decisions. Our Code of Conduct covers topics such as anti-corruption, discrimination, harassment, privacy, appropriate use of company assets, protecting confidential information and reporting violations. The Code of Conduct reflects our commitment to operating in a fair, honest, responsible and ethical manner and also provides direction for reporting complaints in the event of alleged violations of our policies (including through an anonymous hotline). 
Employees and Personnel
As of December 31, 2020, Kforce employed approximately 2,000 associates, including roughly 1,300 supporting the revenue-generating aspects of our business and approximately 700 supporting the revenue-enabling aspects. We also had approximately 11,900 consultants on assignment providing flexible staffing services and solutions to our clients. Approximately 90% of these consultants are employed directly by Kforce and 10% are qualified independent contractors. As the employer, Kforce is responsible for the employer’s share of applicable social security taxes (“FICA”), federal and state unemployment taxes, workers’ compensation insurance and other direct labor costs relating to our employees. The more pertinent health, welfare and retirement benefits include: comprehensive health insurance; workers’ compensation benefits, retirement plan options; employee stock purchase plan and paid time off. We have no collective bargaining agreements covering any of our employees, have never experienced any material labor disruption, and are unaware of any current efforts or plans of our employees to organize.
Health and Safety
Central to our overall operating philosophy is our belief that our employees are key to achieving our business objectives; therefore, their safety is our highest priority. In keeping with this principle, we have been thoughtful and aggressive in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic as it relates to our employees. Some of the measures include: 
•Requiring our associates to work remotely since March 2020;
•Prohibiting non-essential travel for all employees;
•Initiating regular communications from our executives regarding impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including health and safety protocols and procedures;
•Establishing new physical distancing procedures for employees and employees who need to be onsite;
•Procuring personal protective equipment, including, among other items, masks, sanitization stations, temperature-reading devices, plexiglass workstation dividers, for distribution to our associates and consultants and use in our physical workspaces;
•Distributing corporate assets, including, among other items, office chairs, computer monitors, docking stations, communication devices, to employees to enable remote work, as necessary;
•Providing a one-time subsidy to each of our associates to cover business expenses and other unanticipated needs stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, including, among things, child-care, tutoring services;
•Enhancing our health and wellness offerings to include a digital self-care platform to help our associates with any mental health concerns;
•Investing in technologies and tools to improve the effectiveness of our associates while working remotely; and
•Improving our associate outreach efforts to detect and try to address any challenges or needs of our associates.
Talent Management and Leadership Development
Our key talent philosophy is to identify, train and develop talent from within to help ensure that we maintain a consistent operating model. A core objective is to add new associates in entry-level recruiting roles so that our new associates learn the proper foundational understanding of our business. We believe that this will result in improving productivity and increased talent retention. This approach has yielded a deep understanding among our employee base of our business, our products, and our customers, while adding new employees and ideas in support of our continuous improvement mindset. 
Among our key initiatives has been our: 
•Leadership Development Program, led by an independent third-party specialist, which is aimed at building the skills necessary to nurture strong relationships, maintain accountability and enhance productivity among the leaders across Kforce;
•Leadership Accelerator Program, which is a cross-functional, collaborative, skill-building program aligned with Kforce’s Leader’s Creed, Core Values and leadership competencies; and,
•Career Progression Program’ which creates awareness of opportunities to develop and grow within Kforce by, among other things, using tools such as a digital guide to navigate career paths and required KPIs, competencies and training.
Our talent management activities also include, but are not limited to, conducting the following activities:
•Periodic performance appraisals to promote engaging and productive communications between leaders and their team members about performance, career progression and advancement opportunities;
•Calibration sessions during the performance appraisal process to help ensure consistency across Kforce in assigning appraisal ratings; and
•9-Box exercises are conducted to evaluate our talent for targeted areas of development, assess opportunities for our talent across the Firm and for succession planning purposes.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Program
Kforce’s diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) program is overseen by Andrew Thomas, Chief Marketing and Talent Officer, and led by Donald Harvey, Senior Vice President of Diversity and Inclusion, with the mission of establishing and promoting an authentic culture of diversity, equity and inclusion at Kforce.
With the assistance of independent third party specialists, Kforce is conducting a comprehensive review of our DE&I program including, but not limited to, building an increasingly robust pipeline of diverse candidates in our talent acquisition efforts (for both associates and consultants), supplier diversity practices, training and mentorship programs as well as the focus of our stewardship activities to meet the mission and objectives of our DE&I program. This review is intended as a means to strengthen and refine already significant activities in these areas.
