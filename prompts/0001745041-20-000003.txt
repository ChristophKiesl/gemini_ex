Item 1. | Business

Our Company
We are a leading provider of auction solutions for total loss, damaged and low-value vehicles in North America and the United Kingdom. We facilitate the marketing and sale of vehicles for a variety of sellers, including insurance companies, used-vehicle dealers, rental car and fleet lease companies, auto lenders and charitable organizations, among others. Our solutions provide buyers from around the globe with the vehicles they need to, among other things, fulfill their vehicle rebuild requirements, replacement part inventory or scrap demand. Fees for our services are earned from both buyers and sellers of vehicles sold through our channels. Approximately two-thirds of our revenue is earned from buyers and one-third of our revenue is earned from vehicle suppliers or sellers.
In exchange for agreed-upon processing and service fees, we sell total loss, damaged and low-value vehicles on behalf of vehicle sellers primarily on a consignment basis, meaning that our sellers continue to own their vehicles until they are sold to buyers through one of our marketplaces. We also offer our vehicle sellers a number of other services for which fees may be charged, including, but not limited to, procuring and processing vehicle titles, inspection services, processing auto insurance claims, marketing and other services. In addition to the fees we collect from our vehicle sellers, we also charge service fees to our buyers for each vehicle purchased based on a tiered structure that increases with the sales price of the vehicle. We likewise offer our buyers additional services for which we also charge service fees.
We market vehicles to prospective buyers through our many marketplaces, 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. Auctions are typically held weekly for most locations and allow bidders to participate online and physically at the auction. Certain vehicles are also offered for sale online via IAA Timed AuctionsTM, where bidders may bid on those vehicles for a fixed duration of time and via IAA Buy NowTM where vehicles are offered for sale at a fixed price. All vehicles which are ready for sale are listed and available online on IAA Auction CenterTM, allowing prospective bidders to preview and bid on vehicles prior to the live auction event. IAA Auction Center includes a "Fast Search" function that allows for filtering to quickly locate specific vehicles and offers logged-in buyers additional services such as "Enhanced Vehicle Details" that includes VIN details and Hollander Interchange parts data to help buyers make informed purchasing decisions. IAA Auction Center provides online buyers with an open, competitive bidding environment. Our mobile and online capabilities provide buyers the greatest flexibility in their purchasing options, exposing vehicles to bidders from around the globe and allowing bidders to participate in a greater number of auctions. Online inventory browsing and digital alerts (via email or through buyer app) reduce the time required to acquire vehicles, and the broader market exposure and increased competitive bidding generally drive higher selling prices. We believe the capabilities of our auction models maximize auction proceeds and returns to our vehicle sellers.
Our unique multi-channel marketplace, which provides buyers choice in how they bid and buy, is a key differentiator of our service offering and helps sellers in achieving the highest selling price on a given vehicle. Leveraging leading-edge technology and focusing on innovation, we process approximately 2.5 million total loss, damaged and low-value vehicles annually.
Our Corporate History and Our Separation from KAR Auction Services
IAA was incorporated in Delaware on June 19, 2018. IAA entered the vehicle salvage business in 1982, and first became a public company in 1991. After growing through a series of acquisitions, IAA was acquired by two private equity firms in 2005. The two private equity firms and certain members of IAA management contributed IAA to KAR in 2007. 
On February 27, 2018, KAR announced a plan to pursue the separation and spin-off (the "Separation") of IAA (its salvage auction services business) into a separate public company. On June 28, 2019 (the "Separation Date"), KAR completed the distribution of 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of IAA to the holders of record of KAR's common stock on June 18, 2019, on a pro rata basis (the "Distribution"). Following the Separation and Distribution, IAA became an independent publicly-traded company and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "IAA."

2019 Highlights

• | The second quarter of 2019 marked a significant milestone in our history as we successfully executed our spin-off from KAR to become an independent publicly traded company.


• | In connection with the Separation, we entered into a $225 million five-year revolving credit facility, and an $800 million seven-year senior secured term loan facility and we issued $500 million of senior unsecured notes due 2027. See Note 10 - Debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.


• | On July 31, 2019, we acquired Decision Dynamics, Inc. ("DDI"), a leading electronic lien and title technology firm located in Lexington, South Carolina for a total consideration of $19.2 million. Annual revenue for DDI was approximately $8.3 million in the 12 months prior to acquisition. See Note 4 - Acquisitions in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Our Industry
The salvage vehicle auction industry provides a venue for sellers, primarily automobile insurance companies, to dispose or liquidate total loss, damaged or low-value vehicles to either domestic and international dismantlers, rebuilders, scrap dealers or qualified public buyers.
We believe that the salvage vehicle auction industry currently benefits from several thematic tailwinds, including (i) a growing and aging Automotive Car Parc (as defined below), (ii) increasing miles driven, (iii) increasing vehicle complexity and total loss frequency and (iv) increasing utilization of recycled and alternative automotive parts.
(i) Growing and Aging Automotive Car Parc
In North America, the salvage vehicle marketplace has benefited from a growing number of vehicles on the road ("Car Parc") and an increasing average age of vehicles. Growth in the number of vehicles in operation contributes to a rising number of automotive accidents, which supports increased volumes through our marketplaces. Meanwhile, vehicle owners have continued to drive the same vehicle for longer periods of time. As vehicles become older and their residual values decline, it becomes more likely that these vehicles will surpass the total loss threshold when involved in an accident and be sold on behalf of insurers through our marketplaces.
(ii) Increasing Miles Driven
The salvage vehicle marketplace is directly impacted by the number of miles driven. An increase in the number of miles driven contributes to a rising number of automotive accidents, which supports increased volumes through our marketplaces. 
(iii) Increasing Vehicle Complexity and Total Loss Frequency
Vehicle design has become increasingly complex in recent years, as automotive manufacturers seek to differentiate themselves from competitors by incorporating new and more complex technologies and other enhancements into their designs to reduce weight and improve fuel efficiency. This has resulted in higher repair and part replacement costs following an accident, making insurance companies more likely to declare a damaged vehicle a total loss. The percentage of claims resulting in total losses has steadily increased over the last five years. When a vehicle is deemed a total loss, insurers typically auction the vehicle through a salvage vehicle marketplace.
(iv) Increasing Utilization of Recycled and Alternative Automotive Parts
As insurance companies continue to identify ways to reduce their claim costs, the utilization and acceptance rates continue to increase for recycled parts from total loss vehicles and aftermarket replacement parts. We believe this trend is helping increase revenue for our buyer base, which in turn increases demand for our marketplaces. 
5

Our Strengths
We believe we distinguish ourselves through the following competitive strengths, which we expect to continue to enhance as a standalone company:
Market Leadership and Expertise in the Salvage Vehicle Auction Industry
We are one of the two largest providers of total loss, damaged and low-value vehicle auction services in North America. We have been operating in our market in North America since 1982 and have sold approximately 23 million vehicles since 2007 through our marketplaces and benefit from longstanding insight and expertise in the space. We are also the clear market leader in the Canadian market, with a long track record of growth, operating under the Impact Auto Auctions brand. 
Significant Presence Through Our Unique Multi-Channel Marketplace 
Our unique multi-channel marketplace, which provides buyers choice in how they bid and buy, is a key differentiator of our service offering and helps sellers in achieving the highest selling price on a given vehicle. We currently operate over 200 sites across the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, representing total acreage of approximately 7,700 gross acres. Our broad facility footprint improves pick-up, storage, titling and other ancillary services for our customers.
Our online marketplaces allow prospective bidders to preview, bid and potentially buy vehicles prior to the auction event. Online inventory browsing and digital alerts (via email or through our buyer app) reduce the time required to acquire vehicles. North American online sales volumes for IAA for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019 represented approximately 70% of the total vehicles sold by IAA.
Industry-Leading Technology and Data Analytics Capabilities
We have made substantial investments in technology throughout our history to ensure that we are providing market-leading solutions for our customers. Our technology and analytics capabilities have translated into strong and deeply embedded customer relationships with both sellers and buyers.
Our current online solutions include (i) IAA 360 ViewTM - our latest proprietary interactive technology, which provides online vehicle buyers an interactive 360o visual of the vehicle's interior and exterior, (ii) AuctionNowTM - a proprietary live online bidding platform, (iii) IAA Buy Now - a complementary product to our live and live online platforms, allowing buyers to purchase vehicles between auction dates, (iv) CSAToday® - our industry-leading seller portal where consignors can manage vehicle assignment, release and sale, as well as a suite of data and analytics reporting tools, (v) Automated Salvage Auction Processing - a proprietary web-based application which streamlines all aspects of our operations, and is the source for our 24/7 access that consignors enjoy through CSAToday® and (vi) IAA Timed Auctions - allows for bidding and buying of vehicles for a fixed time period before a scheduled live auction.
IAA Total Loss Solutions®
We have pioneered and developed a leading and highly differentiated set of solutions for the total loss claims process that demonstrate our focus on comprehensive customer service beyond the traditional auction. We believe our solutions are valued by our customers, which enhances our customer relationships and overall customer satisfaction.
Total Loss Solutions® is a comprehensive suite of services with products designed to help process total loss vehicle claims efficiently beginning with the loss event all the way through to asset liquidation. The suite was built with an eye toward workforce efficiency and customer service. Total Loss Solutions® includes services spanning from first notice of loss to vehicle sale at auction including: IAA Title Services®, Title Procurement Dashboard, IAA Inspection Services®, IAA Loan Payoff™, IAA Loss Advisor™, MyVehicleClaim.com and IAA Active Inventory Management.
Long-Standing and Diversified Relationship with Major National Insurers
We have established and maintain strong relationships with virtually all of the major automobile insurance companies. Approximately 40% of our revenues in fiscal 2019 were associated with the vehicles supplied by our three largest insurance customers in our United States segment. 
Extensive Global Buyer Network
Approximately two-thirds of our revenue is earned from buyers. We have a large, diverse and global buyer base that purchases vehicles through our marketplaces. Our active database of tens of thousands of buyers improves the efficiency and efficacy of our marketplaces, ultimately benefiting both buyers and sellers. 
6

Our buyer network is diversified. The largest buyer accounted for approximately 3% of total fiscal 2019 revenue, while no other buyer accounted for more than 2% of total revenue in fiscal 2019.
Attractive Profitability and Margin Profile Driving Long-Term Operating Leverage
We benefit from attractive profitability and margins due to substantial operating leverage. Over the past two years, we have consistently achieved an Adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 29% maintained through our culture and focus on operational efficiency. 
Flexible and Efficient Financial Model 
Our low maintenance capital expenditures and working capital requirements enable the business to generate strong cash flows. We expect our low capital intensity model to allow us to produce strong cash flow from operations, providing us great strategic and financial flexibility. 
From an inventory perspective, we do not take title to or bear the risk of loss for the vast majority of vehicles sold through our marketplaces. Furthermore, buyers do not receive title or possession of vehicles after purchase until payment in full is received. These practices contribute to limited inventory and accounts receivable exposure.
Experienced Management Team with a Strong Track Record 
We are led by a senior management team with extensive industry experience. Our President and CEO, John Kett, joined IAA in 2001 and has served in various executive leadership roles, including CFO, President and CEO since 2014.
We benefit from our team’s industry knowledge and track record of market leadership, successful product innovation and financial performance. Additionally, our senior management team has experience executing and integrating acquisitions.
Our Business Strategy
We maintain a long history of strong and consistent execution that has led to growth in the business over several decades in periods under both private and public ownership. We also hold a strong track record of acquiring and integrating independent auction operations and improving profitability. We seek to grow our business through the execution of the following strategies, among others: 
Enhance Existing Relationships and Expand Market Share
We continue to maintain strong relationships with virtually all of the major automobile insurance companies and increase our penetration of non-insurance sellers. Additionally, we provide an alternative venue for damaged and lower-value vehicles and, as a result, non-insurance sellers have contributed to our growth.
Broaden Our Service Offering to Deepen Strategic Relationships
Our market-leading Total Loss Solutions® provides insurance companies with end-to-end outsourced solutions for the portion of the claims process prior to total loss determination and assignment to a salvage vehicle auction and helps insurance companies reduce cycle time and cost, while improving employee engagement and customer service, ultimately increasing policyholder retention. We continue to add additional innovative services and capabilities to our leading end-to-end solutions.
Continue to Enhance International Buyer Network
We are a leader in developing an international buyer network and continue to enhance our network through digital marketing, market alliance partners, and in country visits. We have customized our marketing approaches to cater to local cultures and ways of doing business, and have invested significant resources in developing a deep understanding of the unique needs of each international market. Expanding the base of international buyers brings more bidders to our platform and yields better outcomes for sellers in our marketplaces.
Our success is evident in the number of international buyers on our U.S. marketplace growing by approximately 70% from 2014 to 2019. Our further commitment to our international buyers is demonstrated by our buyer portal, which is available online in 6 languages and our call center, which currently supports 13 languages.

Continue to Expand Margins Through Cost Reductions, Operating Efficiencies and Ancillary Services
We are focused on reducing costs and driving efficiencies while also maintaining our level of customer service. As a part of our buyer digital transformation initiative, we are in the process of moving to an almost entirely online auction model which is expected to generate cost savings by eliminating live physical auctions. We are also shortening the time it takes a vehicle to move through the auction process, which will further improve the service we provide our customers, reduce depreciation on vehicle values, and also improve our operating margins by making our real estate usage more efficient. Over the last five years, we have shortened the auction process through the deployment of a variety of initiatives. We also continuously analyze how we store cars to optimize our real estate usage and process more volume without incurring incremental costs. We have further deployed digital tools to our yard operations to speed up and improve the vehicle check-in, title, inventory and sale processes.
Continue to Innovate and Enhance Data Analytics Capabilities
Our solutions deliver enhanced economic benefits to our customers by increasing transparency and reducing cycle time and friction throughout the process. We plan to continue to broaden our product portfolio by investing in the development of innovative solutions that further improve our customers’ results.
Using our data analytics expertise, we can provide better tools for both sellers and buyers to be better informed and make better, more confident decisions to improve their results and satisfaction.
Expand Internationally in Attractive Markets
For the year ended December 29, 2019, approximately 12% of our revenues were generated outside of the United States, and we are in the process of establishing or continuing to build operations in key geographic markets. In Canada, we plan to continue increasing our presence organically through Impact Auto Auctions Ltd. and in the United Kingdom, we plan to continue increasing our presence organically through HBC Vehicle Services Limited.
We also intend to strategically enter new markets by pursuing strategic acquisitions, partnerships or greenfield opportunities in high priority markets globally.
Employ Disciplined Capital Allocation Strategy 
We generate strong cash flows as a result of our attractive gross margins, the ability to leverage our corporate infrastructure across our multiple auction locations, low maintenance capital expenditures and limited working capital requirements. We are committed to adopting a balanced and disciplined capital allocation policy that will enable us to deliver attractive long-term stockholder value. Our long-term goal is to drive growth through disciplined investments in our organic business and through acquisitions, while also strengthening our balance sheet through debt reduction and returning capital to stockholders. 
Our Business Segments
Effective in the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company determined that it has two operating segments: United States, and International. These two operating segments also represent our two reportable segments. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2019, we had one reportable segment: United States. The change from one reportable segment to two reportable segments was based on quantitative and qualitative considerations, and was a result of recent changes in our organizational structure, resource allocation, and corresponding financial reporting. These segments represent geographic areas and reflect how the chief operating decision maker allocates resources and measures results. See Note - 15 - Segment Information in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information.
Our Operations 
We generate a significant portion of our revenue from auction fees and related services associated with our salvage auctions. Approximately two-thirds of our revenue is earned from buyers and represents fees charged based on a tiered structure that increases with the sales price of the vehicle as well as service fees for additional services. In addition, approximately one-third of our revenue is earned from vehicle suppliers or sellers and represents the combination of the inbound tow, processing, storage, titling, enhancing and auctioning of the vehicle. We purchase only a small amount of vehicles as the majority of our business comprises auctioning vehicles on consignment. However, when we do purchase vehicles, we record the entire sale price as revenue and the purchase price as cost of services, which results in lower gross margin versus vehicles sold at auction on a consignment basis. Although auction revenues primarily include the auction services and related fees, our related receivables and payables include the gross value of the vehicles sold. 
8

Our operating expenses consist of cost of services, selling, general and administrative and depreciation and amortization. Cost of services is comprised of payroll and related costs, subcontract services, the cost of vehicles purchased, supplies, insurance, property taxes, utilities, service contract claims, maintenance and lease expense related to the auction sites. Cost of services excludes depreciation and amortization. Selling, general and administrative expenses are comprised of, among other things, payroll and related costs, sales and marketing, information technology services and professional fees.
Services and Solutions
We offer a comprehensive suite of auction, logistics and vehicle-selling services and solutions aimed at maximizing the value of vehicles sold through our marketplaces, lowering administrative costs, shortening the selling cycle and increasing the predictability of returns to vehicle sellers. This is achieved while expanding IAA’s ability to handle an increasing proportion of the vehicle-processing function as a “one-stop shop” for sellers. Some of the services and solutions provided by IAA to sellers include:

Customers
We obtain our supply of vehicles from insurance companies, used vehicle dealers, rental car and fleet leasing companies, auto lenders and charitable organizations, among others. We have established long-term relationships with virtually all of the major automobile insurance companies. The vast majority of the vehicles we process are on a consignment basis. The buyers of damaged and total loss vehicles include automotive body shops, rebuilders, used car dealers, automotive wholesalers, exporters, dismantlers, recyclers, brokers, and where allowed, non-licensed (public) buyers, among others. Approximately two-thirds of our revenue is earned from buyers and one-third of our revenue is earned from vehicle suppliers or sellers. During fiscal 2019, approximately 40% of our revenues were associated with vehicles supplied by our three largest insurance customers in the United States segment.
Sales and Marketing
Our sales force solicits prospective vehicle sellers and buyers at the national, regional and local levels. Branch managers address customer needs at the local level. We also participate in a number of local, regional and national trade show events that further promote the benefits of our products and services.
In addition to providing sellers with a means of processing and selling vehicles, we offer a comprehensive suite of services to help maximize returns and shorten the selling and processing time. We help establish workflow integration within our sellers' processes, and view such mutually beneficial relationships as an essential component of our effort to attract and retain suppliers.
10

Our broad and industry leading geographic coverage allows us to service sellers on a national basis.
Our Internal Online Operating Solutions 
Our current internal online operating solutions include:
Automated Salvage Auction Processing (ASAP): We have developed a proprietary web-based information system, Automated Salvage Auction Processing system, or ASAP, to streamline all aspects of our operations and centralize operational data collection for the United States segment. The system provides sellers with 24-hour online access to powerful tools to manage the salvage disposition process, including inventory management, sales price analysis and electronic data interchange of titling information. Our other information systems, including AuctionNowTM and CSAToday® systems, are integrated with our ASAP product, facilitating auction processes and information flow with internal operational systems.
VISion: We have also developed a proprietary web-based information system, VISion, to streamline all aspects of our operations and centralize data collection for the International segment. The system is similar to ASAP and integrates with IAA technology products enabling us to be responsive to the needs of our international customers and operations. 
Competition
Our principal competitors include Copart, Inc.; Total Resource Auctions, a subsidiary of Cox Enterprises, Inc.; independent auctions and a limited number of used vehicle auctions that regularly remarket damaged and total loss vehicles. Additionally, some dismantlers of damaged and total loss vehicles and Internet-based companies also enter the market from time to time. While most insurance companies have abandoned or reduced efforts to sell damaged and total loss vehicles without the use of service providers such as us, they may in the future decide to dispose of their vehicles directly to end users. See "Our market position and competitive advantage could be threatened by our competitors and/or disruptive new entrants" included in Item 1A, Risk Factors for additional information. 
Seasonality
The volume of vehicles sold through our auctions generally fluctuates from quarter to quarter. This seasonality is caused by several factors including weather, the timing of used vehicles available for sale from selling customers, the availability and quality of salvage vehicles, holidays, and the seasonality of the retail market for used vehicles, which affects the demand side of the auction industry. Used vehicle auction volumes tend to decline during prolonged periods of winter weather conditions. In addition, mild weather conditions and decreases in traffic volume can each lead to a decline in the available supply of salvage vehicles because fewer traffic accidents occur, resulting in fewer damaged vehicles overall. As a result, revenues and operating expenses related to volume will fluctuate accordingly on a quarterly basis. The fourth calendar quarter typically experiences lower used vehicle auction volume as well as additional costs associated with the holidays and winter weather.
Vehicle Regulation
Our operations are subject to regulation, supervision and licensing under various federal, state, provincial and local authorities, agencies, statutes and ordinances, which, among other things, require us to obtain and maintain certain licenses, permits and qualifications and provide certain disclosures and notices. Some examples of the regulations and laws that impact our company are included in Item 1A, Risk Factors under the risk: "We are subject to certain governmental regulations, including vehicle brokerage and auction laws and currency reporting obligations. Our business is subject to risks related to litigation and regulatory actions."
Environmental Regulation
Our operations are subject to various foreign, federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing the emission or discharge of pollutants into the air or water, the generation, treatment, storage and release of hazardous materials and wastes and the investigation and remediation of contamination. Our failure to comply with current or future environmental, health or safety laws or to obtain and comply with permits required under such laws, could subject us to significant liability or require costly investigative, remedial or corrective actions.
11

In the used vehicle remarketing industry, large numbers of vehicles, including wrecked vehicles at salvage auctions, are stored and/or refurbished at auction facilities and during that time minor releases of fuel, motor oil and other materials may occur. We have investigated or remediated, or are currently investigating or remediating, contamination resulting from various sources, including gasoline, fuel additives (such as methyl tertiary butyl ether, or MTBE), motor oil, petroleum products and other hazardous materials released from aboveground or underground storage tanks or in connection with current or former operations conducted at our facilities. We have incurred, and may in the future incur, expenditures relating to releases of hazardous materials, investigative, remedial or corrective actions, claims by third parties and other environmental issues, and such expenditures, individually or in the aggregate, could be significant.
Federal and state environmental authorities are currently investigating IAA's role, if any, in contributing to contamination at the Lower Duwamish Waterway Superfund Site in Seattle, Washington. IAA's potential liability, if any, at this site cannot be estimated at this time. See Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of this matter. 
Management considers the likelihood of loss or the incurrence of a liability, as well as the ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss, in determining loss contingencies. We accrue an estimated loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss (or range of possible losses) can be reasonably estimated. Management regularly evaluates current information available to determine whether accrual amounts should be adjusted. Accruals for contingencies including environmental matters are included in "Other accrued expenses" at undiscounted amounts and exclude claims for recoveries from insurance or other third parties. These accruals are adjusted periodically as assessment and remediation efforts progress, or as additional technical or legal information becomes available. If the amount of an actual loss is greater than the amount accrued, this could have an adverse impact on our operating results in that period.
Employees
At December 29, 2019, we had a total of approximately 3,800 employees, of which approximately 3,300 were located in the United States and approximately 500 were located in Canada and the United Kingdom. Approximately 98% of our workforce consists of full-time employees. 
In addition to the employee workforce, we also utilize temporary labor services to assist in handling the vehicles consigned to us and to provide certain other services. Nearly all of our auctioneers are independent contractors. Some of the services we provide are outsourced to third party providers that perform the services either on-site or off-site. The use of third party providers depends upon the resources available at each auction facility as well as peaks in the volume of vehicles offered at auction.
