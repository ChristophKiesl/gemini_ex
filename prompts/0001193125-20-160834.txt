ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

 We are a leading independent healthcare technology platform that provides data and analytics-driven solutions to improve clinical, financial, administrative, and patient engagement outcomes in the U.S. healthcare system. We offer a comprehensive suite of software, analytics, technology-enabled services and network solutions that drive improved results in the complex workflows of healthcare system payers and providers. Our solutions are designed to improve clinical decision making, simplify billing, collection and payment processes, and enable a better patient experience. 
 We began our operations on March 1, 2017 upon completion of certain joint venture transactions whereby McKesson Corporation (McKesson) contributed the majority of its technology solutions segment and Change Healthcare Inc. (formerly HCIT Holdings, Inc.) contributed substantially all of Change Healthcare Performance, Inc.s (formerly Change Healthcare, Inc.) legacy business to Change Healthcare LLC (the Joint Venture). From the time of its formation on June 17, 2016 until March 1, 2017, the Joint Venture had no substantive assets or operations. On July 1, 2019, Change Healthcare Inc., the owner of approximately 30% of the Joint Venture, completed its initial public offering. The proceeds of the offering were subsequently contributed to the Joint Venture in exchange for additional units of the Joint Venture, which together with the Companys existing holding represented an approximate 41% interest in the Joint Venture immediately following the initial public offering. On March 10, 2020, Change Healthcare Inc. combined with a subsidiary of McKesson and the owner of the remaining 58% of the Joint Venture (SpinCo) in a two-step all-stock Reverse Morris Trust transaction that involved (1) a separation of SpinCo from McKesson followed by (2) the merger of SpinCo with and into Change Healthcare Inc., with Change Healthcare Inc. as the surviving company. In connection with the transaction, electing McKesson stockholders received shares of Change Healthcare Inc. common stock in exchange for McKesson common stock. As a result, the Joint Venture became a wholly owned subsidiary of Change Healthcare Inc. and McKesson no longer has any ownership interest in the Joint Venture. 
 We offer comprehensive, end-to-end solutions with modular capabilities to address our customers needs. Working with our customers to analyze workflows used before, during, and after care has been delivered to patients, we design and commercialize innovative solutions for various points in the healthcare delivery continuum. Our offerings range from discrete data and analytics solutions to broad enterprise-wide solutions, which include workflow software and technology-enabled services that help our customers achieve operational objectives. As payers and providers become larger and more sophisticated, and manage increasingly complex workflows, we believe they will increasingly seek strategic partners with scale and comprehensive, high-value solutions designed to scale. 
 Our Intelligent Healthcare Network was created to facilitate the transfer of data among participants and is one of the largest clinical and financial healthcare networks in the U.S. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, we facilitated over 15 billion healthcare transactions and approximately $1.5 trillion in adjudicated claims or more than one-third of all U.S. healthcare expenditures. We serve the vast majority of U.S. payers and providers. Our customer base includes approximately 2,400 government and commercial payer connections, 1,000,000 physicians, 125,000 dentists, 39,000 pharmacies, 6,000 hospitals and 700 laboratories. This network transacts clinical records for over 85 million unique patients, approximately one-quarter of the estimated total U.S. population. With insights gained from our pervasive network, extensive applications and analytics portfolio, and our services operations, we have designed analytics solutions that include trusted, industry-leading franchises supported by extensive intellectual property and regularly updated content. 
 In addition to the advantages of scale, we believe we offer the collaborative benefits of a mission-critical partner. We seek to establish and develop enduring relationships with each customer through solutions that deliver measurable results, embedded in their complex daily workflows that deliver measurable results. Our customer retention rate for our top 50 provider and top 50 payer customers was 99% for the fiscal year ended 
 
5 


  March 31, 2020. We believe our size, scale, expertise, and prevalence throughout the healthcare ecosystem help make us a preferred partner for technology companies and industry associations focused on driving innovation, standardization and efficiencies in the healthcare industry.

8 


  Nashville, Minneapolis, and Tel Aviv. We believe that our deep reach across the healthcare ecosystem and our history of commercializing innovations position us to be a preferred partner for customers and leading healthcare and technology companies. 
 We believe we are well positioned for growth across the markets we serve. Our growth strategy is to increase the breadth and depth of our capabilities organically and through acquisitions. We continue to increase our business with a strong base of long-standing customers by expanding our enterprise relationships and positioning them for success in their markets. Our comprehensive end-to-end solutions can reduce the complexity of our customers environments, yet are modular to meet their specific needs. We seek to use our data products and analytics, pervasive connectivity and our position as a trusted partner to develop innovative ways to create high-value clinical and administrative solutions. We believe we are in the early stages of growth related to these opportunities. 
 Market Opportunity 
 We compete in the market for data and analytics-driven solutions that help ensure clinically appropriate care, increase efficiency and reduce waste in the healthcare industry. We believe the following trends impacting payers, providers and consumers represent a significant opportunity for us. 
 Wasteful spending amidst rising costs in the U.S. healthcare system. 
 

Note: Dollars in billions 
 Sources: Wasteful spending categories based upon Journal of American Medical Association (JAMA) Waste in the US Health Care System; and Dollar amounts of wasteful spending calculated based on JAMA categories and percentages applied to the implied 2019 wasteful spending amount. 
 Research cited by the Journal of the American Medical Association estimates that nearly 30% of U.S. healthcare spending is wasteful, implying approximately $1 trillion of wasteful healthcare spending in 2019. 
 
9 


  Examples of waste include failure to adhere to best care practices and lack of care coordination, which leads to unnecessary readmissions and inappropriate levels of care delivery. Wasteful spending includes significant variation among providers in the cost and quality of similar care from provider to provider, and market to market (not explained by geography alone); and also includes overtreatment, which is testing and care that is not medically beneficial. 
 Additionally, the U.S. healthcare system relies on many inefficient processes that are manual, complex, frequently changing, time consuming, prone to error, costly and requiring undue amounts of clinicians and other professionals time. In addition, improper payments, according to the Office of Management and Budget, have represented approximately 10% of all Medicare and Medicaid payments since 2015. Such improper payments and fraudulent billing create costly and labor-intensive follow-up. According to CMS, U.S. healthcare spending is expected to grow from $3.6 trillion in 2018, or 18% of U.S. gross domestic product, to $6.2 trillion, or approximately 20% of U.S. gross domestic product, by 2028. This implies that healthcare spending is increasing at a 5.4% annual growth rate, or 3.4% higher than expected inflation over the same period. Given the significant and lasting financial burden of ongoing rising costs and wasteful spending, both government and commercial payers and providers are increasingly focused on reducing costs attributable to administrative complexity and errors, excessive manual labor, and uncoordinated, unproductive, or ineffective processes. As a result, we expect continued strong demand for solutions that can aid in reducing waste, improving efficiency and help ensure delivery of clinically appropriate, value-based care. 
 Healthcare system exposure to growing chronically ill and higher risk populations. While the overall U.S. population is expected to increase 6.9% from 2019 to 2029, the population of adults age 65 and older is expected to increase 32.3% over the same period, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. This segment of the population has the highest prevalence of chronic conditions, with average annual healthcare spending approximately three times higher than working adults and approximately five times higher than the under-18 demographic, according to CMS. As those older than 65 years of age access complex care at growing rates, they are also increasingly enrolling in managed care plans that bear the risk of healthcare utilization. For example, enrollment in MA, which according to CMS, has increased from 24% to 36% of eligible lives between 2010 and 2020, is expected to increase to 51% of eligible lives by 2030, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Additionally, according to CMS, while health plans administering Medicaid covered 82% of eligible lives as of 2017, only roughly half of total Medicaid spending was managed, primarily because most dual eligibles, who are typically among the most chronically ill and disproportionately expensive beneficiaries for both programs, are not benefiting from any form of integrated care. Federal and state governmental agencies, Congress, and CMS are seeking ways to better service this group and promote efficient and effective avenues to access care. As the countrys elderly population continues to grow, and the healthcare system serves more chronically ill and higher risk populations, providers and payers will need tools to onboard and manage these populations. These include the ability to deliver appropriate care for medically complex patients, and the ability to document risk and outcomes to attain the appropriate reimbursement rates associated with these populations. 
 Increasing prevalence of value-based care and reimbursement models. The traditional fee-for-service reimbursement model is viewed as having facilitated growth in healthcare spending beyond the value provided from additional services. In response, both public and private sectors are shifting towards alternative payment models that are designed to incentivize value and quality throughout an episode of care, which encompasses most or all of the services provided to a patient to diagnose, treat, and manage a clinical condition before, during, and after care is delivered. In recent years, HHS has set quality and value targets for certain Medicare alternative payment models and private payers are accelerating their focus in a similar fashion. These payment models require a high level of documentation, robust data, sophisticated payment attribution capabilities, and advanced analytics that can adapt to new rules and goals to ensure compliance. Further, solutions seek to optimize the design, implementation, and monitoring of care delivery throughout an episode of care. Many payers and providers are still building the capabilities, expertise, and administrative processes to manage these changes adequately. They are increasingly partnering with third parties to demonstrate the achievement of the outcomes 
 
10 


  required under these value-based payment models, which requires a fundamentally different skillset than what they have deployed historically. 
 Increasing patient financial responsibility and consumerism in healthcare. As healthcare expenditures have continued to rise, employers and health plans have shifted costs to patients through increased adoption of high-deductible health plans. Enrollment in high deductible health plans with a savings option (HDHP/SO) has increased over the past five years, from 20% of covered workers in 2014 to 30% in 2019, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. This trend is expected to continue. Increases in patient financial responsibility require providers to obtain payment from the patient before and after the point of care, which in turn requires more advanced billing and collection workflows. As providers become more consumer-oriented, they require increasingly sophisticated, dynamic, and personalized solutions, which generally necessitate scale for efficient implementation and cost-effectiveness. Likewise, as patient out-of-pocket costs continue to increase, they are becoming more quality- and cost-conscious consumers, likely to make more calculated decisions regarding their healthcare consumption. These empowered healthcare consumers are demanding price transparency and decision support from their health plans to help select caregivers who deliver the highest value of care at the lowest price. Health plans are consequently partnering with third parties to provide their members with tools which enable them to assess quality and cost based on individual plan benefits. At the same time, providers seek to effectively communicate the quality and value of their services, determine patients upfront insurance eligibility, coverage, and ability to pay their portion of healthcare bills, and simplify the payment process to improve patient experience and satisfaction. 
 Proliferation of healthcare data. The U.S. government funded almost $40 billion of incentive payments to healthcare providers between 2011 and July 2018 to adopt electronic health record (EHR) technology. This has resulted in 80% of physicians and 96% of hospitals in the U.S. having certified EHR systems as of 2017, according to the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology. These EHRs, other digitized healthcare data, and the increasing amount of personal health data from smartphones, wearables, and other devices have generated unprecedented amounts of healthcare data in the U.S., and that volume is expected to grow to more than 2,300 exabytes by the end of 2020, according to the 2018 Global Big Data in Healthcare Market report by BIS Research. However, healthcare data is often siloed and unstructured, and has historically been difficult for all constituents to understand and use in a timely manner. Both healthcare professionals and consumers increasingly demand tools and solutions that standardize the transfer and collection of data, as well as the ability to mine and analyze it for actionable insights. Advancements in ML and AI are making it easier to cost-effectively utilize data at scale in real time to identify actionable insights that help improve outcomes and decrease cost. As healthcare data can be used more effectively, we expect that leading technology companies will increasingly seek partners who can effectively develop new software and analytics solutions to help payers and providers improve workflows and deliver higher quality care at lower cost to consumers.

 Data Stewardship and security. As the amount of data in healthcare grows and the ability to use that data becomes more essential to effective delivery, management, and administration, we expect data security to 
 
13 


  become increasingly important for our customers. Our history of delivering solutions while prioritizing data security and fidelity enables us to be the platform of choice for large customers and partners. We have multiple certifications on multiple offerings, including HITRUST, HIPAA, PCI, FISMA, ISO 27001, SOC2, and EHNAC, and we implement security procedures and policies informed by applicable law and recommended practices. We also aim to drive industry maturity through appointed leadership roles with HITRUST Alliance and H-ISAC (Healthcare Information Security and Analysis Center). We believe our customers will increasingly consolidate solutions providers to a handful of entrusted parties that can address large-scale healthcare cost and quality issues securely. We believe strong relationships with existing customers position us to benefit from this expected trend. 
 Predictable revenue profile and attractive, scalable model. Change Healthcare has an attractive operating profile given the predictable, recurring nature of a significant portion of our revenue combined with a scalable financial model. Our revenue is largely derived from recurring transactional, monthly-subscription and per-click formats, as well as contingency-based or long-term contracts. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, 87% of solutions revenue was Recurring Revenue. Our customer base is highly diversified, as no customer represented more than 4% of solutions revenue in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. Additionally, we benefit from high customer retention across a diversified customer base composed of approximately 58% providers and 42% payers based on solutions revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. Our business model requires moderate capital spending to grow, with capital expenditures of 8.4% of solutions revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020. We continue to streamline costs and have instituted cost improvement initiatives throughout the organization. We believe our Recurring Revenue, combined with the opportunities for continued operating improvement following the Transactions, will provide us with increasing flexibility to allocate and deploy our capital. 
 Growth Strategy 
 Develop, augment and commercialize capabilities at scale. We work closely with our customers to integrate our offerings into their workflows and business processes. Change Healthcare develops new products and services, partners with industry-leading companies and selectively acquires complementary technologies and businesses to enhance our offerings. We introduce solutions through one of three methods: internal development, commercial partnerships and acquisitions. 

 | Internal developmentWe cultivate and leverage feedback from our customers, our partners and the analytical capabilities of our platform and suite of solutions to drive commercial innovations. We utilize our decades of industry experience, technology and services capabilities to identify new insights along the administrative and clinical care continuum. Through dialogue with our customers and our position as a scaled partner to payers, providers and others, we target commercial opportunities where these insights can be applied. Working with Google Cloud, we are building a cloud-native solution to reduce cost and complexity in Enterprise Imaging.

We believe that our industry-leading customer base and platform allow us to collaborate with other software and technology leaders to develop and rapidly deploy complementary software and services. These partnerships are expansive and flexible ranging from limited scope sales relationships to arrangements in which we are a significant customer.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | AcquisitionsWe have acquired and expect to continue to acquire assets and businesses that strengthen the value we deliver to our customers. Since the Transactions (defined herein), we have completed and successfully integrated three acquisitions. We have a successful track record of identifying, integrating and scaling new and complementary capabilities.

 Maximize wallet share with customers through cross selling. Change Healthcare has significant opportunities to expand the suite of services that our long tenured and highly loyal customer base purchases from us through focused cross selling. While we seek to continually improve our product and service offerings, our sales force is focused on expanding the scope and depth of our customer relationships. Our omni-channel sales force covers medium and larger customers with direct field sales teams and uses inside sales for direct coverage of smaller customers. In addition, our sales teams are focused on embedding our technology in our partners applications and solutions. We leverage our communication with and feedback from our customers to identify and execute on opportunities which expand and deepen relationships while increasing the benefits they receive through our connectivity, software, analytics and services. 
 Deliver comprehensive, end-to-end and modular solutions to customers. Our solutions are comprehensive in that they meet a significant portion of our customers clinical and administrative needs and are integrated to improve functionality and usability, yet modular to meet the specific needs of our customers.

 Regulatory Matters 
 Substantially all of our business is directly or indirectly related to the healthcare industry and is affected by changes in the healthcare industry, including regulatory changes and fluctuations in healthcare spending. In the U.S. and other countries, the healthcare industry is highly regulated and subject to frequently changing political, legislative, regulatory and other influences. Although some regulatory requirements do not directly apply to our operations, these requirements affect the business of our payer and provider customers and the demand for our solutions. We also may be impacted by non-healthcare laws, requirements and industry standards. For example, banking and financial services industry regulations and privacy and data security regulations may impact our operations as a result of the electronic payment and remittance services we offer directly or through third-party vendors. 
 We are subject to a number of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that involve matters central to our business. Failure to satisfy those legal and regulatory requirements, or the adoption of new laws or regulations, could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. 
 
21 


  U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations are evolving and can be subject to significant change. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain. These laws are enforced by federal, state and local regulatory agencies in the jurisdictions where we operate, and in some instances also through private civil litigation. For a discussion of the risks and uncertainties affecting our business related to compliance with federal, state and other laws and regulations and other requirements, please see Risk FactorsRisks Related to Our Business and IndustryRecent and future developments in the healthcare industry could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operation or financial condition, Risk FactorsRisks Related to our Business and IndustryGovernment regulation, industry standards and other requirements create risks and challenges with respect to our compliance efforts and our business strategies, and Risk FactorsRisks Related to our Business and IndustryWe are unable to predict what changes to laws, regulations and other requirements, including related contractual obligations, might be made in the future or how those changes could affect our business or the costs of compliance. 
 Examples of the most significant of these laws include, but are not limited to, the following: 
 HIPAA Privacy and Security Requirements 
 There are numerous federal and state laws and regulations related to the privacy and security of health information. In particular, regulations promulgated pursuant to HIPAA establish privacy and security standards that limit the use and disclosure of certain individually identifiable health information (known as protected health information) and require the implementation of administrative, physical and technological safeguards to protect the privacy of protected health information and ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of electronic protected health information. The privacy regulations established under HIPAA also provide patients with rights related to understanding and controlling how their protected health information is used and disclosed. As a provider of services to entities subject to HIPAA, we are directly subject to certain provisions of the regulations as a Business Associate. We are also directly subject to the HIPAA privacy and security regulations as a Covered Entity with respect to our operations as a healthcare clearinghouse and with respect to our clinical care visit services. 
 When acting as a Business Associate under HIPAA, to the extent permitted by applicable privacy regulations and contracts and associated Business Associate Agreements with our customers, we are permitted to use and disclose protected health information to perform our solutions and for other limited purposes, but other uses and disclosures, such as marketing communications, require written authorization from the patient or must meet an exception specified under the privacy regulations. To the extent we are permitted to de-identify protected health information and use de-identified information for our purposes, determining whether such protected health information has been sufficiently de-identified to comply with the HIPAA privacy standards and our contractual obligations may require complex factual and statistical analyses and may be subject to interpretation. 
 Other Privacy and Security Requirements. In addition to HIPAA, numerous other U.S. federal and state laws govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to and confidentiality of personal information. Certain federal and state laws protect types of personal information that may be viewed as particularly sensitive. For example, the Confidentiality of Substance Use Disorder Patient Records (42 C.F.R. Part 2) is a federal law that protects information that would reveal if an individual has or had a substance abuse disorder. Similarly, New Yorks Public Health Law, Article 27-F protects information that could reveal confidential HIV-related information about an individual. Some states have enacted or are considering new laws and regulations that would further protect this information, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which builds upon and is more stringent in many respects than other state laws currently in effect in the U.S. In many cases, state laws are more restrictive than, and not preempted by, HIPAA, and may allow personal rights of action with respect to privacy or security breaches, as well as fines. State laws are contributing to increased enforcement activity and may also be subject to interpretation by various courts and other governmental authorities. Further, Congress and a number of states have considered prohibitions or limitations on the disclosure of personal and other information to individuals or entities located outside of the U.S. The U.S. Congress is also currently considering a generally applicable national privacy law that may supplant Californias and other states privacy laws. 
 
22 


 There also are numerous international privacy and security laws that govern the collection, dissemination, use, access, retention, protection, transfer and confidentiality of personal information. For example, the GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018 is more stringent than laws and regulations governing personal information in the U.S. Certain of our solutions involve the transmission and storage of customer data in various jurisdictions, which subjects the operation of that service to privacy or data protection laws and regulations in those jurisdictions. 
 Data Protection and Breaches 
 Most states require holders of personal information to maintain safeguards and take certain actions in response to a data breach, such as providing prompt notification of the breach to affected individuals or the states attorney general. In some states, these laws are limited to electronic data, but states increasingly are enacting or considering stricter and broader requirements. Additionally, HIPAA imposes certain notification requirements on both Covered Entities and Business Associates. In certain circumstances involving large breaches, requirements may even involve notification to the media. A non-permitted use or disclosure of protected health information is presumed to be a breach under HIPAA unless the Covered Entity or Business Associate establishes that there is a low probability the information has been compromised consistent with requirements enumerated in HIPAA. 
 Further, the FTC has prosecuted certain data breach cases as unfair and deceptive acts or practices under the Federal Trade Commission Act. In addition, by regulation, the FTC requires creditors, which may include some of our customers, to implement identity theft prevention programs to detect, prevent and mitigate identity theft in connection with customer accounts. Although Congress passed legislation that restricts the definition of creditor and exempts many healthcare providers from complying with this identity theft prevention rule, we may be required to apply additional resources to our existing processes to assist our affected customers in complying with this rule. 
 HIPAA Transaction and Identifier Standards 
 HIPAA and our implementing regulations mandate format and data content standards and provider identifier standards (known as the National Provider Identifier) that must be used in certain electronic transactions, such as claims, payment advice and eligibility inquiries. HHS has established standards that health plans must use for electronic fund transfers with providers, has established operating rules for certain transactions, and is in the process of establishing operating rules to promote uniformity in the implementation of the remaining types of covered transactions. The ACA also requires HHS to establish standards for health claims attachment transactions. HHS has modified the standards for electronic healthcare transactions (e.g., eligibility, claims submission and payment and electronic remittance) from Version 4010/4010A to Version 5010. Further, as of 2015, HHS requires the use of updated standard code sets for diagnoses and procedures known as the ICD-10 code sets. Enforcement of compliance with these standards falls under HHS and is carried out by CMS. 
 Anti-Kickback Laws and Anti-Referral Laws 
 A number of federal and state laws govern patient referrals, financial relationships with physicians and other referral sources and inducements to providers and patients, including restrictions contained in amendments to the Social Security Act, commonly known as the federal Anti-Kickback Statute (AKS). The AKS prohibits any person or entity from offering, paying, soliciting or receiving, directly or indirectly, anything of value with the intent of generating referrals of patients covered by Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. Courts have interpreted the law to provide that a financial arrangement may violate this law if any one of the purposes of an arrangement is to encourage patient referrals or other federal healthcare program business, regardless of whether there are other legitimate purposes for the arrangement. Violation of the AKS is a felony, and penalties for AKS violations can be severe, and include imprisonment, criminal fines, civil penalties with treble damages (when the federal False Claims Act (FCA) is implicated) and exclusion from participation in 
 
23 


  federal healthcare programs. The ACA broadened the reach of the AKS by amending the intent requirement, such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the AKS or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, as further discussed below, the ACA provided that the government may assert that a claim which includes items or services resulting from a violation of the AKS constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA, as well as restrictions contained in amendments to the Social Security Act, commonly known as the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law (CMP). The AKS contains a limited number of exceptions, and the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) of HHS has created regulatory safe harbors to the AKS. Activities that comply with a safe harbor are deemed protected from prosecution under the AKS. Failure to meet a safe harbor does not automatically render an arrangement illegal under the AKS. The arrangement, however, does risk increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities, based on our particular facts and circumstances. Our contracts and other arrangements may not meet an exception or a safe harbor. Additionally, many states have similar anti-kickback laws that are not necessarily limited to items or services for which payment is made by a federal healthcare program. In addition, federal laws restricting certain physician self-referrals (also known as the Stark Law), as well as state counterparts, may prohibit payment for patient referrals, patient brokering, remuneration of patients, or billing based on referrals between individuals or entities that have various financial, ownership, or other business relationships with physicians or other healthcare providers. The Stark Law is very complex, and state anti-referral laws vary widely. As noted below, to the extent we undertake billing and coding for designated health services, such activities may be subject to the Stark Law. 
 False or Fraudulent Claim Laws; Medical Billing and Coding 
 Medical billing, coding and collection activities are governed by numerous federal and state civil and criminal laws, regulations, and sub-regulatory guidance. We provide billing and coding services, claims processing and other solutions to providers that relate to, or directly involve, the reimbursement of health services covered by Medicare, Medicaid, other federal and state healthcare programs and private payers. In addition, as part of our data transmission and claims submission services, we may employ certain edits, using logic, mapping and defaults, when submitting claims to third-party payers. Such edits are utilized when the information received from providers is insufficient to complete individual data elements requested by payers. We also provide solutions including risk analytics, chart reviews, clinical care visits, payment accuracy, audit functions and enrollment and eligibility, to Medicaid and Medicare managed care plans, commercial plans and other entities. These solutions, which include identifying diagnosis codes with respect to hierarchical condition categories, impact the amounts paid by Medicare and Medicaid to managed care plans. In addition, solutions we offer to customers that enable customers to certify to compliance with certain requirements and standards, such as EHR Meaningful Use requirements. We rely on our customers to provide us with accurate and complete information and to appropriately use analytics, codes, reports and other information in connection with the solutions we provide to them, but they may not always do so. As a result of these aspects of our business, we may be subject to, or contractually required to comply with, numerous federal and state laws that prohibit false or fraudulent claims including but not limited to the FCA, the CMP, and state equivalents. 
 In addition, the FCA prohibits the knowing submission of false claims or statements to the federal government, including to the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The FCA also contains qui tam, or whistleblower provisions, which allow private individuals to sue on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has defrauded the federal government. 
 Exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs. We are also subject to the exclusion rules of the OIG of HHS whereby OIG may or must exclude individuals and entities convicted of program-related crimes from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. A company that employs or contracts with an OIG-excluded individual and submits a claim for reimbursement to a federal healthcare program, or causes such a claim to be submitted, may itself be excluded or may be subject to significant penalties under the CMP, plus treble damages, for each item or service furnished during the period in which the individual or entity was excluded. A company contracting with providers has an affirmative duty to check the exclusion status of individuals and entities prior to entering into employment or contractual relationships and periodically re-check thereafter, or run the risk of liability under the CMP.

 FDA and International Regulation of Medical Software 
 Certain of our products are classified as medical devices and are subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration (the FDA) and numerous other federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. In the U.S., the FDA permits commercial distribution of a new medical device after the device has received clearance under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the FDCA), or is the subject of an approved premarket approval application, unless the device is specifically exempt from those requirements. Moreover, the FDA has increasingly focused on the regulation of medical software and health information technology products as medical devices under the FDCA. For example, in February 2015, the FDA issued guidance to inform manufacturers and distributors of medical device data systems that it did not intend to enforce compliance with regulatory controls that apply to medical device data systems, medical image storage devices, and medical image communication devices. The Cures Act, enacted in December 2016, builds on the FDAs efforts to limit the regulation of low-risk medical devices by exempting certain categories of software functions from the definition of medical device under the FDCA, including software functions intended for administrative support of a healthcare facility and certain functions related to the exchange and use of electronic medical records. However, a software function may not be excluded from the device definition if the FDA determines that use of the software function would be reasonably likely to have serious adverse health consequences. 
 Foreign governmental authorities that regulate the manufacture and sale of medical devices have become increasingly stringent and, where we sell our medical device solutions internationally, we are subject to international regulation regarding these medical device solutions. For example, in May 2017, the EU Medical Devices Regulation (MDR) (Regulation 2017/745) was adopted and in May 2020 the MDR came into effect. The MDR repeals and replaces the EU Medical Devices Directive. Unlike directives, which must be implemented into the national laws of the EU Member States, the MDR is directly applicable in the EU Member States and on the basis of the European Economic Area (EEA) agreement in Iceland, Lichtenstein and Norway. The MDR, among other things, is intended to establish a uniform, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the EEA for medical devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation. The MDR, among other things: 
 

 | Strengthens the clinical data requirements related to medical devices;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Imposes additional scrutiny during the conformity assessment procedure for high risk medical devices;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Imposes on manufacturers and authorized representative the obligation to have a person responsible for regulatory compliance continuously at their disposal;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Requires that authorized representatives be held legally responsible and liable for defective products placed on the EEA market jointly with the device manufacturers;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Reinforces post market surveillance requirements applicable to CE marked medical devices;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Improves the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user or patient through a Unique Device Identification System; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Increases transparency. Information from several databases concerning economic operators, CE Certificates of Conformity, conformity assessment, clinical investigations, the Unique Device Identification system, adverse event reporting and market surveillance will be available to the public.

 Interoperability Requirements 
 There is increasing demand among customers, industry groups and government authorities that healthcare IT products provided by various vendors be compatible with each other and allow for the efficient exchange of EHR information. In 2013, in order to address this demand for interoperability, a number of other healthcare IT companies co-founded the CommonWell Health Alliance with the aim of developing a standard for data sharing among physicians, hospitals, clinics and pharmacies. Certain federal and state agencies also are developing standards that could eventually become mandatory for software and systems purchased by these agencies, or used by our customers. For example, under the Cures Act, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) within HHS is required to develop a trusted exchange framework and common agreement for the secure exchange of health information between networks. Although the Cures Act does not make implementation of the trusted exchange framework mandatory, the Cures Act encourages its adoption through the establishment of a publicly available directory of networks that are capable of trusted exchange and by permitting federal agencies to require implementation of the trusted exchange framework by network contractors as the contractors update their health IT or operational practices. 
 The Cures Act also encourages interoperability through changes to EHR certification standards implemented as part of HHSs programs to promote interoperability. In particular, the amended EHR certification standards will require developers (i) to publish application programming interfaces that permit exchange of EHR and other health information among different health IT systems, (ii) to successfully test the real world use of interoperability technology, and (iii) to attest that they will not engage in information blocking or otherwise inhibit the appropriate exchange, access, and use of electronic health information. 
 Restrictions on Communications 
 Communications with our customers and our customers patients are subject to laws and regulations governing communications, including the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (the TCPA), the CAN-SPAM Act, and additional fax regulations under the Junk Fax Act and data privacy rules under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as well as potentially under non-U.S. laws that regulate communications and messaging and that affect our operations, such as Canadas Anti-Spam Law (CASL), GDPR, and the European Unions e-Privacy Directive and implementing member state laws (and any subsequent changes to such laws). We also use email and social medial platforms as marketing tools. For example, we maintain social media accounts and may occasionally email customers offers and promotions. As laws and regulations, including FTC enforcement, rapidly evolve to govern the use of these platforms and devices, we will become subject to such laws and regulations. 
Financial Services Related Laws, Regulations and Industry Standards 
 Financial services and electronic payment processing services are subject to numerous laws, regulations and industry standards. These laws may subject us, our vendors and our customers to liability as a result of our communication and payment solutions. Although we do not act as a bank, we offer solutions that involve banks, or vendors who contract with banks and other regulated providers of financial services. We rely on relationships with such banks, vendors and providers. If we fail to maintain these relationships or if we maintain them under new terms that are less favorable to us, our business, results of operations or financial condition could suffer. The various payment modalities that we offer our customers directly and through banks, vendors, or other regulated providers may be deemed regulated activity at the federal or state level, and, as a result, we may be affected by banking and financial services industry laws, regulations and standards, such as licensing requirements, solvency standards, reporting and disclosure obligations and requirements to maintain the privacy and security of nonpublic personal financial information. In addition, our communication and payment solutions may be affected by payment card industry operating rules and security standards, certification requirements, state prompt payment laws and other rules governing electronic funds transfers. Moreover, in addition to regulatory requirements related to electronic funds transfers, payment transactions processed using the Automated Clearing 
 
26 


  House Network are subject to network operating rules promulgated by the National Automated Clearing House Association, and these rules may affect our payment practices. Certain payment transactions may be subject to card association and network rules and standards. Finally, as we expand our financial services offerings we may be subject to additional laws and regulations, including certain consumer protection laws such as the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act (the FDCPA), the Fair Credit Reporting Act (the FCRA) and various other state laws implicated by such financial services. 
 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and Bribery Laws 
 The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and similar international bribery laws make it unlawful for entities to make payments to foreign government officials to assist in obtaining and maintaining business. Specifically, the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA prohibit any offer, payment, promise to pay, or authorizing the payment of money or anything of value to any person, while knowing that all or a portion of such money or thing of value will be offered, given or promised, directly or indirectly, to a foreign official to do or omit to do an act in violation of his or her duty, or to secure any improper advantage in order to assist in obtaining or retaining business for or with, or directing business, to any person. In addition to the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA, the statute also contains accounting requirements designed to operate in tandem with the anti-bribery provisions. Covered companies are required to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the company and devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. 
Physician Payments Sunshine Act 
 The Physician Payments Sunshine Act of 2010 (the Sunshine Act) requires manufacturers of medical devices covered by Medicare, Medicaid, and the Childrens Health Insurance Program to collect and track all financial relationships with physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually such data to CMS. Medical device manufacturers must report to CMS payments or transfers of value made to physicians, including meals, travel reimbursement, consulting fees and research payments. In addition, several states and the District of Columbia have passed laws requiring that medical device manufacturers report various details of their financial relationships with physicians. The Sunshine Act authorizes significant civil monetary penalties for each payment or transfer of value not accurately or completely reported. 
Payment Card Industry Standards 
 We accept credit card, eCheck, ACH Payments, and payments via online portal, phone/Interactive Voice Response system or by mail. We also enable payers to collect member premium payments. These transactions are regulated at the federal, state and international levels as well as by certain industry groups, such as the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council, the National Automated Clearing House Association and individual credit card issuers. Federal, state, international and industry groups also may consider and implement from time to time new privacy and security requirements that apply to our business. Compliance with contractual obligations and evolving privacy and security laws, requirements and regulations may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes, new limitations or constraints on our business and the development of new administrative processes. If we fail to adequately control fraudulent ACH, credit card and debit card transactions, we may face civil liability, diminished public perception of our security measures and significantly higher ACH, credit card and debit card related costs, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The termination of our ability to process payments through ACH transactions or on any major credit or debit card would adversely affect our ability to operate our business. 
Other State Healthcare Laws 
 Many states in which we provide clinical care in-home assessment services prohibit corporations and other non-licensed entities from practicing medicine, nursing and other licensed professions by employing physicians and certain non-physician practitioners. These prohibitions on the corporate practice of medicine, nursing and 
 
27 


  other licensed professions impact how we structure our relationships with physicians and other affected non-physician practitioners. In addition, some states have restrictions on physicians and other healthcare practitioners splitting fees with non-practitioners or restrict the ability of practitioners to assign claims for reimbursement from government healthcare programs. Some states have interpreted these laws to prevent business service providers from charging their physician clients on the basis of a percentage of collections or charges. Furthermore, we hold certain state licenses and enrollments in government healthcare programs which subject us to additional requirements and scrutiny by government regulators. 
 Intellectual Property 
 The Company relies upon a combination of trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, patents, license agreements, confidentiality policies and procedures, nondisclosure agreements and technical measures designed to protect the intellectual property and commercially valuable confidential information and data used in its business. The Company generally enters into nondisclosure agreements with our employees, consultants, vendors and customers. It also seeks to control access to and distribution of its technology, documentation and other proprietary information. 
 The Company uses numerous trademarks, trade names and service marks for its solutions and has a number of patents and patent applications covering solutions it provides, including software applications. However, the Company does not believe its solutions are dependent upon any one patent or patent application, or family or families of the same. It also licenses from third parties a variety of content, data and other intellectual property. Although we believes that alternative technologies and work-arounds are likely to be available should these agreements terminate or expire, there is no guarantee that third-party technologies will continue to be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or that work-arounds would be readily available for deployment on a commercially reasonable time-frame. 
 The steps the Company has taken to protect its trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, patents and other intellectual property may not be adequate, and third parties could infringe, misappropriate or misuse its intellectual property. If this were to occur, it could harm the Companys reputation and adversely affect its competitive position or results of operations. 
 Employees 
 As of March 31, 2020, we had approximately 15,000 employees. None of these employees are represented by a labor union. We consider our relationships with our employees to be good. 
Seasonality 
 The nature of the Companys customers end-market results in moderate seasonality reflected in revenue differences during the year with a slightly greater positive variance in our fiscal fourth quarter related to the regulatory impact of data submission deadlines due to HEDIS, which may drive timing of analytics activity. Following the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance on April 1, 2019, the Company believes that the moderate seasonality will continue to be reflected in its financial results but with potentially differing patterns than under the prior recognition method. Finally, quarter to quarter financial performance may vary from historical seasonal trends as the Company further expands and diversifies its business and increases the portion of its revenue generated from new offerings.
