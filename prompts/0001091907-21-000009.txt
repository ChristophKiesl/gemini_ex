Item 1. Business
World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. is an integrated media and entertainment company. "WWE" refers to World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires. References to "we," "us," "our" and the "Company" refer to WWE. The initials "WWE" and our stylized and iconic "W" logo are two of our trademarks. This report also contains other WWE trademarks and trade names as well as those of other companies. All trademarks and trade names appearing in this report are the property of their respective holders.
We have been involved in the sports entertainment business for four decades, and have developed WWE into one of the most popular brands in global entertainment today. We are principally engaged in the production and distribution of unique and creative content through various channels, including the premium over-the-top subscription network (“WWE Network”), content rights agreements, pay-per-view event programming, filmed entertainment, live events, licensing of various WWE themed products, and the sale of consumer products featuring our brands. At the heart of our success are the athletic and entertainment skills and appeal of our Superstars, and our consistently innovative and multi-faceted storylines. Our distribution platforms provide significant cross-promotion and marketing opportunities that reinforce our brands while effectively reaching our fans.
Based on the strength of the Company’s brands and its ownership and control over its intellectual property, the Company has been able to leverage its content and talent globally across virtually all media platforms. We continually evaluate additional opportunities to monetize new and existing content, including WWE Network, which is available in all international markets other than embargoed countries. In this regard, we recently announced a multi-year agreement with Peacock TV LLC, an affiliate of NBC Universal (“NBCU”) which operates the Peacock paid streaming service (“Peacock”). This agreement grants, among other things, the exclusive domestic streaming and video-on-demand rights to WWE Network content via Peacock, as well as certain WWE Network subscriber data. 
Our operations are organized around the following principal activities:
Media:
The Media segment reflects the production and monetization of long-form and short-form video content across various platforms, including WWE Network, broadcast and pay television, digital and social media, as well as filmed entertainment. Across these platforms, revenues principally consist of content rights fees, subscriptions to WWE Network, and advertising and sponsorships. Effective March 18, 2021, the domestic monetization of WWE Network will be generated from content license fees and certain shared sponsorship revenues from NBCU.
Live Events:
Live events provide ongoing content for our media platforms. Live Event segment revenues consist primarily of ticket sales, including primary and secondary distribution, revenues from events for which we receive a fixed fee, as well as the sale of travel packages associated with the Company’s global live events. As a result of the global spread of the coronavirus pandemic (“COVID-19”), these revenues were greatly limited in 2020 and we expect this pattern to continue into 2021 for an indeterminate period.
Consumer Products:
The Consumer Products segment engages in the merchandising of WWE branded products, such as video games, toys and apparel, through licensing arrangements and direct-to-consumer sales. Revenues principally consist of royalties and licensee fees related to WWE branded products, and sales of merchandise distributed at our live events and through eCommerce platforms.
Media
Media net revenues were $868.2 million, $743.1 million and $683.4 million, representing 89%, 77% and 73% of total net revenues in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Network
WWE Network launched in February 2014, becoming the first-ever 24/7 live streaming direct-to-consumer network. This subscription-based network is currently available in all international markets other than embargoed countries, including the United Kingdom, Canada, the Middle East, China and Australia, among others. Subscribers can access all of WWE’s live pay-per-view events, exclusive original programming and over 13,000 hours of our video-on-demand library. The inclusion of our monthly marquis pay-per-view events, including WrestleMania, and the access to original content and live specials are critical components of the programming which drives our viewer engagement and satisfaction. WWE Network content includes exclusive original programming, groundbreaking 

 

documentaries, reality shows and in-ring specials, including Undertaker: The Last Ride, Steve Austin’s Broken Skull Sessions and WWE Untold. Our strategy of creating compelling original content for broadcast on WWE Network has contributed to the popularity of WWE Network, which premiered nearly 350 hours of original content during 2020. 
WWE Network is available on select gaming consoles, computers, mobile devices, internet connected TVs, and popular digital media players. As of December 31, 2020, WWE Network had 1,469,700 paid subscribers as compared to 1,391,000 paid subscribers at December 31, 2019, representing a 6% increase in our subscriber base. For domestic subscribers, the current subscription pricing of WWE Network is $9.99 per month with no minimum commitment. 
In connection with the new multi-year agreement with NBCU beginning on March 18, 2021, the content licensed via Peacock will include WWE’s pay-per-view content, second runs of our in-ring television programming, original and archival content, as well as new WWE Network content.
Core Content Rights Fees
Leveraging our expertise in live event television production, we currently produce seven hours of original weekly domestic television programming, RAW, SmackDown and NXT, our core content. RAW and NXT are licensed domestically under multi-year contracts with NBCU, while SmackDown is licensed domestically under a multi-year contract with Fox Network. Second runs of RAW and SmackDown are also available on WWE Network 30 days after the original first run airing dates on television.
RAW is a three-hour live primetime program which ranks among the most watched regularly scheduled programs on primetime cable television. RAW remains the longest running weekly episodic program in primetime television history, with over 1,400 original episodes, and anchors USA Network’s programming line-up, consistently helping make it the top-rated cable entertainment network.
SmackDown is a two-hour live primetime program airing on Fridays on Fox Network. SmackDown continues to be the second longest running weekly episodic program in primetime TV history, second only to RAW. 
NXT is a two-hour live primetime program airing on Wednesday nights on USA Network. The weekly program continues to air on WWE Network shortly after the initial run on USA Network.
WWE’s TV-PG, family-friendly television programming, including RAW and SmackDown, can be seen in more than 900 million homes and in 28 languages around the world. Our international broadcast partners currently include: BT Sport in the United Kingdom; Sony Ten in India, Rogers Communication in Canada, and PP Sports in China, among many others. 
Advertising and Sponsorships
WWE utilizes the Internet and social media platforms to promote our brands, market and distribute our content and digital products, create a community experience among our fans and sell advertising across these various platforms. WWE currently streams its media content on select social media platforms, such as YouTube and Facebook. WWE surpassed 70 million subscribers on YouTube, and consistently ranks among the top viewed channels, with over 21 billion views of WWE content in 2020. The Company also receives advertising revenues from YouTube and Facebook based on viewership data of our content. In 2020, WWE had over 1.3 billion social media fan engagements across social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram and Tumblr.
Our primary website, WWE.com, attracted an average of over 6 million monthly unique visitors worldwide during 2020. These visitors viewed an average of 67 million pages and 6 million video streams per month. WWE short-form video and other content is available through our mobile partnerships. WWE currently has local language-based websites allowing fans to experience WWE in their native language with a concentration on local events and shows. Currently, the available languages are English, Spanish, Mandarin, French, German, Polish and Arabic. We monetize our digital advertising inventory on WWE.com in global markets via programmatic ad sales and relationships with sales agencies.
In addition, through our sponsorship packages, we offer advertisers a full range of our promotional opportunities, including online and print advertising, on-air announcements and special appearances by our Superstars. These opportunities allow our advertisers and sponsors to engage consumers across a variety of our platforms. In 2020, we grew several partnerships with blue-chip brands, including Hyundai, Mars, Coca-Cola, Unilever, Microsoft and Nestle Waters, and partnered with new advertisers, such as Constellation Brands, Foster Farms, Credit One and Progressive Insurance. Our sponsors promote their products utilizing our digital media assets, including promotion on WWE.com as well as promotion through WWE Network and through our live events. As part of our recently announced agreement with NBCU, sales of certain sponsorships on their platform will be shared by both parties.

Other
Our Media segment also generates revenue from the distribution of other WWE content, including, but not limited to, certain live in-ring programming content in international markets, scripted, reality and other programming, as well as theatrical and direct-to-home video releases. 
Our reality-based television series currently includes Total Bellas, and Miz and Mrs. Total Bellas, a spinoff of our hit series, Total Divas, was added to WWE's programming line-up in October 2016, and launched a sixth season in November 2020. This reality-based series airing on E! gives viewers exclusive access into the lives of The Bella Twins and their family. Previous episodes of Seasons 1 through 5 are also replayed on WWE Network.
Miz & Mrs., a docuseries chronicling the lives of WWE Superstars The Miz and Maryse, premiered in July 2018 on USA Network. Following the success of the initial six episodes of this reality-based series, USA Network picked up 14 more episodes, which aired during 2019. Season 2 of the series premiered in January 2020. Previous episodes of Season 1 are also replayed on WWE Network. 
WWE Studios is our multi-platform production company that develops and produces feature films, television (scripted, non-scripted), and digital content. In 2020, WWE Studios secured partnerships for films, animated content, unscripted formats, scripted series and documentaries on a variety of platforms, including Netflix, A&E, Universal Television and other domestic and international platforms. 
Live Events
Live Events net revenues were $19.9 million, $125.6 million and $144.2 million, representing 2%, 13% and 16% of total net revenues in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Our broad and talented roster of Superstars allows us to perform in numerous domestic markets and take advantage of the strong international demand for our events. Live events and the associated programming produced at our live events are our principal creative content and production activities. Our creative team develops compelling and complex characters and weaves them into dynamic storylines that combine physical and emotional elements. Storylines are usually played out in the ring and unfold on our weekly television shows, culminating in our monthly marquis events which air on WWE Network and are also available via pay-per-view.
The global spread of COVID-19 and the various attempts to contain it have resulted in restrictions, postponements and cancellations of various events, such as the relocation of WrestleMania 36 and the cancellation of ticketed events due to public health concerns. The impact of COVID-19 was significant on our live events segment, which is highly dependent on ticket sales at our live events. We expect this pattern to continue into 2021 for an indeterminate period as we continue to monitor the developments of COVID-19 and actively manage our business to respond to these and other potential impacts.
North American Ticket Sales
In 2020, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we produced 41 live events (excluding NXT) throughout North America, entertaining 259,000 fans at an average ticket price of $53.46. We held many of these live events at major arenas across the country. In addition to providing content for our television and other programming, these events provide us with a real-time assessment of the popularity of our storylines and characters.
International Ticket Sales
In 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we were unable to generate any ticket sales related to international events. We held one large-scale international event in 2020, for which we received a fixed fee.
Consumer Products
Consumer Products net revenues were $86.1 million, $91.7 million and $102.6 million, representing 9%, 10% and 11% of total net revenues in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Consumer Product Licensing
We have established a worldwide licensing program using our marks and logos, copyrighted works and characters on a large variety of retail products, including video games, toys, apparel and books. Currently, we have relationships with more than 200 licensees worldwide that provide products for sale at major retailers. To maintain the distinctive style and quality of our intellectual property and brand, we retain creative approval over the design, packaging, advertising and promotional materials associated with these products. Additionally, we continually seek new opportunities to partner with best-in-class organizations to develop new products for our fans and further expand our licensing business. 

 


Video games and toys are the largest components of our licensing program. We have a comprehensive, multi-year licensing agreement with Mattel, Inc., our master toy licensee, covering all global territories, and a multi-year licensing agreement with Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. ("Take-Two") to produce and sell our branded console video games. WWE branded video games currently include WWE 2K and WWE Battlegrounds, available on PlayStation and XBOX platforms and on iOS and Android devices, and WWE SuperCard, available on iOS and Android devices. The video game industry continues to migrate the availability of video games toward downloadable content through an Internet connected device. Accordingly, our video games can be downloaded via the Internet and contain subsequent downloadable content that can be purchased to add additional characters and game modes to enhance game play.
Music is an integral part of the WWE entertainment experience. We compose and record music, including Superstar entrance themes, in our recording studio. In addition to our own composed music, we license music performed by popular artists.
eCommerce
WWEShop is our direct-to-consumer e-commerce storefront. WWE merchandise is also distributed on other domestic and international e-commerce platforms, including Amazon. We processed 722,300 orders during 2020 as compared to 619,700 in 2019, driven, in part, by the release of new replica title belts and changes in consumer spending habits as a result of COVID-19.
Venue Merchandise
Our direct-to-consumer venue merchandise business consists of the design, sourcing, marketing and distribution of numerous WWE-branded products such as t-shirts, belts, caps and other novelty items, all of which feature our Superstars and/or logos.
The impact of COVID-19 was significant on our venue merchandise results, which are highly dependent on purchases of merchandise by consumers at our live events. We expect this pattern to continue into 2021 for an indeterminate period as we continue to monitor the developments of COVID-19 and actively manage our business to respond to the ongoing impacts.
Customers
Our customers include content distributors of our media content through their networks and platforms, fans who purchase tickets to our live events, purchase our merchandise at venues or online through our eCommerce platforms and subscribers to WWE Network, advertisers and sponsors, consumer product licensees, and film distributors/buyers. As noted elsewhere, we have several important partners, including NBCU and its affiliates who, among other things, carry the domestic television distribution of Raw and NXT, and, beginning in March 2021, will carry the exclusive domestic streaming rights of WWE Network content. We also partner with Fox Network who carries the domestic television distribution of SmackDown, and the General Entertainment Authority of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia who, among other things, hosts our live events in the Middle East.
Creative Development and Production
Headed by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Vincent K. McMahon, our creative team develops compelling and complex characters and weaves them into dynamic storylines that combine physical and emotional elements. Storylines are usually played out in the ring and unfold on our weekly television shows, culminating in our monthly marquis events. We voluntarily designate the suitability of each of our television shows using standard industry ratings, and all our in-ring television programming carries a PG rating, which is critical to maintaining the Company’s reputation for family friendly entertainment.
Our success is due primarily to the continuing popularity of our Superstars. We have nearly 300 Superstars under exclusive contracts, ranging from multi-year guaranteed contracts with established Superstars to developmental contracts with our Superstars in training. Our Superstars are highly trained and motivated independent contractors, whose compensation is tied to the revenue that they help generate. We own the rights to substantially all our characters and exclusively license the rights we do not own through agreements with our Superstars.
Talent Development
We continually seek to identify, recruit and develop additional talent for our business. Our development system, including the NXT division, features talent training to become WWE Superstars and has produced over 85% of our current active main roster stars, such as Roman Reigns, Sasha Banks, The Street Profits, Otis, and Bianca Belair. NXT has now evolved into our third brand after Raw and SmackDown and has transitioned into a weekly live television series. Prior to COVID-19, NXT was also a global touring brand broadcasting live specials on WWE Network. Approximately 60% of our developmental talent come from more than 20 countries outside the U.S., including the United Kingdom, China, India, Japan, Australia, Ireland, Brazil and Germany. Women comprise approximately 30% of our developmental talent. NXT talent train at our WWE Performance Center in Florida, a state-of-the-art training facility, which was designed to cultivate our next generation of talent and has become the center of our talent development program. In efforts to localize our content around the world, we opened the WWE UK Performance Center in January 2019, the first WWE training facility outside of the United States. 

Competition
While we believe that we have a loyal fan base, the entertainment industry is highly competitive and subject to fluctuations in popularity, which are not easy to predict. For our live event and media content audiences, we face competition from professional and college sports, other live, filmed, televised and streamed entertainment, which includes other professional wrestling leagues, and other leisure activities. We will face increased competition from websites and mobile and other internet connected apps delivering paid and free content as streamed media offerings continue to expand. For purchases of our merchandise, we compete with entertainment companies, professional and college sports leagues and other makers of branded apparel and merchandise. Many companies with whom we compete have greater financial resources than we do.
Trademarks and Copyrights
Intellectual property is material to all aspects of our operations, and we expend substantial cost and effort in an attempt to maintain and protect our intellectual property and to maintain compliance vis-à-vis other parties’ intellectual property. We have a large portfolio of registered and unregistered trademarks and service marks worldwide and maintain a large catalog of copyrighted works, including copyrights in our television and WWE Network programming, music, photographs, books, films and apparel art. We also own a large number of internet website domain names and operate a network of developed, content-based sites, which facilitate and contribute to the exploitation of our intellectual property worldwide.
We vigorously seek to enforce our intellectual property rights worldwide by, among other things, searching the internet to ascertain unauthorized use, seizing counterfeit goods and seeking restraining orders and/or damages in court against individuals or entities infringing our intellectual property rights. Our failure or inability to curtail piracy, infringement or other unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights effectively, or our infringement of others’ intellectual property rights, could adversely affect our operating results.
Human Capital
The human capital objectives we focus on in managing our business include attracting, developing, and retaining key personnel. Our employees are critical to the success of our organization and the Company is committed to supporting our employees’ professional development. We believe our management team has the experience necessary to effectively implement our growth strategy and continue to drive shareholder value. We provide competitive compensation and benefits to attract and retain key personnel, while also providing a safe, inclusive and respectful workplace. The Company develops personnel by offering in-house learning and development resources that include online and in-person training programs on a variety of topics, including topics that advance leadership skills.
We currently have over 900 full-time employees. Our in-house production staff is supplemented with contract personnel for our television production who are not included in our headcount. We believe the relationship between WWE and our employees is strong. Our employee headcount also excludes our Superstars and NXT talent, who are independent contractors. 
Regulation
Live Events
In some United States and foreign jurisdictions, athletic commissions and other applicable regulatory agencies require us to obtain licenses for promoters, medical clearances and/or other permits or licenses for performers and/or permits for events in order for us to promote and conduct our live events. If we fail to comply with the regulations of a particular jurisdiction, we may be prohibited from promoting and conducting our live events in that jurisdiction. The inability to present our live events over an extended period of time, especially after the hiatus resulting from COVID-19, or in a number of jurisdictions could lead to a decline in the various revenue streams generated from our live events, which could adversely affect our operating results.
Television and WWE Network Programming
The marketplace for audio-visual programming (including cable television and Internet programming) in the United States and internationally is substantially affected by government regulations applicable to, as well as social and political influences on, television stations, television networks and cable and satellite television systems and channels. Certain Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) regulations are imposed directly on the Company and/or indirectly through our distributors. Other domestic and foreign governmental and private-sector initiatives relating to video programming are announced from time to time. In addition, the delivery of WWE Network in international markets exposes us to multiple regulatory frameworks, the complexity of which may result in unintentional noncompliance. One of our weekly television programs, SmackDown, is distributed via broadcast television on the Fox Network, and we are responsible, directly or indirectly, for compliance with certain additional FCC regulations and statutory requirements. Any failure by us to meet these governmental policies or regulations and private-sector expectations could restrict our program content and, in the case of government regulation, result in monetary liability. Such failure could also adversely affect our levels of viewership and/or number of WWE Network subscribers. Any of these could affect our operating results.
