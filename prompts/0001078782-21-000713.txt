ITEM 1: 
BUSINESS

On October 4, 2017, the Company changed its name from Line Up Advertisement, Inc. to Tactical Services, Inc.
 
On October 23, 2017, Tactical Services, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the “Company” or “TTSI”) entered into an Asset Acquisition Agreement (the “Original Agreement”) with Thomas Li, an individual (“Mr. Li”) and Nathan Xian, an individual (“Mr. Xian”) (collectively Mr. Li and Mr. Xian are refereed to hereinafter as the “Inventors”). TTSI was to purchase various assets owned by the Inventors relating the development, sales, marketing and distribution of Unmanned Ariel Vehicles (“UAV” or “Drones”). Pursuant to the Original Agreement, the Company was to acquire one hundred percent (100%) of the assets then owned by the Inventors in exchange for the issuance of an aggregate of 60,000,000 restricted shares of the Company’s common stock (“TTSI Shares”) to the Inventors.
 
However, on August 24, 2018, the Company and the Inventors entered into a Termination Agreement (the “Termination Agreement”), terminating the Original Agreement. The Termination Agreement was the direct result of a material breach of the terms and conditions of the Original Agreement. Specifically, the Inventors, pursuant to Section 2.01 of the Original Agreement, were to “sell, transfer, convey, assign and deliver…” various assets to the Company. As of the date of termination, the Inventors have been unsuccessful in fulfilling their obligations under the terms and conditions of the Original Agreement. The effect of the Termination Agreement is that the Original Agreement is rendered null and void and shall have no legal effect whatsoever, without any liability or obligation on the part of any party to the Original Agreement. 
 
The Agreement contained a post-closing condition such that the Company’s majority shareholder cancelled 50,000,000 shares of the Company’s restricted common stock then currently beneficially owned, such stock was cancelled and returned to the Company’s treasury.
 
The foregoing summary is a description of the terms of the Original Agreement and the Termination Agreement which may not contain all information that is of interest to the reader. For further information regarding specific terms and conditions of the Original Agreement and the Termination Agreement which were filed with the SEC on October 25, 2017, as Exhibit 10.01 to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K and on August 28, 2018, as Exhibit 10.02 to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K respectively, both of which are incorporated herein by this reference.

We are currently seeking acquisition partners we believe would be beneficial for the Company and our shareholders. To this end, we intent to begin the process of identifying sectors and industries that current management believes will provide the most long-term and short-term benefit to the existing and future shareholders of the Company. However, as of the date of this Report we have not identified any potential acquisition candidates or entered into any negotiations relating to the same. Additionally, we intend to continue to take such corporate actions necessary to fulfill our reporting obligations with the SEC and undertaking other corporate actions necessary to continue and eventually grow the Company’s business operations, through the identification of suitable acquisition partners. We intend to update our shareholders during this process. 
 
On June 1, 2021, our board of directors approved changing our corporate name from Tactical Services, Inc. to CGS International, Inc. Additionally, on June 1, 2021, our Board of Directors approved a reverse stock split of our issued and authorized shares of common stock on the basis of 400 old shares for one (1) new share. When approved, our issued and outstanding capital will decrease from 76,000,000 shares of common stock to 190,000 shares of common stock. The $0.001 par value of our common shares will remain unchanged. 
 
The resolutions of our Board of Directors approving the above described reverse stock split and name change are subject to the prior approval by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).
