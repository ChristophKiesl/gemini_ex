ITEM 1.   BUSINESS

Monitronics International, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, "Monitronics" or the "Company", doing business as "Brinks Home SecurityTM") provides residential customers and commercial client accounts with monitored home and business security systems, as well as multiple home automation, life safety and advanced security options, in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico. Our principal executive office is located at 1990 Wittington Place, Farmers Branch, Texas, telephone number (972) 243-7443. We were wholly-owned subsidiaries of Ascent Capital Group, Inc. ("Ascent Capital") until August 30, 2019.
On June 30, 2019, Monitronics and certain of its domestic subsidiaries (collectively, the "Debtors"), filed voluntary petitions for relief (collectively, the "Petitions" and, the cases commenced thereby, the "Chapter 11 Cases") under chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code (the "Bankruptcy Code") in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas (the "Bankruptcy Court"). The Debtors' Chapter 11 Cases were jointly administered under the caption In re Monitronics International, Inc., et al., Case No. 19-33650. On August 7, 2019, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order, Docket No. 199 (the "Confirmation Order"), confirming and approving the Debtors' Joint Partial Prepackaged Plan of Reorganization (including all exhibits thereto and, as modified by the Confirmation order, the "Plan") that was previously filed with the Bankruptcy Court on June 30, 2019. On August 30, 2019 (the "Effective Date"), the conditions to the effectiveness of the Plan were satisfied and the Company emerged from Chapter 11 after completing a series of transactions through which the Company and its former parent, Ascent Capital, merged (the "Merger") in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of May 24, 2019 (the "Merger Agreement"). Monitronics was the surviving corporation and, immediately following the Merger, was redomiciled in Delaware in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement.
Recent Events
De-Registration under the Exchange Act
The Company’s Board has determined that due to the significant costs of operating as a public reporting company, the substantial time that being a public reporting company required of our management team and the availability of an option to suspend our public reporting obligations in accordance with SEC rules, we determined that it would be in the best interest of our stockholders and our company to file a Form 15 with the SEC to suspend our public reporting filing responsibilities. Once we file the Form 15, our obligation to file reports and other information under the Exchange Act, such as Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K, will be immediately suspended. This will result in less information about the Company being available to stockholders and investors immediately following the filing of the Form 15 and may negatively affect the liquidity, trading volume and trading price of our common stock. It is expected that the deregistration of our common stock under the Exchange Act will become effective ninety (90) days after the date on which the Form 15 is filed. Following the de-registration, our common stock will be quoted on the OTC Pink Open Market (the “Pink Sheets”), a centralized electronic quotation service for over-the-counter securities, so long as market makers demonstrate an interest in trading in our common stock. However, we can give no assurance that trading in our common stock will continue on the Pink Sheets or any other securities exchange or quotation medium.
Select Security Transaction
On December 23, 2020, the Company completed a transaction (the "Select Security Transaction") to acquire approximately 32,000 residential and small business and 8,000 large commercial alarm monitoring contracts from Kourt Security Partners, LLC, doing business as Select Security (the "Seller"). The Company will take ownership of the alarm monitoring contracts through an earnout structure that includes a $10,914,000 upfront payment and a 50-month earnout period (the "Earnout Period"). Per the terms of the Select Security Transaction, the Seller transferred title of the monitoring contracts and other certain business assets to GS Security Alarm LLC ("GSSA"). GSSA is a bankruptcy-remote special purpose vehicle designed only to transact the sale of subscriber accounts and related assets to the Company. The Company was significantly involved in the design of GSSA; however, the Company does not own any equity interest in GSSA. GSSA transferred the specified business assets to the Company immediately after close as well as a certain subset of the monitoring contracts. Title to the remaining monitoring contracts will transfer from GSSA to the Company during the Earnout Period with title to all of the monitoring contracts transferred by month 50. The Company also signed a monitoring services agreement with GSSA that establishes the Company as the sole and exclusive service provider for all of the subscriber accounts regardless of legal ownership during the 50-month period. The Company is retaining the majority of the Seller's Commercial Sales, Field Technicians and Customer Service employees, as well as certain office locations. For 90 days after the close, the Seller will provide transition services to the Company. 
Protect America Transaction
On June 17, 2020, the Company acquired title to over 110,000 contracts for the provision of alarm monitoring and related services (the "Accounts") as well as the related accounts receivable, intellectual property and equipment inventory of Protect America, Inc. The Company paid approximately $16,600,000 at closing and will make 50 subsequent monthly payments consisting of a portion of the revenue attributable to the Accounts, subject to adjustment for Accounts that are no longer active ("Earnout Payments" will here to be defined as contingent payments to acquire subscriber accounts under the Select Security and Protect America transactions).

Narrative Description of Business
We are one of the largest security alarm monitoring companies in North America, with customers under contract in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Canada. We offer:
•monitoring services for alarm signals arising from burglaries, fires, medical alerts and other events through security systems at our customers' premises;
•a comprehensive platform of home automation and life safety services, including, among other things, remote activation and control of security systems, support for video monitoring, flood sensors, automated garage door and door lock capabilities and thermostat integration;
•hands-free two-way interactive voice communication between our monitoring center and our customers; and
•customer service and technical support related to home monitoring systems and home automation services.
Our business model consists of two principal sales channels with customers sourced through our Network Sales Channel, which includes our authorized dealer network, and our Direct to Consumer Channel, which sources customers through direct-to-consumer advertising primarily through internet, print and partnership program marketing activities. From time to time, we also acquire new customers through negotiated bulk account acquisitions. Additionally, with the recent completion of the Select Security Transaction, the Company anticipates leveraging and growing the Select Security large commercial business.
Our Network Sales Channel is made up of our authorized dealer program and a growing authorized representative program. The authorized dealer program, which we consider exclusive based on our right of first refusal with respect to any accounts generated by such dealers, is our largest source of customers, representing 78% of gross additional customers during the year ended December 31, 2020, when excluding negotiated bulk account acquisitions in the period. Similarly, the authorized representative program outsources the sales and installation of our security offerings to a third party contractor sales team, but the Company retains the contractual relationship with the customer from the onset. Outsourcing a portion of the low margin, high fixed-cost elements of our business to a large network of dealers and representatives allows flexibility in managing our cost structure. 
Our Direct to Consumer Channel is an important element of our channel diversity strategy. Our Direct to Consumer Channel accounted for 22% of our gross additional customers during the year ended December 31, 2020, when excluding negotiated bulk account acquisitions in the period. Our Direct to Consumer Channel provides customers with both a DIY installation option and a professional installation option. While our future strategy will be more focused on professional installation, our DIY offering provides an asset-light, geographically-unconstrained product. In contrast to our Network Sales Channel with local market presence, our Direct to Consumer Channel generates accounts through leads from direct response marketing and partnerships with direct marketing and other subscription based businesses. Additionally, the Company has been developing an employee based Field Sales team and has successfully launched in several major geographical areas. 
We generate nearly all of our revenue from fees charged to customers (or "subscribers") under alarm monitoring agreements ("AMAs"), which include access to home automation, life safety and advanced security features for additional fees. During the year ended December 31, 2020, 98% of new customers purchased at least one of our these services alongside traditional security monitoring services. As of December 31, 2020, we had 933,620 subscribers generating $41,500,000 of Recurring Monthly Revenue ("RMR").
We generate incremental revenue through product and installation sales or by providing additional services, such as maintenance and wholesale contract monitoring. Contract monitoring includes fees charged to other security alarm companies for monitoring their accounts on a wholesale basis. As of December 31, 2020, we provided wholesale monitoring services for approximately 48,000 accounts. The incremental revenue streams do not represent a significant portion of our overall revenue.
Network Sales Channel
Our Network Sales Channel consists of 185 independent dealers and approximately 55 authorized representatives. Independent authorized dealers are typically small businesses that sell and install alarm systems. Authorized dealers generally do not retain the AMAs due to the scale and large upfront investment required to build and efficiently operate monitoring stations and the related infrastructure. Authorized dealers typically sell the AMAs to third parties and outsource the monitoring function for any AMAs they retain. Authorized representatives are generally individual sales consultants or a small teams of sales consultants that conduct their own sales and marketing efforts to contract the Company for both the sales and installation of equipment and the ongoing AMA with subscribers directly. 
The initial contract term for subscribers generated by the Network Sales Channel are three to five years, with automatic renewals annually or on a month-to-month basis depending on state and local regulations. We have the ability to monitor signals from a significant majority of residential security systems.
We generally enter into exclusive contracts with authorized dealers and representatives that typically have initial terms ranging between one and five years, with renewal terms thereafter. In order to maximize revenue and geographic diversification, we partner with dealers and representatives from throughout the U.S. We believe our ability to maximize return on invested capital is largely dependent on the quality of our dealers and representatives and the accounts acquired. Rigorous underwriting standards are applied to, and a detailed review is conducted of, each AMA to be acquired.

We generally acquire each new AMA at a cost based on a multiple of the account's RMR. Authorized dealer contracts generally provide that if an acquired AMA is terminated within the first 12 months, the dealer must replace the AMA or refund the AMA purchase price. To secure the dealer's obligation, we typically retain a percentage of the AMA purchase price.
Network Development

We remain focused on expanding our network of independent authorized dealers and representatives. To do so, we have established programs that provides participants with a variety of support services to assist them as they grow their businesses. Authorized dealers are encouraged to use the Brinks Home Security brand name in their sales and marketing activities and on the products they sell and install. Authorized representatives are required to use the Brinks Home Security brand name in their sales and marketing activities. Authorized dealers and representatives benefit from their affiliation with us and our national reputation for high customer satisfaction, as well as the support they receive from us. 
We offer our authorized dealers and representatives a marketing support program that is focused on developing professionally designed sales and marketing materials that will help market alarm systems and monitoring services with maximum effectiveness. All materials provided focus on the Brinks Home Security brand and our role as the single source of support for the customer. We believe that the use of our brand to promote affiliation with one of the nation's largest alarm monitoring companies boosts the dealers' and representatives' credibility and reputation in their local markets and also assists in supporting their sales success.
We also make available sales, business and technical training, sales literature, co-branded marketing materials, sales leads and management support to our authorized dealers and representatives.  In most cases, these services and cost savings would not be available to security alarm dealers and representatives on an individual basis.
We employ a team of individuals to promote our Network Sales programs and find account acquisition opportunities. We target independent alarm dealers and sales representatives across the U.S. that can benefit from our program services and can generate high quality monitoring customers for us. We use a variety of marketing techniques to promote our programs and related services. These activities include direct mail, trade magazine advertising, trade shows, internet web site marketing, publicity and telemarketing.
Direct to Consumer Channel
Through the Direct to Consumer Channel, we offer professionally installed or DIY home security and automation solutions coupled with alarm monitoring security services. The Direct to Consumer Channel obtains subscribers through a trained inside sales phone operation, our developing employee Field Sales teams, e-commerce online sales and partnership programs with marketing or other subscription based businesses. We sell the equipment and installation services, if applicable, to new customers with a monthly rate for monitoring and home automation services. Further, we offer third party financing to qualifying customers for the up-front equipment and installation charges. Contract terms for AMAs originated through the 
Direct to Consumer Channel can vary depending on packages selected, with the current standard offering being a three year contract. 
When a customer initiates and completes the sales process to obtain alarm monitoring services, including signing an AMA, we pre-configure the alarm monitoring system based on the customer's specifications, then package and ship the equipment directly to the customer. The customer has the option to self-install the equipment or have a professional installation. The customer activates the monitoring service with our central station over the phone. With the development of our Field Sales teams, launched in several geographical areas in 2020, customers can have personalized in-home appointments to walk through all available options for security, home automation and life safety services, with professional installation occurring at the appointment or shortly thereafter.
Negotiated Bulk Account Acquisitions

In addition to the development of our primary channels, we periodically acquire alarm monitoring accounts from other alarm companies in bulk on a negotiated basis. Our management has extensive experience in identifying potential opportunities, negotiating account acquisitions and performing thorough due diligence, which helps facilitate execution of new acquisitions in a timely manner. The Company completed three separate large bulk acquisitions in 2020, two of which were completed using a unique earnout structure model which improves creation cost metrics and shares attrition risk with the seller.
Customer Operations
Once a customer has contracted for services, we provide 24-hour monitoring services through our alarm monitoring center as well as billing and 24-hour technical support through our customer care center, located in Farmers Branch, Texas. Our alarm monitoring center has received the Monitoring Association's prestigious Five Diamond certification. Five Diamond certification is achieved by having all alarm monitoring operators complete special industry training and pass an exam.
We have a back-up facility in Dallas, Texas that is capable of supporting monitoring and certain customer service operations in the event of a disruption at our primary alarm monitoring and customer care center. In addition, due to the impacts of COVID-19, we also have enacted measures to enable our call center operators to operate from home
Our telephone systems utilize high-capacity, high-quality, digital circuits backed up by conventional telephone lines. When an alarm signal is received at the monitoring facility, it is routed to an operator. At the same time, information concerning the subscriber whose alarm has been activated and the nature and location of the alarm signal is delivered to the operator's computer terminal. The operator is then responsible for following standard procedures to contact the subscriber or take other appropriate action, including, if the situation requires, contacting local emergency service providers. We never dispatch our own personnel to the subscriber's premises in response to an alarm event. If a subscriber lives in an area where the emergency service provider will not respond without verification of an actual emergency, we will contract with an independent third party responder if available in that area.
Interactive and advance security features, home automation and life safety services are contracted with and provided by various third party technology companies to the subscriber.
We seek to increase subscriber satisfaction and retention by carefully managing customer and technical service. The customer care center handles all general inquiries from all subscribers, including those related to subscriber information changes, basic alarm troubleshooting, alarm verification, technical service requests and requests to enhance existing services. We have a proprietary centralized information system that enables us to satisfy a substantial amount of subscriber technical inquiries over the telephone, without dispatching a service technician. If the customer requires field service, we rely on our nationwide network of independent service dealers and over 130 employee field service technicians to provide such service. We closely monitor service dealer performance with customer satisfaction forms, follow-up quality assurance calls and other performance metrics. In 2020, we dispatched approximately 200 independent service dealers around the country to handle our field service.
Customers
We believe that our subscriber acquisition process, which includes both clearly defined customer account standards and a comprehensive due diligence process focusing on both the authorized dealer and representative programs and the AMAs to be acquired, contributes significantly to the high quality of our subscriber base. For each of the last five calendar years, the average credit score associated with AMAs that were acquired was 710 or higher on the FICO scale.
Substantially all of our subscribers are residential homeowners or small business commercial accounts, and the remainder are large commercial accounts that were acquired in the Select Security Transaction. In the residential sector, we focus our efforts on obtaining customers that are residential homeowners, rather than renters, which we believe can reduce attrition, because homeowners relocate less frequently than renters.
Intellectual Property

Pursuant to the terms of the Brink's License Agreement, Monitronics has exclusive use of the Brinks and Brinks Home Security trademarks related to the residential smart home and home security categories in the U.S. and Canada. The Brink's License Agreement provides for an initial term of seven years and, subject to certain conditions, allows for subsequent renewal periods whereby Monitronics can extend the agreement beyond 20 years. We also own certain proprietary software applications that are used to provide services to our dealers and subscribers, including various trademarks and patents. Other than as mentioned above, we do not hold any patents or other intellectual property rights on our proprietary software applications.
Strategy
Our strategy is centered around the tagline of "creating profitable accounts, at scale and holding for life." We believe that by ensuring that all initiatives drive toward this mantra, we will maximize return on invested capital. We aim to achieve best in class customer engagement by delivering premium and innovative smart home security solutions. The go to market strategy is grounded on attracting a loyal persona that has high ability and willingness to pay, demands expert support and ideally prefers professional installation along with lifetime excellence in support and timely service. For detailed discussion of specific strategic initiatives, see "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."
For a description of the risks associated with the Company's strategies, and with the Company's business in general, see "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS."
Seasonality
Our business experiences a certain level of seasonality. Because more household moves take place during the second and third calendar quarters of each year, our disconnect rate and new customer additions may be higher in those quarters than in the first and fourth calendar quarters. In addition, we may see increased servicing costs related to higher alarm signals and customer service requests as a result of customer power outages and other issues due to weather-related incidents.
Industry; Competition

The security alarm industry is highly competitive and has become more complex with consumer demand for smart home integration. Our competitors include other major security alarm companies with nationwide coverage, numerous smaller providers with regional or local coverage and certain large multi-service organizations that operate in multiple industries, including the technology, telecommunications and cable businesses. Our significant competitors for obtaining subscriber AMAs include:
•ADT, Inc. ("ADT"); 
•Vivint Smart Home, Inc.; 
•Comcast Corporation;
•SimpliSafe, Inc.; and
•Ring LLC.
Competition in the security alarm industry is based primarily on reputation for quality of service, market visibility, services offered, brand recognition, price and the ability to identify and obtain customer accounts. Competition for customers has also increased in recent years with the emergence of DIY home security providers and other technology companies expanding into the security alarm industry. We believe we compete effectively with our competitors due to our reputation for reliable monitoring, customer and technical services, the quality of our services and our relatively lower cost structure. We believe the dynamics of the security alarm industry favor larger alarm monitoring companies, such as Brinks Home Security, with a nationwide focus that have greater resources and benefit from economies of scale in technology, advertising and other expenditures.
Some of these security alarm companies have also adopted, in whole or in part, a dealer program similar to ours. In these instances, we must also compete with these programs in recruiting dealers. We believe we compete effectively with other dealer 
programs due to the quality of our dealer support services and our competitive acquisition terms. Our significant competitors for recruiting dealers include:
•ADT;
•Guardian Protection Services, Inc.; and
•Vector Security, Inc.
Regulatory Matters

Our operations are subject to a variety of laws, regulations and licensing requirements of federal, state and local authorities including federal and state customer protection laws. In certain jurisdictions, we are required to obtain licenses or permits to comply with standards governing employee selection and training and to meet certain standards in the conduct of our business. The security industry is also subject to requirements imposed by various insurance, approval, listing and standards organizations. Depending upon the type of subscriber served, the type of security service provided and the requirements of the applicable local governmental jurisdiction, adherence to the requirements and standards of such organizations is mandatory in some instances and voluntary in others.
Although local governments routinely respond to panic and smoke/fire alarms, there are an increasing number of local governmental authorities that have adopted or are considering various measures aimed at reducing the number of false burglar alarms. Such measures include:
•subjecting alarm monitoring companies to fines or penalties for false alarms;
•imposing fines on alarm subscribers for false alarms;
•imposing limitations on the number of times the police will respond to false alarms at a particular location;
•requiring additional verification of intrusion alarms by calling two different phone numbers prior to dispatch ("Enhanced Call Verification"); and
•requiring visual verification of an actual emergency at the premises before the police will respond to an alarm signal.
Enhanced Call Verification has been implemented as standard policy by us.
Security alarm systems monitored by us utilize telephone lines, internet connections, cellular networks and radio frequencies to transmit alarm signals. The cost of telephone lines and the type of equipment that may be used in telephone line transmissions, are currently regulated by both federal and state governments. The operation and utilization of cellular and radio frequencies are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission and state public utility commissions.
For additional information on the regulatory framework in which we operate, please see "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS — Factors Relating to Regulatory Matters."
