ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
 At our core, we are a global services company. With over 90% market share in the historically highly attractive outsourced maritime health and wellness market, we are the market leader at more than 10x the size of our closest maritime competitor. Over the last 50 years, we have built our leading market position on our depth of staff expertise; broad and innovative service and product offerings; expansive global recruitment, training and logistics platform; and decades-long relationships with cruise line and destination resort partners. Throughout our history, our mission has been simple: helping guests look and feel their best during and after their stay. We serve a critical role for our cruise line and destination resort partners, operating a complex and increasingly important aspect of their overall guest experience. Decades of investment and know-how have allowed us to construct an unmatched global infrastructure to manage the complexity of our operations. We have consistently expanded our onboard offerings with innovative, leading-edge service and product introductions, and developed a powerful back-end recruiting, training and logistics platform to manage our operational complexity, maintain our industry-leading quality standards and maximize revenue per center. The combination of our renowned recruiting and training platform, deep labor pool, global logistics and supply chain infrastructure and proven revenue management capabilities represents a significant competitive advantage that we believe is not economically feasible to replicate. These competitive advantages have served our business well during these extremely challenging times for our industry.
Impact of Coronavirus (COVID-19)
 On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak (“COVID-19”) a “Public Health Emergency of International Concern,” and on March 10, 2020, declared COVID-19 a pandemic. The regional and global outbreak of COVID-19 has negatively impacted our operations. Quarantines, labor shortages and other disruptions, including the cancellation of cruise itineraries and the closure of resort properties, have adversely impacted our revenues, the ability to provide services, our operating results, and our financial condition and liquidity, and may continue to have further or additional adverse impacts in the future. In addition, COVID-19 has resulted in a widespread health crisis that has materially adversely affected the economies and financial markets of many countries, causing an economic downturn that has materially adversely impacted and is expected to continue to materially adversely impact for the foreseeable future the demand for our services and products. As such, the full impact on our operations and our results of operations and financial condition, including our liquidity, is difficult to assess at this point in time. As of the date of this report, the extent to which COVID-19 will impact us will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, the actions taken by governmental authorities to contain COVID-19 or to mitigate its impact, and actions taken by our cruise line and destination resort partners, among others.
 
In September 2020, we began the resumption of limited spa operations with one of our cruise line partners. Likewise, during the second quarter of 2020, we began the resumption of spa operations in a limited number of destination resorts as part of our phased-in return to service. As of December 31, 2020, 45 destination resort spas were operating, some with capacity restrictions. Starting in the first quarter of 2020, and continuing through the fourth quarter of 2020 and currently, COVID-19-related shutdowns have had a significant negative impact on our operations. We believe the ongoing effects of COVID-19 on our operations will continue to have a significant negative impact on our financial performance and liquidity and such negative impact may continue well beyond the containment of the pandemic. Due to the unknown duration and extent of the impact of the pandemic, which will depend on a number of factors, including the duration and scope of the pandemic, travel restrictions and advisories, the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and their effectiveness, the potential continued unavailability of ports and/or destinations of our cruise partners and a general impact on consumer sentiment, the full effect on our financial performance cannot be quantified at this time.
 
The Company has also undertaken steps to mitigate the adverse impact of the pandemic, which have included, without limitation, the following:
 
 
• | commencing in March 2020, closed all spas on ships where voyages have been cancelled (as of December 31, 2020, we were operating one spa onboard one vessel);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | closed all destination resort spas as of March 26, 2020 (as of December 31, 2020, 45 destination resort spas had reopened and were operating, some with capacity restrictions);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | repatriated 3,220 of our staff due to COVID-related sailing suspensions, constituting all our cruise ship personnel, eliminating all ongoing expenses related to these employees during 2020, and re-embarked 18 cruise ship personnel to operate our spas on three vessels that sailed at any time during the fourth quarter of 2020 (only one of which was sailing as of December 31, 2020);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | furloughed 96% and subsequently terminated the employment of 66% of U.S. and Caribbean-based destination resort spa personnel and 38% of corporate personnel and implemented salary reductions for all corporate personnel; as of December 31, 2020, 386 U.S. and Caribbean-based destination resort spa personnel had returned to work and 72 salary reductions remained in place for corporate personnel;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | eliminated all non-essential operating and capital expenditures;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | withdrew our dividend program until further notice and
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | payment of the dividend declared on February 26, 2020, in the amount of $2.4 million, until approved by the Board of Directors;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | completed the private placement (the “2020 Private Placement”) of $75 million in common equity and warrants to Steiner Leisure and its affiliates, other investors, Company management and members of the Board of Directors;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | borrowed $7 million, net, on our revolving credit facility, leaving $13 million available and undrawn at December 31, 2020; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | entered into an agreement that permits the Company to sell, from time to time, common shares up to an aggregate offering price of $50.0 million (the “ATM Program”), resulting in $11.1 million net proceeds to the Company.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Business
 The majority of our revenue and profits are earned through long-term revenue sharing agreements with cruise line partners that economically align both parties and contribute to our attractive asset-light financial profile. These agreements average approximately five years in length and provide us with the exclusive right to offer health, fitness, beauty and wellness services and the ability to sell complementary products onboard the ships we serve. Under these long-term agreements, cruise line partners retain a specified percentage of revenues from all our sales onboard. This inherent alignment encourages collaboration in all aspects of our operations, including facility design, product innovation, pre- and post-cruise sales opportunities, capacity utilization initiatives and other data-driven strategies to drive increased guest traffic and revenue growth. Most of our cruise line agreements encompass 100% of a partner cruise line’s existing fleet and all new ships introduced by the cruise line during the term of the agreement. As opposed to fixed-rent landlords, cruise lines and destination resorts serve as our aligned economic partners.
 We are recognized by our cruise line and destination resort partners and our guests for our comprehensive suite of services and products. We curate and deliver a broad range of offerings centered on providing specific health, fitness, beauty, and wellness solutions to meet our guests’ lifestyle routines or objectives. These services include: (i) traditional body, salon, and skin care services and products; (ii) self-service fitness facilities, specialized fitness classes and personal fitness training; (iii) innovative pain management, detoxifying programs and comprehensive body composition analyses; (iv) weight management programs and products; and (v) advanced medi-spa services, among others. We also offer our guests access to leading beauty and wellness brands including ELEMIS ®, Kérastase ® and Dysport ®, with many brands offered exclusively by us in the cruise market. On average, during normal operating conditions, guests spend $230 per visit and our solution sales approach drives substantial retail sales, with approximately 25% of our revenues derived from the sale of retail products.
 Our state-of-the-art health, fitness, beauty and wellness centers are designed and branded for each cruise line and destination resort to optimize the guest experience, align with our partners’ overall hospitality atmosphere and maximize productivity. Centers can employ up to 105 highly trained professionals and range in size from 200 to over 30,000 square feet, depending on the cruise line or destination resort partner’s needs.
 Our cruise line relationships average over 20 years and encompass substantially all of the major global cruise lines, including Carnival Cruise Line, Royal Caribbean Cruises, Princess Cruises, Norwegian Cruise Lines, Celebrity Cruises, Costa Cruises and Holland America, among many others. These partnerships extend across contemporary, premium, luxury and budget cruise lines that operate ships regionally and globally. We maintain what we believe to be an exceptional contract renewal rate with our cruise line partners, having renewed approximately 94% of our contracts based on ship count over the last 15 years, including 100% of our contracts with ships larger than 3,500 berths. We have not only maintained relationships with existing cruise line partners, but also have a history of winning contracts and gaining market share. In 2019, we signed an agreement with Celebrity Cruises to become the exclusive operator of health and wellness centers on Celebrity’s entire fleet, increasing the Celebrity vessels by nine, extended our current agreement with Norwegian Cruise Lines through 2024, and signed an agreement with the new lifestyle brand Virgin Voyages as the exclusive operator of the spa and wellness offerings onboard Virgin vessels. On land, we have longstanding relationships with the world’s leading destination hotel and resort operators, including Marriott, Hilton, ClubMed, Caesars Entertainment, Lotte, Loews and Four Seasons, among others.

Our Operations and Performance
 We are a Bahamian international business company that earns a substantial portion of our revenue in low- or no-tax jurisdictions, benefitting from a comparatively low effective cash tax rate. Additionally, we have minimal capital expenditures, as our cruise line and destination resort partners typically fund the build-out, maintenance, and refurbishment of our health and wellness centers. The combination of our attractive tax rate and asset-light operating model leads to a financial profile that delivers comparatively high Unlevered After-Tax Free Cash Flow. In fiscal 2018 and 2019, prior to the cessation of operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we had converted approximately 90% of our Adjusted EBITDA to Unlevered After-Tax Free Cash Flow.
 We have historically driven strong financial performance and believe our leading market position in a growing industry, differentiated business model and entrenched cruise line and destination resort partner relationships position our business for future growth. Due to the impact of COVID-19 on our operations in 2020, current year data is not meaningful. However, for the year ended December 31, 2019, we achieved revenues of $562.2 million, Adjusted EBITDA of $59.0 million, Net Loss of $37.0 million and Unlevered After-Tax Free Cash Flow of $55.4 million. 
 Attractive Market Opportunity
 
Despite the adverse conditions impacting global operations and economies resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak, we continue to operate at the intersection of the historically attractive health and wellness and travel leisure industries. We believe we are well-positioned to grow as the cruise industry recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Historical Cruise Industry Growth
 
Prior to COVID-19, the cruise industry had been among the fastest-growing segments in the travel leisure industry, including through the recessions of 2001 and 2008-2010. We estimate, based on annual statistics published by Cruise Lines International Association (“CLIA”), that global passenger counts had grown every year until 2020 from approximately 6.3 million passengers in 1995 to an all-time high of approximately 30.0 million passengers in 2019, representing a compound annual growth rate of 6.7%. This passenger growth had been driven by consistent, significant investments in new cruise ship capacity, strong loyalty among experienced cruisers and the large and growing appeal of cruising to all demographics, including millennials. 
Historically Large and Growing Health and Wellness Industry
 
Our health and wellness centers cater to guests seeking a continuation of their health, fitness, beauty and wellness activities while traveling and those who want to trial services while away from home. As consumers increasingly incorporate health and wellness activities into their daily lives, they are placing a higher priority on health and wellness services while traveling and vacationing. The Global Wellness Institute (“GWI”) estimates in its most recently issued global wellness economy report that wellness-related tourism grew at twice the rate of general tourism from 2015 to 2017.
Our Evolution
 
Our history dates back to the early 1960’s, when we opened the world’s first salons at sea onboard transatlantic cruise ships, including the Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth II. Over more than 50 years, we have continuously defined and redefined the onboard health, fitness, beauty and wellness category by consistently expanding our onboard offerings with innovative and leading-edge service and product introductions, while developing the powerful back-end recruiting, training and logistics platforms to manage and optimize the complexity of our operations and maintain our industry-leading quality standards. We have successfully evolved the onboard health, fitness, beauty and wellness category from what was once a consumer-centric amenity for passengers to a key onboard revenue driver for our cruise line partners.
 In 2015, a consortium led by L Catterton acquired Steiner Leisure, the holding company of OneSpaWorld at that time (the “2015 Transaction”). Since then, OneSpaWorld has strengthened its already proven platform by leveraging L Catterton’s expertise in consumer services, consumer products, multi-unit retail operations and customer acquisition, among other expertise. OneSpaWorld has enhanced collaboration with its cruise line and destination resort partners to reinforce its market leading position and introduced innovative revenue initiatives to accelerate its revenue growth. Key recent initiatives include:

• | enhancing and expanding collaboration with cruise line and destination resort partners;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | creating pre-marketing, pre-booking and pre-payment platforms with optimal positioning on cruise line websites;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | employing data-driven, dynamic pricing of services to optimize facility utilization and revenue generation;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | incorporating advanced direct marketing programs, including personalized communications and value promotions, to drive consumer demand;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | shifting revenue mix towards higher value-add services through new service introductions and higher-ticket products, coupled with enhanced consultative sales training techniques;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expanding medi-spa services to the majority of ships within our fleet;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | collaborating with global brands to leverage our powerful retail channel and captive audience of over 20 million consumers with above average household income;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | increasing frequency of budgeting and KPI reviews with cruise line and destination resort partners;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | improving staff productivity through enhanced incentive and retention measures; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | leveraging the strength of our global marketing, recruiting, training, logistics and facility design platforms across our cruise line and destination resort partnerships.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 On March 19, 2019 (the “Business Combination Date”), OneSpaWorld consummated a business combination pursuant to a Business Combination Agreement, dated as of November 1, 2018 (as amended on January 7, 2019, by Amendment No. 1 to the Business Combination Agreement), by and among Steiner Leisure Limited (“Steiner Leisure,” “Steiner,” or “Parent”), Steiner U.S. Holdings, Inc., Nemo (UK) Holdco, Ltd., Steiner UK Limited, Steiner Management Services, LLC, Haymaker Acquisition Corp. (“Haymaker”), OneSpaWorld, Dory US Merger Sub, LLC, Dory Acquisition Sub, Limited, Dory Intermediate LLC, and Dory Acquisition Sub, Inc. (the “Business Combination”), in which Haymaker acquired from Steiner the combined operating business known as OSW Predecessor (“OSW”). Prior to the consummation of the Business Combination, OneSpaWorld was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Steiner Leisure. On the Business Combination Date, OneSpaWorld became the ultimate parent company of the Haymaker and OSW combined company. 
 Prior to the cessation of our cruise line and destination resort operations due to COVID-19, our comprehensive suite of premium health, fitness, beauty and wellness services and products reached more consumers than ever before, with 175 centers onboard cruise ships addressing a captive audience of over 20 million passengers annually, and 68 destination resort centers serving global travelers at premier destination resorts around the world.
 Our Strengths
 
As noted above, we cannot yet fully predict the impacts of COVID-19 on the travel leisure industry or on our business. Despite this uncertainty, we believe that our competitive strengths historically have positioned us, and will continue to position us, as a leader in the hospitality-based health and wellness industry and the category dominant leader in the cruise industry.
 
Global Leader in the Hospitality-Based Health and Wellness Industry
 
As the pre-eminent global operator of health and wellness centers onboard cruise ships and a leading operator of health and wellness centers at destination resorts worldwide, we are at the center of the intersection between the health and wellness and travel leisure industries. In 2018, the Global Wellness Institute reported that global wellness tourism was a $639 billion industry. We command over 90% market share in the highly attractive outsourced maritime health and wellness market and we are more than 10x the size of our closest competitor. Through our market share, we have had access to a captive audience of over 20 million passengers. Cruise ship guests are an attractive demographic, with average annual household incomes of over $100,000. As a result of our scale, our captive consumer audience, and consumers’ increasing desire for more health, fitness, beauty and wellness services and products, we are well-positioned in the global health and wellness industry and have a large and highly attractive addressable consumer market at sea and on land.

Differentiated Business Model That Would Be Difficult and Uneconomic to Replicate
 
For more than 50 years, our business model has been built through investment in global infrastructure and training, decades-long relationships with our cruise line and destination resort partners and our reputation for offering our guests a best-in-class health, fitness, beauty and wellness experience. Our 
robust infrastructure and processes required to operate and maximize revenue across our network of global health and wellness centers separates us from our peers. In 2019, we embarked on over 8,600 voyages that welcomed over 22 million passengers at more than 178 ports of embarkation. Our business model is centered on providing our cruise line and destination resort partners with the following solutions:

• | Global Recruiting, Training and Logistics —Prior to the near cessation of our operations due to COVID-19, we recruited, trained and managed over 3,000 health, fitness, beauty and wellness professionals annually around the world, representing 88 nationalities and 24 spoken languages. With seven global training facilities, we serve each cruise line’s needs for specific onboard staff with complex language, cultural and service modality requirements and are the only company with the infrastructure to commission highly trained staff at over 1,200 ports of call worldwide.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Supply Chain and Logistics —We manage the complex delivery of all products and supplies to our health and wellness centers onboard vessels operating itineraries around the world, leveraging proprietary data to accurately forecast and stock each health and wellness center. Products and supplies can only be loaded at designated ports around the world during a limited window of time while the ship is in port, in many cases overnight, adding to the complexity of the process.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Yield and Revenue Management —We have developed proprietary technology, processes and staff training tools to consistently measure, analyze and maximize onboard and destination resort revenue and profitability.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Exclusive Relationships with Global Brands —Due to our scale, superior operations, industry longevity and attractive captive consumer audience, prior to the near cessation of our operations due to COVID-19, we had over 1,100 product SKUs sourced from over 90 vendors offered through the OneSpaWorld platform at sea, including ELEMIS, Kérastase, Thermage ®, GoodFeet ® Arch Supports and GO SMILE ® Teeth Whitening.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Facility Design and Branding Expertise —We design our state-of-the-art health and wellness centers specifically for each cruise line vessel and destination resort, creating bespoke branding, guest experience, guest services offerings, complementary retail products assortment, and competitive differentiation for each of our cruise line and destination resort partners to optimize guest experiences and maximize productivity and financial performance.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The above capabilities have contributed to building a differentiated and defensible strategy around our leading market position in a historically growing and attractive industry.
 Unmatched Breadth of Service and Product Offering
 
We offer our guests a comprehensive suite of health, fitness, beauty and wellness services and products to meet any and all of their needs. We are continuously innovating and evolving our offerings based on the latest trends and tailor our service and product offerings to regional preferences. In addition to conventional services, we offer the latest in fitness, a full range of massage treatments, nutrition/weight management consultations, teeth whitening, and acupuncture, among a broad spectrum of personal care services. OneSpaWorld has also introduced innovative, higher-ticket medi-spa services at sea, including BOTOX ® Cosmetic, Dysport, Restylane ®, CoolSculpting ®, Thermage and dermal fillers, among others. With our captive audience of over 20 million cruise guests annually, OneSpaWorld is a compelling distribution channel for leading health, fitness, beauty and wellness brands. Renowned brands, including ELEMIS and Kérastase, have partnered with us for exclusive distribution at sea. Cruise line and destination resort partners depend on us to provide their guests with the best and broadest assortment of services and products to enhance their vacation experience and the competitive positioning and consumer value of their brands.

Entrenched Partnerships with Economic Alignment
 
We have cultivated partnerships with most of the largest and most reputable cruise lines and premier resorts in the world. Our cruise line relationships average over 20 years and encompass substantially all of the major global cruise lines, including Carnival Cruise Line, Royal Caribbean Cruises, Princess Cruises, Norwegian Cruise Lines, Celebrity Cruises, Crystal Cruises, Costa Cruises, Seabourn Cruise Line, Virgin Voyages, and Holland America, among many others. The majority of our revenues and profits are earned through our long-term revenue sharing agreements with our cruise line partners that economically align both parties and create a collaborative relationship. On land, we partner with market leaders at highly attractive destinations, including Atlantis Paradise Island Bahamas, The Ocean Club, a Four Seasons Resort, Hilton Hawaiian Village Beach Resort and Spa, and the Mohegan Sun Resort, among others. Our long-standing relationships, with economic alignment at the core, strengthen our competitive advantage.
Highly Visible and Predictable Revenue Streams
 
Historically, we have had access to over 20 million passengers annually, with potential long-term passenger growth expected in the future, post the COVID-19 pandemic, as new ships are commissioned in the industry. This new ship growth is highly visible as demonstrated in a publicly available global order book outlining over five years of new ship orders. Across our contracts, OneSpaWorld typically operates on all ships in a fleet and on new ships added during the contract term, securing both existing and new ship revenue. A new ship requires approximately two to four years to be built and is rarely delayed, as cruise lines typically sell out the vessel’s maiden voyage over a year in advance. New ships do not have a revenue ramp-up period given these advanced marketing efforts. Our cruise line partners are experts at dependably filling their ships with passengers, as demonstrated by the industry’s historical average occupancy rate of above 100%, even through recessionary periods. Due to historically consistent industry practices and decades of proprietary operating history data, OneSpaWorld has had strong visibility into our future revenue realization for the next three to five years. Despite current market conditions related to COVID-19, we expect these revenue streams to rebound in the future to historical levels.
Asset-Light Model with After-Tax Free Cash Flow Generation
 
Third parties typically fund the build-out, maintenance, and refurbishment of our onboard health and wellness centers, resulting in an asset-light profile with minimal capex required. Our capital expenditures averaged 1% of revenues over the three years preceding the near cessation of our operations due to COVID-19. Being a Bahamian international business company and earning a significant portion of our revenue in low-tax or no-tax jurisdictions, including international waters, our effective cash tax rate had been approximately 1% over the three years preceding the near cessation of our operations due to COVID-19.
 This combination translates to exceptional after-tax free cash flow. Annually, from 2017 through 2019, we converted approximately 90% of our Adjusted EBITDA to Unlevered After-Tax Free Cash Flow. 
 
Seasoned and Proven Leadership Team
 
OneSpaWorld is led by a management team that has operated the Company for nearly 20 years. Our Executive Chairman, Leonard Fluxman, and our CFO and COO, Stephen Lazarus, together led Steiner 
Leisure as a public company for more than a decade. Mr. Fluxman, Mr. Lazarus and our President and Chief Executive Officer, Glenn Fusfield, now lead an internally developed senior management team with over 150 years of combined industry experience. As previously announced, Mr. Fusfield will be retiring from his position as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company effective March 31, 2021 and will continue to serve as a non-employee director of the Company until the 2022 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. 
 On October 13, 2020, Susan Bonner joined the Company as Chief Commercial Officer. Ms. Bonner has over 20 years of experience in the cruise line sector and is a seasoned executive with a proven track record and significant background in strategy, revenue management, operations management, sales, and marketing. We also benefit from Haymaker’s investing and operational experience at Fortune 500 companies, particularly in the consumer and hospitality sectors. The OneSpaWorld management team’s deep experience and proven track record in managing the business in both public and private markets positions OneSpaWorld as an attractive vehicle for future long-term growth within the global hospitality-based health and wellness industry.
 Growth Strategies
 Our management plans to continue growing the business through the following strategies:
 
Capture Highly Visible New Ship Growth with Current Cruise Line Partners
 
We expect to continue to benefit long-term from a return to the cruise industry’s capacity for growth, with a consistent and visible pipeline of new ships commissioned annually by our cruise line partners. By the end of 2022, our existing cruise line partners are expected to introduce 24 new ships, representing a 15% increase in our ship count from 2020. Through established cruise line 
 7


partner relationships, current contracts, and an approximately 94% contract renewal rate over the last 15 years, we are well-positioned to capture new ship growth over the long term.
 Expand Market Share by Adding New Potential Cruise Line Partners
 
Although we have over 90% market share in the outsourced maritime health and wellness market, there is an opportunity to continue to grow our market share by winning new contracts. In 2019, prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, we signed an agreement with Celebrity Cruises as the exclusive operator of health and wellness centers on Celebrity’s entire fleet, increasing the Celebrity vessels on which we operate by nine, extended our current agreement with Norwegian Cruise Lines through 2024, and won a contract with the new lifestyle brand Virgin Voyages to operate the spa and wellness offerings onboard three Virgin vessels, planned to launch in 2021 and 2022. We also routinely meet with cruise lines that do not currently outsource their health and wellness centers or utilize our smaller competitors, but that may have an interest in contracting with us in the future due to our strong reputation and historical results. As evidenced by our successful history of winning new contracts, we remain focused on continuing to protect and grow our dominant market share at sea.
Continue Launching More Value-Added Services and Products
 
We have successfully innovated services and products to meet guests’ ever-changing needs, attract more guests and generate more revenue per guest. Medi-spa has been a highly successful innovation for OneSpaWorld at sea and is now a critical component of our offerings. Performed by licensed physicians, the medi-spa offerings provide the latest cosmetic medical services to guests, such as non-surgical cosmetic procedures, including BOTOX Cosmetic, Dysport, Restylane, CoolSculpting, Thermage, and dermal fillers. Guests purchasing medi-spa services spend on average up to 10x more than on traditional health, beauty and wellness 
services. We continue to roll out Kérastase, a leading global professional hair care brand. In 2019, we experienced year-over-year growth of 24% and a 41% increase in Kérastase retail attachment. We will continue to focus on launching higher value-add services and products that meet guest demands, align with and enhance our cruise line and destination resort partner brands, optimize health and wellness center utilization, and maximize center-level profitability.
Focus on Enhancing Health and Wellness Center Productivity
 
Cruise lines have become increasingly focused on growing onboard revenue as a way to enhance revenue beyond traditional cabin ticket sales. Between 2013 and 2019, onboard spend on the three largest cruise operators we serve increased by $2.6 billion, from $6.5 billion to $9.1 billion. According to an independent global consulting study, 45% of passengers say they are interested in using our health and wellness centers onboard. We are focused on collaborating with cruise line partners to increase passenger penetration and maximize revenue yield through the following initiatives:

• | Increase Pre-Booking and Pre-Payment Capture Rate —We are working with our cruise line partners to expand our marketing efforts to engage guests upon booking their vacation experience, well before boarding a ship, through pre-booking. Pre-booked appointments can yield approximately 30% more revenue than services booked onboard the ship. Due to our success across select cruise lines that have implemented pre-booking capabilities, we are in the process of implementing pre-booking across additional partner cruise lines.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand Targeted Marketing and Promotion Initiatives —We are now directly marketing and distributing promotions to onboard passengers as a result of enhanced collaboration with select cruise line partners. These promotions are personalized and individually tailored to guests’ profiles and have successfully driven traffic and revenue at our health and wellness centers. Examples include “happy anniversary” messages to couples, “happy birthday” notes to individual guests, and promotional retail credits offered to guests who visit our centers before the end of their cruise. Guests that received these customized promotions were responsible for approximately 8% of revenues generated during the year ended December 31, 2019.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Utilize Technology to Increase Utilization and Enhance Service Mix —We have recently begun to successfully introduce and expand technology-enabled dynamic pricing initiatives with selected cruise line partners. While dynamic pricing strategies have historically been applied manually by onboard staff, we are currently rolling out online and pre-cruise access to drive off-peak utilization rates and fill higher-demand time slots with higher-value bookings. This enhanced dynamic pricing capability is currently available with only a few cruise line partners, representing a significant opportunity for revenue growth as it is rolled out and optimized fleet-wide.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Extend Retail Beyond the Ship —Our Shop & Ship program provides guests the ability to buy retail products onboard and have products shipped directly to their home to avoid the hassle of packing products in their luggage. On average, a Shop & Ship customer spends more than 3.5x the amount of a non-Shop & Ship customer on retail products. The Shop &
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ship program, combined with our e-commerce platform timetospa.com, gives us the ability to maintain a connection with each guest beyond the cruise voyage.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Health and Wellness Services
 
We curate and deliver an ever-innovating broad range of offerings for our cruise line and destination resort partners, centered around a holistic wellness approach, which includes:

• | Spa and Beauty. We offer massages and a broad variety of other body and beauty treatments including facials, hair cutting and styling, manicures and pedicures, and tanning. Additionally, we offer teeth whitening services in the majority of our onboard health and wellness centers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Medi-spa. We offer medi-spa services on the majority of our ships. Our service menu consists of the leading medi-spa brands, including BOTOX Cosmetic, Dysport, Restylane, CoolSculpting, Thermage, and dermal fillers, among others. Prior to the cessation of our operations due to COVID-19, medi-spa services were available on 99 ships and administered by certified medical physicians.

• | Fitness. We offer guests use of fitness centers as well as paid services by a fitness professional to our cruise and destination resort guests. The fitness centers are typically free and offer guests use of strength equipment, cardiovascular equipment such as treadmills, elliptical machines, exercise bicycles and rowing and stair machines. Boutique fitness classes, including yoga, Pilates, cycling, and aerobics, are also available to guests for a fee or at no charge, depending on the class. Our fitness instructors are available to provide paid services, such as body composition analysis and personal training.

• | Nutrition. In addition to fitness services, we offer guests paid services including personal nutritional and dietary advice, weight management, nutrition coaching and detoxification. Guests can begin a program on the cruise and remain connected to our professional coach after the cruise to ensure successful completion of the program, such as a nutrition or detoxification plan.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Health. We first introduced acupuncture in 2005 and have since rapidly expanded our health and pain management, offerings to be one of our largest categories. Today, we offer acupuncture, electro acupuncture, cupping, posture and gait analysis, GoodFeet Arch Supports, physical therapy, and NormaTec ® recovery. Our services are enhanced by our retail channel; GoodFeet, a premium arch support insert, is now a leading retail product for us.

Products
 
We sell over 1,100 branded product SKUs sourced from over 90 vendors due to our scale, superior operations, industry longevity and attractive captive audience at sea and on land. We sell products from leading brands, including ELEMIS, Thermage, Dysport, GoodFeet Arch Supports and GO SMILE Teeth Whitening. We have an exclusive 10-year supply agreement with ELEMIS. We believe we have a leading retail attachment rate based on the number of products purchased in conjunction with a service compared to the broader retail industry. Approximately 25% of our revenues come from product sales, enabling incremental revenue even at full treatment room utilization.
 
We utilize three warehouses, one 35,000 square foot bonded warehouse in Miami, FL, one 10,000 square foot warehouse in Miami, FL, and one 4,000 square foot warehouse in New Jersey. The Miami warehouses provide fulfillment services for cruise inventory, and the New Jersey warehouse provides fulfillment for e-commerce and the Shop & Ship program.
 
Health and Wellness Centers
 As of December 31, 2020, we operated state-of-the-art health and wellness centers on 163 ships, including virtually all of the major cruise lines globally, and 54 land-based destination resorts, principally in the United States, the Caribbean and Asia. Centers are designed and branded for each cruise and destination resort partner to optimize the guest experience, maximize revenues and align with our partners’ brand and hospitality environment. Centers can range in size from approximately 200 square feet to over 30,000 square feet and generally provide fitness areas, treatment rooms and salons, as well as elaborate thermal suites and/or saunas. Cruise centers are generally located on higher ship decks, which encourages increased passenger interest and guest traffic.

Facility Design
 
Our cruise line and destination resort partners each seek differentiated health and wellness experiences for their guests. As such, we provide design capabilities for our cruise line and destination resort partners, creating bespoke branding and design consulting to optimize guest experiences and maximize revenues. We operate health and wellness centers under proprietary brands of Mandara ® and Chavana ®, as well as brands cur
ated specifically for each cruise line, complete with cruise line and/or ship-specific service menus. Prior to the near cessation of our operations due to COVID-19, as of December 31, 2019, we had 39 health and wellness centers under the Mandara brand, 11 centers under the Chavana brand, and one center under our destination resort health and wellness brand, “Glow ®, a Mandara Spa.”
Principal Cruise Line Customers
 A significant portion of our revenue is generated from each of the following cruise lines, which accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively: Carnival (including Carnival, Carnival Australia, Costa, Holland America, P&O, Princess, and Seabourn cruise lines): 43.4%, 46.7%, and 48.5%, Royal Caribbean (including Royal Caribbean, Celebrity Cruises, Pullmantur, Azamara and Silversea cruise lines): 20.9%, 23.1%, and 21.0%, and Norwegian Cruise Line (including Norwegian Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises): 16.3%, 14.7%, and 13.8%. These companies, combined, accounted for 144 of the 163 ships served by OneSpaWorld as of December 31, 2020. Our contracts are signed at the cruise line-level, not with the parent operator, giving OneSpaWorld a diverse customer base despite parent-level consolidation. Our contracts average five years in duration.
 The numbers of ships served as of December 31, 2020 under cruise line agreements with the respective cruise lines, all but one of which are temporarily out of service due to COVID-19, are listed below:

Cruise Line and Destination Resort Agreements
 
Through our cruise line and destination resort agreements, we have the exclusive right to offer health, fitness, beauty and wellness services and the ability to sell complementary products onboard the ships and at the destination resorts we serve. Under the cruise line agreements, guests pay for our services through our cruise line partners, who retain a specified percentage of gross receipts from such sales before remitting the remainder to us. Our revenue share agreements result in a highly variable cost model, where the primary fixed costs are the meals and accommodations for our shipboard employees. Most of our cruise line agreements cover all of the then-operating ships of a cruise line and typically new ships are added to ships in service through an amendment to the agreement. The agreements have specified terms ranging from 2 to 10.7 years, with an average remaining term per ship of approximately 3.3 years as of December 31, 2020. Cruise lines can terminate the agreements with limited or no advance notice under certain circumstances, including, among other things, the withdrawal of a ship from the cruise trade, the sale or lease of a ship, or our failure to achieve specified passenger service standards. However, we have never had a contract terminated prior to our respective expiration date.
 
We operate our destination resort centers pursuant to agreements with the owners of the properties involved. Our destination resort centers generally are required to pay rent based on a percentage of our revenues, with others having fixed rents. Some of our destination resort center agreements also require that we make minimum rental payments irrespective of the amount of our revenues. The terms of the agreements for our destination resort centers generally range from five to 20 years (including the terms of renewals available at our option). In the U.S. and Caribbean, destination resort centers generally have a higher investment cost and lower revenue share with higher staff costs and contracts lasting ten years on average. In Asia, destination resort centers have lower investment cost, higher revenue share, lower staff costs, and contracts averaging five years.
 
Marketing and Promotion
 
We promote our services and products to cruise passengers and destination resort guests through targeted marketing, including pre-and post-cruise emails, website advertising, on-site demonstrations and seminars, video presentations shown on in-cabin/in-room television, ship newsletters, tours of our centers, and dedicated signage around the ship. We also encourage our employees to cross-sell, as they believe that such cross-promotional activities frequently result in our customers purchasing services and/or products in addition to those they initially contemplated buying. For example, we cross-sell our fitness body assessment with detox programs, vitamins, and seaweed wraps. We also maintain a dedicated sales desk to facilitate pre-cruise health and wellness services booking and to disseminate health and wellness information for charters and other groups of cruise passengers.
 
Recent collaborative initiatives with cruise line partners have proven to enhance performance across certain key performance indicators. We have developed a fully integrated pre-booking platform, which allows guests to book health and wellness treatments six to eight weeks prior to the voyage. Pre-booked and pre-paid guests on average spend approximately 30% more than guests who book services once already onboard. We recently introduced targeted marketing, including the ‘positive surprise’ direct marketing 
 11


campaign, where guests receive a targeted gift card to celebrate a birthday, honeymoon, anniversary, or other special occasion. Guests who received the ‘positive surprise’ campaign spent approximately $44.0 million in 2019, or approximately 8% of our revenue. We have begun rolling out our dynamic pricing model to our full cruise fleet, which provides the ability to optimize demand and maximize utilization of our health and wellness centers. We continually monitor the results of our marketing efforts and adjust our strategies in order to use our marketing resources in a cost-effective manner.
 Competition
 
On cruise ships, we compete with passenger activity alternatives for onboard passenger dollars. We also compete with other maritime wellness facility providers, including cruise lines that insource the activity, as well as other outsource providers. Across the destination resorts business, we compete with other outsource providers of health, fitness, beauty and wellness services to hotel and destination resort operators. The destination resorts business is highly fragmented, and there is no one leader within this category.
Seasonality
 
A significant portion of our revenues are generated onboard cruise ships and are subject to specific individual cruise itineraries as to time of year and geographic location, among other factors. As a result, we experience varying degrees of seasonality as the demand for cruises is stronger in the Northern Hemisphere during the summer months and during holidays. Accordingly, the third quarter and holiday periods generally result in the highest revenue yields for us. Further, cruises and destination resorts have been negatively affected by the frequency and intensity of hurricanes, which may be impacted by climate change. The negative impact of hurricanes in the Northern Hemisphere is highest during peak hurricane season from August to October.
Trademarks
 
We hold or control numerous trademarks in the United States and a number of other countries. Our most recognized health and wellness products and services trademarks are for Mandara and Chavana. We believe that the use of our trademarks is important in establishing and maintaining our reputation for providing high quality health and wellness services, as well as cosmetic goods, and we are committed to protecting these trademarks by all appropriate legal means.
 
Registrations for the OneSpaWorld, Mandara and Chavana trademarks, among others, have been obtained in a number of countries throughout the world. We continue to apply for other trademark registrations in various countries.
 While a number of the trademarks we use have been registered in the United States and other countries, the registrations of other trademarks that we use are pending. Recently we have adopted the mark “OneSpaWorld” as the trade name of our maritime health and wellness business to reflect our position as a global provider of shipboard products and services.
 We license “Mandara” for use by luxury destination resorts in certain Asian countries.
 Human Capital
 As a pre-eminent global operator of health and wellness services, our human capital is material to our operations and core to the long-term success of our Company. During the first and second quarters of 2020, in response to the near cessation of our operations due to COVID-19, we took steps to mitigate the adverse impact of the pandemic, including repatriating 3,220 of our cruise ship personnel, furloughing 96% and subsequently terminating the employment of 66% of our U.S. and Caribbean -based destination resort spa personnel and 38% of our corporate personnel, and implementing salary reductions for all our corporate personnel. Due to the impact of COVID-19 on the global cruise industry and our operations in 2020, current year data is not meaningful and not included in this section.

• | Our People. As a Company that provides health and wellness services and products, our employees are the bedrock of the customer experience. As of December 31, 2019, we had a total of 4,298 full-time employees. Of that number, 3,840 worked in health and wellness operations and 426 represented management and sales personnel and support staff, while 32 were involved in recruiting and training. We have one health and wellness center manager in each center and can have up to 105 total staff depending on the size of the center. Our cruise line and destination resort staff are sourced from over 95 countries. Approximately 671 of our employees were located in the United States. Our relationship with our employees is strong.

• | Diversity & Inclusion. Our Company achieves success by serving a diverse customer base, recruiting, training, supporting and resourcing employees from diverse demographic and socioeconomic populations across the globe, and maintaining an unwavering commitment to diversity and inclusion among our staff. OneSpaWorld is an equal opportunity employer and we promote and celebrate diversity in the workplace. We advertise U.S. corporate and destination resort spa positions on a human

resources applicant tracking system, which provides visibility toward all applicants, including diverse candidates. As of December 31, 2019, our employees had the following attributes:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Female | | Male
-------------------+--------+-------+-----
Employees | | 3,479 | | 623
Manager Staff | 290 | | 111 
Executive Officers | 1 | | 3 

 
In order to successfully achieve our goals toward diversity and inclusion, we strive to educate employees, managers, and leadership on these essential topics. Among other things, we provide annual training on the following topics: culture of civility, anti-harassment best practices, cultivating a respectful workplace, anti-harassment crash course: steering clear of sexual harassment, and halting harassment: prevention basics for management. 
  
• | Recruitment. Our continued success is dependent, in part, on our ability to attract qualified employees. Our goal in recruiting and training new employees is to have available a sufficient number of skilled personnel trained in our customer service philosophy. We recruit prospective cruise employees from geographies including the British Isles, Australia, South Africa, the Philippines, Canada, the Caribbean, India, Mauritius and continental Europe, providing an ample pipeline of talent from a wide range of demographics.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Compensation and Benefits. We strive to provide competitive pay and benefits for our employees.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Shipboard spa employees typically are employed under nine month-long agreements with fixed terms, with compensation comprised of commissions received in connection with the provision of services and sales of products in our spas. We make available to all our shipboard employees comprehensive health and dental care, free of charge during the terms of their employment agreements, and provide long-term disability and death compensation, among other benefits. We provide our shipboard employees with transportation to their home countries free of charge following the completion of their employment terms. Our shipboard employees and their family and friends are entitled to discounts on the services and products we offer for sale, as well as personalized fitness and wellness programs. In recent years, we have improved staff retention, resulting in a more experienced staff across our fleet. 
 Employees at our destination resorts generally are employed without contracts, on an at-will basis, although most of our employees in Asia have one- or two-year contracts. Our U.S. corporate and destination resort spa employees are eligible to receive the following company benefits, some which are Company sponsored and some which are voluntary: medical, dental, vision, 401(k) retirement plan, short term disability, long term disability, critical illness, flexible spending account, basic life insurance and basic accidental death and dismemberment, medical indemnity, off the job accident insurance, spouse life insurance and accidental death and dismemberment, child life insurance and accidental death and dismemberment. We provide an employee assistance program free of charge to our employees and members of their household, offering face-to-face mental health counseling sessions with a local provider, legal assistance, financial consultations on topics such as debt counseling and planning for retirement, resources and referrals for childcare providers, before and after school programs, camps, adoption organizations, child development and parental care, resources and referrals for eldercare, including home health agencies, assisted living facilities, social and recreational programs and long-distance caregiving, pet care, including pet setting, obedience training, veterinarians and pet stores, and consultations with fraud resolution specialists intended to prevent identity theft.
  
• | Health and Safety. The health and safety of our employees is the highest priority of the Company. COVID-19 continues to pose a significant risk to our employees. In order to mitigate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, we repatriated all of our cruise ship personnel during 2020. As part of our reopening plan and our response to COVID-19, we took a number of other steps, including implementing a remote work environment for our corporate employees. Following return to work at our corporate office in Coral Gables, employees will be required to complete a training course regarding compliance with COVID-19 protocols and use face coverings and maintain social distancing protocols in accordance with CDC guidelines. Additionally, we created a comprehensive manual entitled “Guidelines for Protection and Sanitization,” or “GPS,” which includes, among others, protocols for sanitization by service, modality and area, behavior, workplace controls, the use of personal protective equipment, social distancing, recognizing signs of COVID-19, and reporting procedures. Our cruise line and destination resort employees receive training regarding compliance with the GPS protocols as they return to work.

• | Culture and Ethics. We strive to bring our culture of ethical behavior to the forefront of our organization. We visited over 1,200 global ports of call and operated 69 destination resorts in over 13 countries as of December 31, 2019; our values and our mission

are what bind our business together. We have instituted best practices to ensure that we continue to operate to the highest standards, including requiring all our employees to familiarize themselves during the training with, and adhere strictly to, our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and other corporate policies.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Training and Development. Our business relies on the ever-changing needs and desires of our customer base. These changes require that our employees are armed with best-in-class training and development in emerging areas of health and wellness. We also operate in areas that are subject to regulation and licensing. To respond to these challenges, we have developed extensive training and licensing practices. Our efforts include training at our London Wellness Academy and our satellite training facilities in South Africa and the Philippines, ranging from two to six weeks depending on the profession and modality of each employee, onboard training for certain of our shipboard employees, and management training courses at our Coral Gables office. All our employees are required to complete sexual harassment training, and our shipboard employees also complete health and safety training upon boarding the vessels on which they serve. Certain shipboard employees also complete additional training on safe practices in providing our services and training on cleaning and sanitization of our equipment and spa facilities. Our employees also receive training using our comprehensive “GPS” manual prior to returning to work.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We encourage our employees to progress through roles of increasing responsibility within our corporate structure during their tenures by providing numerous opportunities for development and training support. Most senior positions held by our Coral Gables and London Wellness Academy employees are occupied by individuals who began their careers as members of our shipboard spa teams. In our corporate office in Coral Gables, employees receive annual refresher and development training through the Company’s state of the art learning management system and are required to review a variety of learning modules containing training content relevant to our globally diverse organization. 
  
• | Succession Planning. The success of our business relies on the steady and experienced leadership of key employees. We continually strive to foster the personal and professional development of senior management and other critical roles throughout the organization. As a result, we have developed a strong group of leaders with lengthy tenures. The performance of our senior management team members is subject to ongoing monitoring and evaluation, intended to ensure efficient identification of potential successors and smooth transitions within the team.
