ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Background 
 Green Thumb Industries Inc. is a reporting issuer in the United States and Canada listed for trading on the Canadian Securities Exchange (CSE) under the symbol GTII. The Companys Subordinate Voting Shares (as hereinafter defined) are also traded in the United States on the OTCQX Best Market (the OTCQX) under the symbol GTBIF. 
 Originally founded in 2014, Green Thumb began operations in 2015 upon the award of a medical marijuana license for cultivation/processing and retail sale of cannabis in Illinois. The Company has since expanded its operational footprint to 12 U.S. markets, including California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Currently, Green Thumb owns, manufactures, and distributes a portfolio of cannabis consumer packaged goods brands including Beboe, Dogwalkers, Dr. Solomons, incredibles, Rythm and The Feel Collection, primarily to third-party retail stores across the United States as well as to Green Thumb owned retail stores. The Company also owns and operates retail cannabis stores that include a rapidly growing national chain called Rise and, in the Las Vegas, Nevada and Pasadena, California areas, a chain of stores called Essence, as well as retail stores, operating under other names, all of which sell our products and third-party products (which we refer to as our Retail business). 
 The Company, through its subsidiaries, owns state-licensed medical and/or adult use marijuana businesses in California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania. We also license our intellectual property and certain brands to licensees in California and Colorado, and recently entered into a partnership with Cookies to rebrand our Essence store located on the Las Vegas, Nevada Strip as a Cookies store, subject to applicable regulatory approvals. The following organizational chart describes the organizational structure of the Company as of December 31, 2020. See Exhibit 21.1 to this document for a list of subsidiaries of the Company. All lines represent 100% ownership of outstanding securities of the applicable subsidiary unless otherwise noted in Exhibit 21.1. In part, the complexity of our organization structure is due to state licensing requirements that mandate that we maintain the corporate identity of our operating license holders.

 The registered office of the Company is located at 250 Howe Street, 20th Floor, Vancouver, British Columbia V6C 3R8. The head office is located at 325 W. Huron Street, Suite 700, Chicago, Illinois 60654. 
 History of the Company 
 The Company was incorporated under the Company Act (British Columbia) on June 26, 1979 under the name Dalmatian Resources Ltd. On February 18, 2002, the Company changed its name to Enwest Ventures Corp. Further, on February 25, 2003, the Company changed its name to Bayswater Ventures Corp. In August 2006, the Company changed its name from Bayswater Ventures Corp. to Bayswater Uranium Corporation following a Canadian amalgamation transaction with Pathfinder Resources Ltd. 
 On July 18, 2007, under a plan of arrangement, the Company amalgamated with Kilgore Minerals Ltd., a company incorporated under the Canada Business Corporations Act (the CBCA) on June 21, 2002 and continued into the Province of British Columbia under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) (the BCBCA) on December 7, 2006. Following the plan of arrangement, Kilgore Minerals Ltd. changed its name to Bayswater Uranium Corporation on July 24, 2007. 
 Subsequent to the Companys financial year ended February 28, 2018, the Company completed the Transaction (as hereinafter defined), filed Articles of Amendment in the Province of British Columbia to effect the name change from Bayswater Uranium Corporation to Green Thumb Industries Inc. and continued the business of VCP23, LLC (VCP). VCP was formed in the State of Delaware on November 27, 2017. 
 General Development of the Business 
 The Transaction 
 On January 1, 2018, the Corporation completed a restructuring to consolidate its organizational structure. RCP23, LLC, which had operations in Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada and Pennsylvania, and GTI-Clinic Illinois Holdings, LLC, which had operations in Illinois, restructured and each entity contributed certain assets and real estate to VCP or its subsidiaries. Simultaneously, GTI-Clinic Illinois Holdings, LLC transferred its membership interests in the Illinois licensed medical businesses to GTI Core, LLC. Prior to the closing of the Transaction, VCP was acquired by GTI23, Inc. (GTI23) and the members of VCP exchanged their membership interests in VCP in exchange for shares of GTI23. The transaction did not include outside parties that were not previously members of RCP23, LLC or GTI clinic Illinois Holdings, LLC. The transaction did involve certain current directors and officers of the Corporation that, at the time, were members of RCP23, LLC and/or GTI Clinic Illinois Holdings, LLC. 
 On June 12, 2018, the Company, 1165318 B.C. Ltd. a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bayswater (Subco), VCP, GTI23 and GTI Finco Inc. (GTI Finco) entered into a Business Combination Agreement whereby the Company, Subco, VCP, GTI23 and GTI Finco combined their respective businesses (the Transaction). The Transaction was structured as a series of transactions, including a Canadian three-cornered amalgamation transaction and a series of U.S. reorganization steps for the purpose of raising capital from third-party investors simultaneously with the closing of the Transaction. The Company (formerly Bayswater) had no active business operations leading up to completion of the Transaction. 
 In connection with the Transaction, the Company disposed of its uranium-based assets, changed its name from Bayswater Uranium Corporation to Green Thumb Industries Inc. and consolidated its existing common shares on the basis of one Subordinate Voting Share for each 368 existing common shares of the Company. 
 At a meeting of the Companys shareholders on June 11, 2018, the shareholders approved a resolution to restructure the Companys share capital to, among other things, re-designate its existing common shares as subordinate voting shares (Subordinate Voting Shares) and create a class of multiple voting shares (Multiple Voting Shares) and super voting shares (Super Voting Shares).

 The Company, Subco and GTI Finco were parties to a Canadian three-cornered amalgamation (the Amalgamation) whereby: 
 

(i) | GTI Finco shareholders received Subordinate Voting Shares of the Company on a one-for-one basis;
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(ii) | members of VCP contributed their membership interests to GTI23 for shares of GTI23; and
-----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(iii) | members of VCP then contributed their shares of GTI23 to GTI in exchange for Super Voting Shares and Multiple Voting Shares of GTI.
------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The SR Offering 
 Prior to the Transaction, GTI Finco (a special purpose corporation wholly-owned by VCP), completed a brokered and a non-brokered subscription receipt financing at a price of C$7.75 per subscription receipt for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately C$87 million (the SR Offering). As part of closing the Transaction, the investors in the SR Offering received Subordinate Voting Shares of Green Thumb on an economically equivalent basis. The brokered portion of the SR Offering was co-led by GMP Securities L.P. and Canaccord Genuity Corp., with a syndicate that included Beacon Securities Limited, Echelon Wealth Partners Inc. and Eight Capital Corp. In connection with the Transaction and pursuant to the SR Offering, a total of 11,245,434 Subordinate Voting Shares were issued and outstanding after completion of the Transaction, including Subordinate Voting Shares issued to former holders of GTI Finco subscription receipts issued in the SR Offering. 
 The Subordinate Voting Shares began trading on the CSE on June 13, 2018 under the symbol GTII. 
 Financing Activities 
 On June 12, 2020, the Company closed on a $1.8 million mortgage loan from a third party to acquire the real estate of our Joliet, Illinois retail dispensary facility, which we refer to as the Joliet Mortgage Loan. The real estate was acquired from Mosaic Real Estate Joliet, LLC, which had previously been managed by Ms. Berger, as a principal of South Creek 15, LLC, which is the Manager of Mosaic Real Estate Joliet, LLC, until May 20, 2020 when Ms. Berger resigned from such position. Under the long-term mortgage loan, we will make monthly principal and interest payments. The purchase price for the property was $1.8 million, including transaction costs. 
 On March 6, 2020, the Company closed on a sale and lease back transaction to sell its Oglesby, Illinois cultivation and processing facility to an unrelated third party, Innovative Industrial Properties (IIP). Under a long-term agreement, the Company leased back the facility and continues to operate and manage it. The purchase price for the property was $9.0 million, excluding transaction costs.

 On May 22, 2019, the Company closed a $105 million senior secured non-brokered private placement financing through the issuance of three-year senior secured notes (the Notes) pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement (the Note Purchase Agreement). The financing generated funds for general working capital purposes and various growth initiatives and to retire the Companys existing debt, including the $12.5 million in six-month senior secured promissory notes, which we refer to as the Bridge Notes. Following our May 21, 2020 exercise of our option to extend the term of the Notes by one year, the Notes have a maturity date of May 22, 2023 and will bear interest from the date of issue at 12% per annum, payable quarterly. Upon the execution of the Note Purchase Agreement, the Purchasers of the Notes received warrants to purchase 1,822,771 Subordinate Voting Shares at an exercise price of C$19.39 per share, which can be exercised for 60 months from the date of issuance. The Company entered into the First Amendment to the Note Purchase Agreement (the Note Purchase Agreement Amendment) on November 9, 2019. The Note Purchase Agreement Amendment reduced the borrowing capacity from $150 million to $130 million, which allows the Company to borrow an additional $24.5 million over a period of 12 months from the closing date of the Note Purchase Agreement. Upon the execution of the Note Purchase Agreement Amendment, the Purchasers of the Notes received warrants to purchase 365,067 Subordinate Voting Shares at an exercise price of C$12.04 per share, which can be exercised for 60 months from the date of issuance.

The Bridge Notes included warrants to purchase 218,964 Subordinate Voting Shares at an exercise price of C$22.90 per share, which can be exercised for 42 months from the closing date of the transaction. On May 22, 2019, the Company repaid the full principal amount and accrued interest for the Bridge Notes. 
 On October 17, 2018, the Company closed a $78.6 million (C$101.7 million) bought deal financing, which included proceeds from the sale of Subordinate Voting Shares following the full exercise by the underwriters, namely GMP Securities L.P. (as lead underwriter and sole bookrunner), Beacon Securities Limited, Cormark Securities Inc., Echelon Wealth Partners Inc. and Eight Capital Corp., of an over-allotment option. The financing generated funds for the Companys continued growth, including wholesale capacity, strategic initiatives and general corporate purposes. 
 On August 2, 2018, the Company closed a $61.7 million (C$80.3 million) bought deal financing, co-led by Canaccord Genuity Corp. and GMP Securities L.P., and including Beacon Securities Limited, Echelon Wealth Partners Inc. and Eight Capital Corp., to fund the Companys continued growth, including the acquisition of one of ten licenses in the regulated New York cannabis market and the buildout of five dispensaries in Ohio pursuant to licenses awarded by the Ohio State Board of Pharmacy in June 2018, and for working capital purposes. 
 On June 12, 2018, GTI Finco (a special purpose corporation wholly-owned by VCP), completed the SR Offering, a brokered and a non-brokered subscription receipt financing at a price of C$7.75 per subscription receipt for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $64.1 million (C$87 million). The investors received 11,245,434 Subordinate Voting Shares on an economically equivalent basis.

 On April 30, 2018, the Company closed a private placement offering to sell $45 million in a convertible promissory note (Convertible Promissory Note) to VCP Convert, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company owned by accredited investors. The Convertible Promissory Note was converted into common units of VCP immediately prior to the Transaction. 
 Certain Recent Developments 
 On February 8, 2021, the SEC declared effective, the Companys Registration Statement No. 333-248213 on Form S-1 filed on February 2, 2021. Shortly thereafter, the Company received an offer from a single institutional investor to purchase 3,122,073 of the Subordinate Voting Shares registered on the Form S-1 at a price of $32.03 per share for a total of $100,000,030. The transaction closed on February 9, 2021. On February 23, 2021, the Company accepted additional offers to purchase a total of 1,571,917 Subordinate Voting Shares at a price of $35.50 per share, for a total of $55,803,054. 
 On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide. The Company is monitoring this closely, and although operations have not been materially affected by the COVID-19 outbreak to date, the ultimate severity of the outbreak and its impact on the economic environment is uncertain. Operations of the Company are currently ongoing as the cultivation, processing and sale of cannabis products is currently considered an essential business by the states in which we operate with respect to all customers (except in Massachusetts, where cannabis was deemed essential only for medical patients, leading to the state-wide suspension of adult use sales from March 24, 2020 to May 25, 2020). During 2020, the Companys revenue, gross profit and operating income were not negatively impacted by COVID-19 and the Company generally maintained the consistency of its operations. However, the uncertain nature of the spread of COVID-19 and its variants may impact the Companys business operations for reasons including the potential quarantine of Green Thumb employees or those of its supply chain partners and our designation as essential in states where we do business that currently or in the future impose restrictions on business operations. 
 On August 23, 2019, the Company closed on its acquisition of Fiorello Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Fiorello). Fiorello is one of only ten companies in New York licensed to grow, process and dispense medical cannabis. Fiorello has one cultivation/processing facility and four dispensing locations, with three of such dispensing locations currently operating. 
 On June 5, 2019, the Company closed on its acquisition of Integral Associates, LLC (Integral Nevada), a leading cannabis operator in Nevada, and Integral Associates CA, LLC (Integral California, together with Integral Nevada, Integral Associates). In addition to the initial consideration paid at closing, the membership interest purchase agreement (the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement) provides for the payment by the Company of additional consideration upon the achievement of certain performance targets (including a potential EBITDA earn-out payment) and regulatory license awards. Milestone payments for each license won are 50% payable at the initial license award, and the remaining 50% will be paid once the final licenses are issued. The total consideration was approximately $326 million, including $52 million in cash and 24.7 million Subordinate Voting Shares. The acquisition includes: (i) Integral Associates three Essence retail stores located across the Las Vegas, Nevada area; (ii) eight additional adult use retail licenses in Nevada, five in the Las Vegas area and three in Northern Nevada; (iii) West Hollywood, California retail license, one of only five with a consumption lounge and delivery service; (iv) Pasadena, California and Culver City, California retail licenses; (v) Desert Grown Farms, a 54,000 square foot state-of-the-art cultivation and processing facility with an award-winning genetics library of 100+ strains; and (vi) Cannabiotix NV, a 41,000 square foot cultivation and processing facility which has been a recognized High Times Cannabis Cup award winner. 
 On February 21, 2019, the Company closed on its acquisition of For Success Holding Company, the Los Angeles-based creator of the lifestyle suite of Beboe branded cannabis products. Beboe is best known for, among other things, the thoughtfully designed aesthetic of its iconic rose gold vaporizing pens and edible pastilles, with 
 
6 


  each product curated using a unique blend of socially dosed THC (as hereinafter defined) and CBD (as hereinafter defined). The acquisition was an all-stock transaction, and consideration was satisfied through the issuance of Subordinate Voting Shares. The purchase agreement also includes additional consideration based on future performance targets. 
 On February 12, 2019, the Company closed on its acquisition of Connecticut-based Advanced Grow Labs LLC (AGL). AGL is one of four companies in Connecticut licensed to grow and process cannabis. AGL operates a 41,000 square foot manufacturing facility in West Haven, Connecticut, with expansion potential. AGL also has an ownership stake in a dispensary that is located in Westport, Connecticut. AGL produces and distributes a wide range of cannabis products to the operating stores in the state. The transaction consideration was approximately $108.7 million including 7.3 million Subordinate Voting shares valued at $85.1 million and $15.5 million in cash. The purchase agreement also includes additional consideration based on future performance targets. 
 On November 8, 2018, the Company acquired KSGNF, LLC, the holder of a license to operate a vertically-integrated medical marijuana treatment center in Florida, in exchange for approximately $48.6 million in cash and Subordinate Voting shares valued at approximately $49.6 million. KSGNF, LLC operates a cultivation/processing facility in Homestead, Florida with six open and operating dispensaries across the state. 
 Description of the Business 
 Overview of the Company 
 Established in 2014 and headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, Green Thumb is promoting well-being through the power of cannabis through branded consumer packaged goods and people-first retail experiences, while being committed to community and sustainable profitable growth. As of December 31, 2020, Green Thumb has operations across 12 U.S. markets, employs over 2,200 people and serves hundreds of thousands of patients and customers annually. 
 Green Thumbs core business is manufacturing, distributing and marketing a portfolio of owned cannabis consumer packaged goods brands (which we refer to as our Consumer Packaged Goods business), including Beboe, Dogwalkers, Dr. Solomons, incredibles, Rhythm, and The Feel Collection. The Company distributes and markets these products primarily to third-party licensed retail cannabis stores across the United States as well as to Green Thumb-owned retail stores (which we refer to as our Retail business). 
 The Companys Consumer Packaged Goods portfolio is primarily generated from plant material that Green Thumb grows and processes itself which we use to produce our consumer packaged goods produced in 13 owned and operated manufacturing facilities. This portfolio consists of stock keeping units (SKUs) across a range of cannabis product categories, including flower, pre-rolls, concentrates, vape, capsules, tinctures, edibles, topicals and other cannabis-related products (none of which product category are individually material to the Company). These Consumer Package Goods products are sold in retail locations throughout the 12 U.S. markets Green Thumb operates in including Green Thumbs own Rise and Essence dispensaries. 
 Green Thumb owns and operates a national cannabis retail chain called Rise, and in the Las Vegas, Nevada area, a chain of stores called Essence, which are relationship-centric retail experiences aimed to deliver a superior level of customer service through high-engagement consumer interaction, a consultative, transparent and education-forward selling approach and a consistently available assortment of cannabis products. In addition, we own stores under other names, primarily where we co-own the stores or naming is subject to licensing or similar restrictions. The income from Green Thumbs retail stores is primarily from the sale of cannabis-related products, which includes the sale of Green Thumb produced products as well as those produced by third parties, with an immaterial (under 10%) portion of this income resulting from the sale of other merchandise (such as t-shirts and accessories for cannabis use). The Rise stores currently are located in eight of the states in which we 
 
7 


  operate (including Nevada). The Essence stores were acquired in connection with the 2019 acquisition of Integral Associates and are located in Nevada. The Essence stores differ from the Rise stores mainly in geographic location. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had 51 open and operating retail locations. The Companys new store opening plans will remain fluid depending on market conditions, obtaining local licensing, construction and other permissions and subject to the Companys capital allocation plans and the evolving situation with respect to the Coronavirus. 
 Financial Highlights and Revenue Streams 
 The Company has consolidated financial statements across its operating businesses with revenue from the manufacture, sale and distribution of branded cannabis products to third-party licensed retail customers as well as the sale of finished products to consumers in its retail stores. 
 The percentage of total revenue contributed by operations of Consumer Package Goods segment was 29%, 36% and 33% for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 respectively. The percentage of total revenue contributed by the Retail segment was 71%, 64% and 67% for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. See Item 7Management Discussion and Analysis for details on key financial highlights. 
 As of the year ended December 31, 2020, Green Thumb has operating revenue in 12 markets (California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New York, New Jersey, Ohio and Pennsylvania). 
 Geographic Information 
 Green Thumb operates in 12 U.S. states: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania. 
 

Product Research, Design and Development 
 The Companys branded products portfolio includes stock keeping units (SKUs) across a range of product categories, including flower, pre-rolls, concentrates, vape, capsules, tinctures, edibles, topicals and other cannabis-related products. 
 
8 


 Green Thumb engages in research and development activities focused on developing new extracted or infused cannabis consumer packaged products. 
 Manufacturing 
 Our branded products are produced in manufacturing facilities across 12 U.S. states in which the primary activity is the cultivation, processing and manufacture of cannabis consumer packaged goods. 
 The majority of our finished goods production is manufactured by our owned production facilities. However, we also have entered into manufacturing agreements with third parties, primarily for our cannabidiol (CBD) business lines, none of which account for more than 1% of finished goods production. 
 We aim to maintain strict brand and quality assurance standards and have implemented standard operating procedures across all production facilities to ensure continuity of product and consistent consumer experience across all operating markets. 
 Sources and Availability of Materials 
 Almost all of the raw material input, except packaging materials, used by the Company to produce finished cannabis consumer packaged goods are cultivated or processed internally for further use in the manufacturing process. 
 Significant Customers 
 Customers of our consumer packaged goods business include legal state-licensed cannabis dispensaries within each U.S. state in which we operate, as well as national retail channels, including department stores and specialty boutiques. The majority of our branded consumer packaged goods are distributed to unrelated third-party licensed retail cannabis stores. Green Thumb is not dependent upon a single customer, or a few customers, the loss of any one or more of which would not have a material adverse effect on the business. No customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated net revenue during fiscal 2020, 2019 or 2018. 
Merchandise 
 To meet the array of unique customer needs, we offer a variety of cannabis products at each of our Rise, Essence and other stores, totaling thousands of SKUs in managed inventory, comprehensive of product categories including flower, concentrates, topicals (bath and beauty products) and edibles (confection, beverages, snacks). 
 We leverage our owned retail channel, Rise, Essence and our other stores to distribute our branded product portfolio, such as Beboe, Dogwalkers, Dr. Solomons, incredibles, Rythm and The Feel Collection, among others. 
 All products sold have passed state-mandated third-party testing as required by applicable law to help assure that they do not contain impermissible levels of toxins, microbials and other harmful substances, are inventoried in comprehensive seed-to-sale tracking software to minimize product slippage and deviated inventory and meet the Companys vendor requirements for quality assurance and reliability. 
 Omnichannel Distribution 
 Products sold at our Rise, Essence and other stores are delivered directly to our stores primarily by our manufacturing and distribution vendor partners.

 Our primary retail presence is traditional brick and mortar. However, as regulations allow, we expect to continue to expand our e-commerce, in-store guest pick-up and direct to consumer delivery capabilities as part of our commitment to providing a consistent retail brand experience no matter where the consumer might be. 
 Intellectual PropertyPatents and Trademarks 
 We believe that brand protection is critical to our business strategy. We regularly seek to protect our intellectual property rights in connection with our operating names (e.g., Green Thumb and Rise), our consumer packaged goods (e.g., Dogwalkers and Rythm) and certain patentable goods and services. The U.S. trademark statute, The Lanham Act, allows for the protection of trademarks and service marks on products and services used, or intended for use, lawfully. Because cannabis-related products and services remain illegal at the federal level under the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. § 811), we are not able to fully protect our intellectual property at the federal level; therefore, we currently seek trademark protections at the state level where commercially feasible. Nonetheless, our success depends upon other areas of our business such as product development and design, production and marketing and not exclusively upon trademarks, patents and trade secrets. 
 The Company relies on non-disclosure/confidentiality agreements to protect its intellectual property rights. To the extent the Company describes or discloses any proprietary cultivation or extraction techniques in its applications for cultivation or processing licenses, the Company redacts or requests redaction of such information prior to public disclosure. 
 The Company has sought U.S. patent protection for certain of its Dr. Solomons products, namely a utility patent for compositions and methods for treating skin and neuropathic conditions and disorders. Where commercially reasonable, we will seek further U.S. patent protection on other eligible products and services. The Company owns several website domains, including www.gtigrows.com, numerous social media accounts across all major platforms and various phone and web application platforms. 
 The Company has successfully registered over 20 trademarks across state and country borders for brands offered within those jurisdictions and has additional trademark applications pending. The Company is in the process of registering several brands for state trademark protection at the U.S. federal level and/or in the states in which the brands are offered, including Beboe, Dogwalkers, Dr. Solomons, incredibles, Rythm and The Feel Collection. The Company anticipates feedback on outstanding submitted applications on a rolling basis. As such, the Company will continue to rely on common law protection for these brands during the trademark registration process. Moreover, the Company will proactively seek intellectual property protection for brand expansions in current markets as well as any new market expansion. For additional details on the risks associated with the lack of trademark protection, see Item 1ARisk Factors with respect to intellectual property. 
 For incredibles and Beboe branded cannabis products, the Company has entered into licensing and distribution contracts with third parties that hold licenses to engage in the sale of cannabis in the states of California and Colorado, where the Company does not currently have permission to operate cultivation and processing facilities. Such third parties directly engage in or arrange for the sourcing, manufacturing, laboratory testing, quality assurance, storage, marketing, sales, distribution and delivery of products containing cannabis and remit licensing fees to the Company. 
 Joint Ventures 
 We utilize joint ventures when necessary to comply with state regulatory requirements in certain states. Partnering with one or more non-affiliated third parties provide the Company with the opportunity to mitigate certain operational and financial risks while ensuring continued compliance with the applicable regulatory guidelines. Currently, the Company has joint ventures for a medical marijuana dispensary in Effingham, Illinois (NH Medicinal Dispensaries, LLC) of which the Company holds a 50% interest, and a medical marijuana dispensary in Westport, Connecticut (Bluepoint Wellness of Westport, LLC) of which the Company holds a 46% interest.

 Working Capital 
 Effective inventory management is critical to the Companys ongoing success and the Company uses a variety of demand and supply forecasting, planning and replenishment techniques. The Company strives to maintain sufficient levels of inventory of core product categories, maintain positive vendor and customer relationships and carefully plan to minimize markdowns and inventory write-offs. 
 For additional details on liquidity and Capital Resources, see Item 7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 Number of Employees 
 As of December 31, 2020, Green Thumb employs over 2,200 team members nationwide including corporate, retail, manufacturing, and part-time employees, including but not limited to: finance and accounting, legal and compliance, supply chain and operations, sales and marketing, commercial and cannabis agriculture, chemists, customer service, construction and project management, real estate and human resources. We offer a comprehensive package of company-sponsored benefits to our team. Eligibility depends on the full-time or part-time status, location and other factors, and benefits include 401(k), medical and dental plans, disability insurance, employee assistance programs and life insurance. Additionally, we believe in aligned incentives and utilize employee stock and incentive plans for a competitive total rewards program.   Our employees are split across the Company as follows: 
 

Corporate: | 160 
Retail: | 1,199
Manufacturing: | 864 
Total: | 2,223

Environmental Compliance 
 Expenditures for compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations are consistent from year to year and are not material to the Companys financials. The Company is compliant with all applicable regulations and does not use materials that would pose any known risk under normal conditions. 
 Competitive Conditions and the Companys Position in the Industry 
 Competition 
 The markets in which the Companys products are distributed and its retail stores are operated are highly competitive markets. The Companys operations exist in markets with relatively high barriers to entry given the licensed nature of the cannabis industry. The Company competes directly with cannabis producers and retailers within single-state operating markets, as well as those that operate across several U.S. markets. More broadly, Green Thumb views manufacturers of other consumer products, such as those in the pharmaceuticals, alcohol, tobacco, health and beauty and functional wellness industries, as potential competitors. Product quality, performance, new product innovation and development, packaging, customer experience and consumer price/value are important differentiating factors. 
 The Company faces intense competition from other companies that may have a longer operating history, a higher capitalization, additional financial resources, more manufacturing and marketing experience, greater access to public equity and debt markets and more experienced management than the Company. Increased competition by larger and better financed competitors could materially affect the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company. The vast majority of both manufacturing and retail competitors in our markets consist of localized businesses (i.e. doing business in only a single state market). There are a few 
 
11 


  multistate operators with whom the Company competes directly in several of the Companys operating markets. Aside from this direct competition, out-of-state operators that are capitalized well enough to enter those markets through acquisitions are also part of the competitive landscape. Similarly, as the Company executes its national U.S. growth strategy, operators in our future state markets will inevitably become direct competitors. 
 Because of the early stage of the industry in which the Company operates, the Company faces additional competition from new entrants. If the number of consumers of medical and adult use cannabis in the states in which the Company operates its business increases, the demand for products will increase and the Company expects that competition will become more intense, as current and future competitors begin to offer an increasing number of diversified products. To remain competitive, the Company will require a continued high level of investment in research and development, marketing, sales and client support. The Company may not have sufficient resources to maintain research and development, marketing, sales and client support efforts on a competitive basis, which could materially and adversely affect the business, financial condition and results of its operations. 
 See Item 1ARisk Factors with respect to competition. 
 Medical-Only Markets 
 All of the medical-only markets that the Company does business in (Connecticut, Florida, Maryland, New Jersey until February 22, 2021, New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania) have written regulations that impose our limitations on the number of cannabis business licenses that can be awarded. In each of these markets, we have a proven track record of: (i) entering the market through state-granted awards based on the merit of its application and business plans; and/or (ii) expanding market reach through accretive mergers, acquisitions, and partnership ventures. Each medical use market (including Illinois, California, Colorado, Massachusetts and Nevada, but excluding New Jersey, as described below) that also allow adult use has regulations specifying which medical conditions qualify a patient for a license to purchase cannabis, and generally require the approval or prescription from a physician. These applicable conditions can vary significantly from state to state, and in certain states, the qualifying conditions are amended from time-to-time.
In December 2019, the New Jersey state legislature passed a bill to add an initiative to the November 2020 ballot allowing voters to decide whether to legalize the sale of adult use cannabis in the state. New Jersey voters subsequently approved Question 1 with approximately 67% of the votes, legalizing the cultivation, processing and sale of adult use cannabis in the state. On February 23, 2021, Governor Phil Murphy signed three bills into law that establish an adult use program in New Jersey for adults who are at least 21 years old. On February 25, 2021, Governor Murphy announced his last picks to serve on the Cannabis Regulatory Commission, completing the panel that will undertake the job of regulating the legal marijuana industry and licensing new dispensaries and growers. It is not yet clear when New Jerseys adult use sales will begin. 
 Adult Use Markets 
 The adult use markets in which the Company operates in (Illinois, California, Colorado, Massachusetts and Nevada) have fewer barriers to entry and more closely reflect free market dynamics typically seen in mature retail and manufacturing industries. The growth of these markets poses a risk of increased competition. However, given our additional growth opportunities as an original operator in these states, which have historically been limited supply markets, management views the Companys market share as less at risk than operators without a current operating footprint as a result of our established brand recognition and supply and distribution chains, which were developed in those markets for medical use. Additionally, regulations in some adult use markets, such as Illinois, allowed us to quickly develop adult use market share in those states. Purchasers of adult use cannabis generally are subject to higher sales taxes than apply to purchasers who are authorized for medical purposes. However, anecdotal evidence suggests that some consumers who meet the criteria to apply for medical licenses make adult use purchases and avoid pursuing a states medical registration/qualification process.

 Overview of Government Regulation 
 Below is a discussion of the federal and state-level regulatory regimes in those jurisdictions where the Company is currently directly involved through its subsidiaries. The Companys subsidiaries are directly engaged in the manufacture, possession, sale or distribution of cannabis in the adult use and/or medicinal cannabis marketplace in the states of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania. As of December 31, 2020, 100% of our business was directly derived from U.S. cannabis-related activities. 
Federal Regulation of Cannabis 
 In 2005, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Congress has the power to regulate cannabis. 
 The U.S. federal government regulates drugs through the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. § 811), which places controlled substances, including cannabis, in a schedule. Cannabis is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance. A Schedule I controlled substance is defined as a substance that has no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of safety for use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse. The Department of Justice (the DOJ) defines Schedule I drugs, substances or chemicals as drugs with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse. However, the Food and Drug Administration (the FDA) has approved Epidiolex, which contains a purified form of the drug CBD, a non-psychoactive ingredient in the cannabis plant, for the treatment of seizures associated with two epilepsy conditions. The FDA has not approved cannabis or cannabis compounds as a safe and effective drug for any other condition. Moreover, under the 2018 Farm Bill or Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (the Farm Bill), CBD remains a Schedule I controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act, with a narrow exception for CBD derived from hemp with a tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) concentration of less than 0.3%. 
 Cannabis is largely regulated at the state level. 
 State laws that permit and regulate the production, distribution and use of cannabis for adult use or medical purposes are in direct conflict with the Controlled Substances Act, which makes cannabis use and possession federally illegal. Although certain states and territories of the U.S. authorize medical and/or adult use cannabis production and distribution by licensed or registered entities, under U.S. federal law, the possession, use, cultivation and transfer of cannabis and any related drug paraphernalia is illegal and any such acts are criminal acts under federal law under any and all circumstances under the Controlled Substances Act. Although the Companys activities are believed to be compliant with applicable state and local laws, strict compliance with state and local laws with respect to cannabis may neither absolve the Company of liability under U.S. federal law, nor may it provide a defense to any federal proceeding which may be brought against the Company. 
 As of December 31, 2020, 35 states, plus the District of Columbia (and the territories of Guam, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and the Northern Mariana Islands), have legalized the cultivation and sale of cannabis for medical purposes. In 15 of those states, the sale and possession of cannabis is legal for both medical and adult use, and the District of Columbia has legalized adult use but not commercial sale. In November 2020, voters in Arizona, Montana, New Jersey and South Dakota voted by referendum to legalize cannabis for adult use, and voters in Mississippi and South Dakota voted to legalized cannabis for medical use, and in February 2021, the Virginia legislature approved a bill that would legalize cannabis for adult use beginning in 2024. The Virginia bill is awaiting signature by the governor, and if signed, Virginia will be the first southern state to legalize cannabis for adult use. Also in February 2021, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy signed three bills into law that legalize cannabis for adult use. 
 The risk of federal enforcement and other risks associated with the Companys business are described in Item 1ARisk Factors.

 Regulation of the Cannabis Market at State and Local Level 
 Following the thesis that distributing brands at scale will win, we enter markets where we believe that we can profitably and sustainably operate and command significant market share, and thus maximize consumer and brand awareness. The regulatory frameworks installed by the states, which are similar to the limited and controlled issuance of gaming or alcohol distributorship licenses, provide macro-level indication of whether certain state markets will be sustainable and profitable. 
 Below is a summary overview of the regulatory and competitive frameworks in each of our operating markets. See Appendix A to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a state-by-state list of the licenses and permits held by us. 
 California 
 In 1996, California was the first state to legalize medical marijuana through Proposition 215, the Compassionate Use Act of 1996. This legalized the use, possession and cultivation of medical marijuana by patients with a physician recommendation for treatment of cancer, anorexia, AIDS, chronic pain, spasticity, glaucoma, arthritis, migraine or any other illness for which marijuana provides relief. In 2003, Senate Bill 420 was signed into law establishing an optional identification card system for medical marijuana patients. 
 In September 2015, the California legislature passed three bills collectively known as the Medical Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act (MCRSA). The MCRSA established a licensing and regulatory framework for medical marijuana businesses in California. In November 2016, voters in California overwhelmingly passed Proposition 64, the Adult Use of Marijuana Act (AUMA) creating an adult use marijuana program for adults 21 years of age or older. Some provisions of AUMA conflicted with MCRSA, so the California State Legislature passed Senate Bill No. 94, known as Medicinal and Adult Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act (MAUCRSA) in June 2017, amalgamating MCRSA and AUMA to provide a single set of regulations to govern a medical and adult use licensing regime for cannabis businesses in the State of California. MAUCRSA went into effect on January 1, 2018. 
 The three agencies that regulate cannabis at the state level are: (a) the California Department of Food and Agriculture, via CalCannabis, which issues licenses to cannabis cultivators; (b) the California Department of Public Health, via the Manufactured Cannabis Safety Branch, which issues licenses to cannabis manufacturers; and (c) the California Department of Consumer Affairs, via the Bureau of Cannabis Control, which issues licenses to cannabis distributors, testing laboratories, retailers and micro-businesses. 
 On June 6, 2018, a proposal by the California Department of Consumer Affairs, the California Department of Public Health and the California Department of Food and Agriculture to re-adopt their emergency cannabis regulations went into effect. Among the changes, applicants may now complete one license application, allowing for both medical and adult use cannabis activity. On January 16, 2019, Californias three state cannabis licensing authorities announced that the Office of Administrative Law officially approved state regulations for cannabis businesses. The final cannabis regulations took effect immediately and superseded the previous emergency regulations. 
 In order to legally operate a medical or adult use cannabis business in California, the operator must have both a local and state license. This requires license holders to operate in cities with cannabis licensing programs. Municipalities in California are allowed to determine the number of licenses they will issue to cannabis operators or can choose to ban cannabis businesses outright. 
 California License and Regulations 
 There are three principal license categories in California: (1) cultivation, (2) processing and (3) retailer. License holders are held to strict license renewal requirements. 
 
14 


 Cultivation licenses permit commercial cannabis cultivation activity involving the planting, growing, harvesting, drying, curing, grading or trimming of cannabis. Such licenses further permit the production, labeling and packaging of a limited number of non-manufactured cannabis products and permit the licensee to sell cannabis to certain licensed entities (both medical and adult use licensees) within the State of California for resale or manufacturing purposes. 
 Processing licenses authorize manufacturers to process marijuana biomass into certain value-added products with the use of volatile or non-volatile solvents, depending on the license type. 
 Retailer licenses permit the sale of cannabis and cannabis products to both medical patients and adult use customers. Only certified physicians may provide medicinal marijuana recommendations. An adult use retailer license permits the sale of cannabis and cannabis products to any adult 21 years of age or older. It does not require the individual to possess a physicians recommendation. Under the terms of such licenses, the holder is permitted to sell adult use cannabis and cannabis products to any person, provided the local jurisdiction permits the sale of adult use cannabis and the person presents a valid government-issued photo identification demonstrating that they are 21 years of age or older. 
 In February 2021, we received our first provisional operational license in the State of California. We have also been granted conditional licenses, permitting us to retail medical and adult use cannabis and cannabis related products. We have been awarded approval to proceed with the next steps in the application process for the entities listed on Appendix A to Annual Report on Form 10-K.
See Appendix A to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a list of the licenses issued to us with respect to our operations in California. 
 California Reporting Requirements 
 The California Cannabis Track-and-Trace (CCTT) system is the Track-and-Trace (T&T) system used statewide to record the inventory and movement of cannabis and cannabis products through the commercial cannabis supply chain from seed to sale. The CCTT system must be used by all annual and provisional cannabis licensees, including those with licenses for cannabis cultivation, manufacturing, retail, distribution, testing labs and microbusinesses. The states contracted service provider for the CCTT system is Marijuana Enforcement Tracking Regulation and Compliance (METRC). Licensees are required to maintain records for at least seven years from the date a record is created. 
 Colorado 
 On November 7, 2000, Colorado voters approved Amendment 20, which amended the state constitution to allow the use of marijuana in the state by approved patients with written medical consent. Conditions recognized for medical marijuana in Colorado include: cancer, chronic pain, epilepsy, HIV/AIDS, multiple sclerosis and nausea. 
 Amendment 64 passed on November 6, 2012, which amended the state constitution to establish a cannabis program in Colorado and permit the commercial cultivation, manufacture and sale of marijuana to adults 21 years of age or older. The commercial sale of marijuana for adult use to the general public began on January 1, 2014 at cannabis businesses licensed under the regulatory framework. 
 In Colorado, cannabis businesses must comply with local licensing requirements in addition to state licensing requirements in order to operate. Colorado localities are allowed to limit or prohibit the operation of marijuana cultivation facilities, product manufacturing facilities or retail dispensary facilities. 
 
15 


 Colorado License and Regulations 
 There are three principal license categories in Colorado: (1) cultivation, (2) product manufacturer and (3) medical center/retail store. Each facility is authorized to engage only in the type of activity for which it is licensed. A licensee must apply for renewal before the expiration date of a license. 
 We do not have any licenses in the State of Colorado. We have entered into licensing and distribution contracts with third parties that hold licenses to engage in the sale of cannabis in Colorado for incredibles and Beboe branded cannabis products. Such third parties directly engage in or arrange for the sourcing, manufacturing, laboratory testing, quality assurance, storage, marketing, sales, distribution and delivery of products containing cannabis and remit licensing fees to us. See Item 1Intellectual PropertyPatents and Trademarks for details on licenses with respect to operations in Colorado. 
 Regulations for the production and sale of marijuana in Colorado are published through the Marijuana Enforcement Division of the Department of Revenue. 
 See Appendix A to this Annual Report for a list of the licenses issued to us with respect to our operations in Colorado. 
 Colorado Reporting Requirements 
 Colorado uses METRC as the MEDs marijuana inventory tracking system for all medical and adult use licensees. Marijuana is required to be tracked and reported with specific data points from seed to sale through METRC for compliance purposes under Colorado marijuana laws and regulations. 
 Connecticut
The State of Connecticut has authorized cultivation, possession and distribution of marijuana for medical purposes by certain licensed Connecticut marijuana businesses. Over thirty medical conditions currently are recognized by the state to qualify a patient for medical marijuana certificate, including cancer, glaucoma, epilepsy and certain terminal and chronic pain conditions. The Medical Marijuana Program in Connecticut registers qualifying patients, primary caregivers, Dispensary Facilities and Dispensary Facility Employees. The Medical Marijuana Program in Connecticut was established by Connecticut General Statutes §§ 21a-40821a-429. Dispensary Facilities and production facilities are separately licensed. 
 Connecticuts medical cannabis program was introduced in May 2012 when the General Assembly passed legislation PA 12-55 An Act Concerning the Palliative Use of Marijuana. 
 The program launched with six dispensary licensees and four producer licensees. The first dispensaries sold to patients in September 2014. Subsequently, additional licensed dispensaries have become operational. 
 In January 2016, the Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection, the agency that oversees and administers the program, approved three additional dispensary licenses. In December 2018, the Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection issued nine additional dispensary licenses, bringing the total to 18 licensed dispensaries in the state. As of February 2021, all 18 of these dispensaries were operational. 
 Connecticut Licenses and Regulations 
 There are two principal license categories in Connecticut: (1) cultivation/processing and (2) dispensary. We are licensed to operate one medical marijuana cultivation/processing facility and three medical marijuana dispensaries. All licenses are, as of the date hereof, active with the State of Connecticut. The licenses are independently issued for each approved activity for use at our facilities in Connecticut. 
 The Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection has issued regulations regarding the Medical Marijuana Program in Connecticut. Patients with certain debilitating medical conditions qualify to participate in the Medical 
 
16 


  Marijuana Program in Connecticut. A physician or advanced practice registered nurse must issue a written certification for a Medical Marijuana Program in Connecticut patient, and the qualifying patient or caregiver must choose one designated Dispensary Facilities where the patients marijuana will be obtained. Under the Medical Marijuana Program in Connecticut, dispensary licenses are renewed annually. Renewal applications must be submitted 45 days prior to license expiration and any renewal submitted more than 30 days after expiration will not be renewed. 
 Medical marijuana cultivation/processing licenses permit us to operate a secure, indoor facility to cultivate and process medical marijuana and wholesale to dispensaries. 
 Medical marijuana dispensary facility licenses qualify a dispensary to purchase medical cannabis from licensed medical cannabis producers and to dispense cannabis to qualifying patients or primary caregivers that are registered under the Medical Marijuana Program in Connecticut. Dispensaries must have a pharmacist on staff. 
 See Appendix A to this Annual Report for a list of the licenses issued to us with respect to our operations in Connecticut. 
 Connecticut Reporting Requirements 
 Connecticut does not mandate the use of a particular unified T&T system by which all dispensary license holders submit data directly to the state. However, the Medical Marijuana Program in Connecticut does provide strict guidelines for reporting via the license holders T&T program. Every cannabis sale must be documented at the point of sale, including recording the date. At least once per day, all sales must be uploaded via the T&T system to the Connecticut Prescription Monitoring Program which accumulates and tracks medical cannabis purchases across all Connecticut dispensaries. 
 Florida
In 2014, the Florida Legislature passed the Compassionate Use Act, which was the first legal medical cannabis program in the states history. The original Compassionate Use Act only allowed for low-THC cannabis to be dispensed and purchased by patients suffering from cancer and epilepsy. In 2016, the Legislature passed the Right To Try Act which allowed for full potency cannabis to be dispensed to patients suffering from a diagnosed terminal condition. Also in 2016, the Florida Medical Marijuana Legalization Initiative was introduced by citizen referendum and passed on November 8. This language, known as Amendment 2, amended the state constitution and mandated an expansion of the states medical cannabis program. 
 Amendment 2, and the resulting expansion of qualifying medical conditions, became effective on January 3, 2017. The Florida Department of Health, physicians, dispensing organizations and patients are bound by Article X Section 29 of the Florida Constitution and Florida Statutes Section 381.986. On June 9, 2017, the Florida House of Representatives and Florida Senate passed respective legislation to implement the expanded program by replacing large portions of the existing Compassionate Use Act, which officially became law on June 23, 2017. 
 The State of Florida Statutes Section 381.986(8)(a) provides a regulatory framework that requires licensed producers, which are statutorily defined as Medical Marijuana Treatment Centers (which we refer to as MMTC), to cultivate, process and dispense medical cannabis in a vertically-integrated marketplace. 
 Florida Licenses and Regulations 
 There is one principal license category in Florida: vertically-integrated Medical Marijuana Treatment Centers license. We are licensed to operate one medical cannabis cultivation/processing facility and up to 35 medical dispensaries. All licenses are, as of the date hereof, active with the State of Florida. The licenses are independently issued for each approved activity for use at our facilities in Florida.

 There is a pending lawsuit that challenges important aspects of the 2017 legislation and Florida Department of Health, Office of Medical Marijuana Use, or OMMU, regulations that could have an impact on our business in Florida. In December 2017, Florigrown, LLC and other plaintiffs challenged as unconstitutional aspects of the 2017 legislation and OMMU regulations that: (1) require MMTCs to be vertically integrated (i.e., cultivate and process the cannabis to be sold at the MMTCs own licensed dispensaries); (2) that cap the total number of MMTC licenses in the state; and (3) that authorized the OMMU to issue MMTC licenses to certain applicants that met criteria defined by the 2017 legislation. On October 18, 2019, a trial judge in the Circuit Court for Leon County ruled that Florigrown, LLC had a substantial likelihood of succeeding on its claims, holding that the vertical integration and licensing cap conflicted with the language in Article X, Section 29 and that the provisions in the 2017 defining the criteria for eligibility for MMTC licensure constituted an impermissible special law under Article III, Section 11(a)(12) of the Florida Constitution. On July 10, 2019, an intermediate appellate court affirmed aspects of the Circuit Court for Leon Countys ruling. The matter is now pending before Florida Supreme Court. The Florida Supreme Court heard additional oral argument in the case on October 7, 2020. 
 Licenses are issued by the OMMU and must be renewed biennially. License holders can only own one license. Currently, the dispensaries can be in any geographic location within the state, provided that the local municipalitys zoning regulations authorize such a use, the proposed site is zoned for a pharmacy and the site is not within 500 feet of a church or school. 
 The Medical Marijuana Treatment Centers license permits us to sell medical cannabis to qualified patients to treat certain medical conditions in Florida, which are delineated in Florida Statutes Section 386.981. As our operations in Florida are vertically-integrated, we are able to cultivate, harvest, process and sell/dispense/deliver its own medical cannabis products. Under the terms of our Florida license, we are permitted to sell medical cannabis only to qualified medical patients that are registered with the State. Only certified physicians who have successfully completed a medical cannabis educational program can register patients on the Florida Office of Compassionate Use Registry. 
 See Appendix A to this Annual Report for a list of the licenses issued to us with respect to our operations in Florida. 
 Florida Reporting Requirements 
 The Florida Department of Health requires that any licensee establish, maintain and control a computer software tracking system that traces cannabis from seed to sale and allows real-time, 24-hour access by the Florida Department of Health to this data. The tracking system must allow for integration of other seed-to-sale systems and, at minimum, include notification of when marijuana seeds are planted, when marijuana plants are harvested and destroyed and when cannabis is transported, sold, stolen, diverted or lost. Additionally, the Florida Department of Health maintains a patient and physician registry, and we must comply with all requirements and regulations related to providing required data or proof of key events to the tracking system. 
 Illinois
In June 2019, the governor of Illinois signed legislation legalizing cannabis for adult use. The Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act, legalizing and regulating cannabis for recreational use, went into effect on June 25, 2019, and adult use sales of cannabis began in the state on January 1, 2020. The adult use program allowed existing medical cannabis license holders to apply for Early Approval Adult Use Dispensing Organization (EAAUDO) licenses to be able to sell adult use product at existing medical cannabis dispensaries (known as co-located or same site dispensaries) on January 1, 2020, and to have the privilege of opening a secondary adult use only retail site for every medical cannabis dispensary location the Dispensing Organization already had in its portfolio. All EAAUDO license holders were also required to commit to the states groundbreaking Social Equity program either through a financial contribution, grant agreement, donation, incubation program, or sponsorship program. The Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act also authorized issuance of an additional 75 Adult 
 
18 


  Use Dispensing Organization (AUDO) licenses in 2020 but to date those licenses have yet to be issued and it is uncertain when they will be issued. In addition, the Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act also authorized issuance up to 110 additional AUDO licenses by December 21, 2021. 
 We are licensed to grow and process cannabis for medical and adult use sales at our two cultivation facilities. As of December 31, 2020, we have nine operating dispensaries in Illinois and plan to open one more adult use only dispensary, which would bring us to the Illinois statutory cap of ten dispensaries. All of our original five medical dispensaries received licenses for co-located adult use sales, four of which are now fully operational. We have applied for and received four of the five secondary adult use dispensary state licenses we are eligible to receive, all four of which are fully operational. We expect to operationalize our fifth secondary license in the first quarter of 2021. All licenses are, as of the date hereof, active with the State of Illinois. The licenses are independently issued for each approved activity for use at our facilities in Illinois. 
 Illinois Licenses and Regulations 
 Illinois licenses four types of cannabis businesses within the state: (1) cultivation; (2) processing; (3) transportation; and (4) dispensary. We are licensed to grow and process cannabis for medical and adult use sales at our two cultivation facilities. Dispensaries require separate licenses for adult use sales and medical sales. As of December 31, 2020, we have nine operating dispensaries in Illinois (operating under 14 licenses) and plan to open one additional adult use only dispensary, which would bring us to the Illinois statutory cap of ten dispensaries operating under 15 licenses. We have five existing medical dispensary retail locations in Illinois. As part of each of our original five medical Illinois dispensary licenses, each medical dispensary was permitted to apply for (a) a license to sell to adult use customers in the same location, and (b) a license for a secondary location for sales to adult use customers only. All of our original five medical dispensaries received licenses for co-located adult use sales, four of which are now fully operational, and one of which remains subject to local zoning approval. We have applied for and received four of the five secondary adult use dispensary state licenses we are eligible to receive, all four of which are fully operational. We have applied for and received conditional approval for the fifth secondary license, with final approval expected later this spring. The dispensaries with secondary licenses by law serve only adult use customers, not medical patients. All licenses are, as of the date hereof, active with the State of Illinois. The licenses are independently issued for each approved activity for use at our facilities in Illinois. 
 All cultivation/processing establishments must register with Illinois Department of Agriculture. All dispensaries must register with the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation. If applications contain all required information, establishments are issued a marijuana establishment registration certificate. Registration certificates are valid for a period of one year and are subject to annual renewals after required fees are paid and the business remains in good standing. Pursuant to Illinois law, registration renewal applications must be received 45 days prior to expiration and may be denied if the license has a history of non-compliance and penalties. 
 The cultivation/processing licenses permit us to acquire, possess, cultivate, manufacture/process into edible marijuana products and/or marijuana-infused products, deliver, transfer, have tested, transport, supply or sell marijuana and related supplies to marijuana dispensaries. 
 The retail dispensary licenses permit us to purchase marijuana and marijuana products from cultivation/processing facilities, as well as allow the sale of marijuana and marijuana products. 
 See Appendix A to this Annual Report for a list of the licenses issued us with respect to our operations in Illinois.

 Illinois Reporting Requirements 
 The state of Illinois uses BioTrack as the states computerized track-and-trace system for seed-to-sale reporting. Individual licensees, whether directly or through third-party integration systems, are required to push data to the state to meet all reporting requirements. We use an in-house computerized seed-to-sale software, which integrates with the states BioTrack program and captures the necessary data points as required in the Illinois Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Program Act. 
 Maryland
In 2012, a state law was enacted in Maryland to establish a state-regulated medical marijuana program. Legislation was signed in May 2013 and the program became operational on December 1, 2017. The Maryland Medical Cannabis Commission regulates the state program and awarded operational licenses in a highly competitive application process. 102 dispensary licenses were awarded out of a pool of over 800 applicants, while an original 15 cultivation licenses were awarded out of a pool of over 150 applicants. In April 2018, Maryland lawmakers agreed to expand the states medical marijuana industry by authorizing an additional 20 licenses, seven for cultivation and 13 for processing. The state program was written to allow access to medical marijuana for patients with any condition that is considered severe for which other medical treatments have proven ineffective, including: chronic pain, nausea, seizures, glaucoma and PTSD. 
Maryland Licenses and Regulations 
 There are three principal license categories in Maryland: (1) cultivation, (2) processing and (3) dispensary. The Company has control and/or ownership over one cultivation license, one processing license and three retail dispensaries. All licenses are, as of the date hereof, active with the State of Maryland. The licenses are independently issued for each approved activity for use at the Company facilities in Maryland. 
 All cultivation, processing and dispensary establishments must register with the Maryland Medical Cannabis Commission under the provisions of the Maryland Medical Cannabis Law, Section 13-3301 et seq. If applications contain all required information, establishments are issued a medical marijuana establishment registration certificate. Registration certificates are valid for a period of six years and thereafter subject to renewal every two years, and are subject to strict renewal requirements. 
 The medical cultivation licenses permit us to acquire, possess, cultivate, deliver, transfer, have tested, transport, supply or sell marijuana and related supplies to medical marijuana dispensaries, facilities for the production of medical marijuana products and/or medical marijuana-infused products or other medical marijuana cultivation facilities. 
 The medical processing license permits us to acquire, possess, manufacture, deliver, transfer, transport, supply, or sell marijuana products or marijuana infused products to other medical marijuana production facilities or medical marijuana dispensaries. 
 The retail dispensary licenses permit us to purchase marijuana from cultivation facilities, marijuana and marijuana products from product manufacturing facilities and marijuana from other medical marijuana dispensaries, as well as allow the sale of marijuana and marijuana products. 
 See Appendix A to this Annual Report for a list of the licenses issued to us with respect to our operations in Maryland.

 Maryland Reporting Requirements 
 The state of Maryland uses METRC as the states computerized T&T system for seed-to-sale reporting. Individual licensees, whether directly or through third-party integration systems, are required to push data to the state to meet all reporting requirements. We use an in-house computerized seed-to-sale software, which integrates with the states METRC program and captures the required data points for retail as required in the Maryland Medical Cannabis Law. The Company uses METRC directly for cultivation and manufacturing. 
 Massachusetts
Massachusetts legalized medical marijuana when voters passed a ballot initiative in 2012. The Massachusetts Medical Use of Marijuana Program was formed pursuant to the Act for the Humanitarian Medical Use of Marijuana. Adult use marijuana became legal in Massachusetts as of December 15, 2016, following a ballot initiative in November 2016. Dispensaries for the adult use of cannabis in Massachusetts began operating in July 2018. 
 In Massachusetts, Registered Marijuana Dispensaries are vertically-integrated, which means Registered Marijuana Dispensaries grow, process and dispense their own marijuana. A Registered Marijuana Dispensary must have a retail facility, as well as cultivation and processing operations. Some Registered Marijuana Dispensaries elect to conduct cultivation, processing and retail operations all in one location, which is commonly referred to as a co-located operation. A Registered Marijuana Dispensary may also choose to have a retail dispensary in one location and grow marijuana at a remote cultivation location. A Registered Marijuana Dispensary may process marijuana at either a retail dispensary location or a remote cultivation location. The remote cultivation location need not be in the same municipality, or the same county, as the retail dispensary. 
Massachusetts Licenses and Regulations 
 There is one principal license category in Massachusetts: vertically-integrated Registered Marijuana Dispensaries license. We are licensed to operate one medical and adult use cultivation/processing facility and one medical and adult use retail dispensary. All licenses are, as of the date hereof, active with the State of Massachusetts. The licenses are independently issued for each approved activity for use at our facilities in Massachusetts. 
 The Massachusetts Department of Public Health was the regulatory body that oversaw the original Massachusetts medical program, including all cultivation, processing and dispensary facilities. The Cannabis Control Commission, a regulatory body created in 2018, now oversees the medical and adult use programs, including licensing of cultivation, processing and dispensary facilities. Licensed medical dispensaries are given priority status in adult use licensing. 
 Each Massachusetts dispensary, cultivator and processor license is valid for one year and is subject to strict license renewal requirements. 
 The Registered Marijuana Dispensaries license permits us to cultivate, process and dispense medical and adult use cannabis. 
 See Appendix A to this Annual Report for a list of the licenses issued to us with respect to our operations in Massachusetts.

 Massachusetts Reporting Requirements 
 The Commonwealth of Massachusetts uses the MMJ Online system through the Virtual Gateway portal as the states computerized T&T system for seed-to-sale reporting. Individual licensees, whether directly or through third-party integration systems, are required to push data to the state to meet all reporting requirements. We use an in-house computerized seed-to-sale software, which integrates with the states program and captures the required data points for cultivation, manufacturing and retail as required in the Massachusetts marijuana laws and regulations. 
 Nevada
Nevada became a medical marijuana state in 2001. In 2013, the Nevada legislature passed SB374, providing for state licensing of medical marijuana establishments. On November 8, 2016, Nevada voters passed NRS 435D by ballot initiative allowing for the sale of marijuana for adult use starting on July 1, 2017. In 2018, the Nevada Department of Taxation opened up applications for additional adult use marijuana dispensary licenses. Only those companies that held medical marijuana licenses in the state could apply. In December 2018, 61 additional marijuana dispensary licenses were issued by the Nevada Department of Taxation. 
Nevada Licenses and Regulations 
 There are three principal license categories in Nevada: (1) cultivation, (2) processing and (3) dispensary. We are licensed to operate two medical and adult use cultivation facilities, three medical and adult use processing facilities, five medical dispensary licenses and up to 13 adult use retail locations. All licenses are, as of the date hereof, active with the State of Nevada. The licenses are independently issued for each approved activity for use at our facilities in Nevada. 
 Under applicable laws, the licenses permit us to cultivate, manufacture, process, package, sell and purchase marijuana pursuant to the terms of the licenses, which are issued by the Nevada Department of Taxation under the provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes section 453A. If applications contain all required information, establishments are issued a marijuana establishment registration certificate. In a local governmental jurisdiction that issues business licenses, the issuance by Nevada Department of Taxation, or its successor as of July 1, 2020, the Nevada Cannabis Compliance Board, of a marijuana establishment registration certificate is considered provisional until the local government has issued a business license for operation and an establishment is in compliance with all applicable local governmental ordinances. Final registration certificates are valid for a period of one year and are subject to strict renewal requirements. 
 The cultivation licenses permit us to acquire, possess, cultivate, deliver, transfer, have tested, transport, supply or sell marijuana and related supplies to marijuana dispensaries, facilities for the production of edible marijuana products and/or marijuana-infused products or other marijuana cultivation facilities. 
 The processing license permits us to acquire, possess, manufacture, deliver, transfer, transport, supply or sell edible marijuana products or marijuana infused products to other marijuana production facilities or marijuana dispensaries. 
 The retail dispensary licenses permit us to purchase marijuana from cultivation facilities, marijuana and marijuana products from product manufacturing facilities and marijuana from other retail stores, as well as allow the sale of marijuana and marijuana products. 
 See Appendix A to this Annual Report for a list of the licenses issued to us with respect to our operations in Nevada.

 Nevada Reporting Requirements 
 The state of Nevada uses METRC as the states computerized T&T system for seed-to-sale reporting. Individual licensees, whether directly or through third-party integration systems, are required to push data to the state to meet all reporting requirements. We have designated an in-house computerized seed-to-sale software that integrates with METRC via API, which captures the required data points for cultivation, manufacturing and retail as required in Nevada Revised Statutes section 453A. 
 New Jersey
On January 18, 2010, the governor of New Jersey signed into law S.119, the Compassionate Use Medical Marijuana Act, permitting the use of medical cannabis for persons with certain debilitating conditions, including anxiety, cancer, chronic pain, post-traumatic stress disorder and seizure disorders. The law permits the New Jersey Department of Health to create rules to add other illnesses to the permitted conditions. The Compassionate Use Medical Marijuana Act mandates that cannabis must be acquired through Alternative Treatment Centers licensed by the State. 
 A single Alternative Treatment Centers license allows for the cultivation, processing and dispensing of medical marijuana products. Originally, each Alternative Treatment Centers was permitted to open one dispensary. With the Executive Order 6 Report, each Alternative Treatment Centers can now open two additional satellite dispensaries within their New Jersey Department of Health-designated region for a total of three dispensaries each, as well as satellite production facilities, subject to regulatory approval. 
 On March 27, 2018 through executive order No. 6 (2018), Governor Phil Murphy expanded the medical marijuana program, announcing the 20-plus recommendations presented by the New Jersey Department of Health on March 23, 2018. The New Jersey Department of Healths recommendations and next steps included certain measures that took effect immediately (e.g. the addition of debilitating conditions and the reduction of registration fees) and other recommendations (e.g. the home delivery model) that require further regulatory or statutory enactment. 
 On July 2, 2019, Governor Phil Murphy signed the Jake Honig Compassionate Use Medical Cannabis Act into law, which amended the Compassionate Use Medical Marijuana Act. Previously, New Jersey law only permitted applicants to apply for vertically-integrated licenses. Under the Jake Honig Compassionate Use Medical Cannabis Act, the permit process includes three different permit types. The new permit types are medical cannabis cultivator, dispensary and manufacturer permits, which are to be applied for individually. The vertically-integrated Alternative Treatment Centers will continue to be able to cultivate, manufacture and dispense medical cannabis. 
 In December 2019, the New Jersey state legislature passed a bill to add an initiative to the November 2020 ballot allowing voters to decide whether to legalize the sale of adult use cannabis in the state. New Jersey voters subsequently approved Question 1 with approximately 67% of the votes, legalizing the cultivation, processing and sale of adult use cannabis in the state. On February 23, 2021, Governor Phil Murphy signed three bills into law that establish an adult use program in New Jersey for adults who are at least 21 years old. On February 25, 2021, Gov. Murphy announced his last picks to serve on the Cannabis Regulatory Commission, completing the panel that will undertake the job of regulating the legal marijuana industry and licensing new dispensaries and growers. It is not yet clear when New Jerseys adult use sales will begin. 
 In November 2020, a New Jersey appellate court ruled that the state Department of Health must reconsider the applications of companies rejected during the 2018 licensing round, which is the licensing round in which our subsidiary was awarded a license. The companies alleged that the scoring was arbitrary. The appellate court remanded the issue back to the Department of Health but did not dictate what the Department of Health is to do. 
 
23 


 There is also a lawsuit pending against the state Department of Health related to a 2019 licensing round that was to expand the states medical marijuana program. State regulators requested applications in 2019 for 24 new licenses for vertically integrated and stand-alone businesses, including cultivators and retailers, but a court halted review of those applications after a lawsuit alleged that the system had technical glitches. To date the lawsuit has not been resolved. 
 New Jersey Licenses and Regulations 
 There is currently one principal license category in New Jersey: vertically-integrated Alternative Treatment Centers license. We are licensed to operate one medical cultivation and processing facility and up to three retail medical cannabis dispensaries in the state of New Jersey. All licenses are, as of the date hereof, active with the State of New Jersey. The licenses are independently issued for each approved activity for use at our facilities in New Jersey. 
 The New Jersey Department of Health is responsible for issuing permits and administering the Compassionate Use Medical Marijuana Act to ensure qualifying patients access to safe cannabis for medical use in New Jersey. 
 Alternative Treatment Center permits expire annually on December 31. Strict permit renewal application requirements apply. See Appendix A to this Annual Report for a list of the licenses issued to us with respect to our operations in New Jersey. 
 New Jersey Reporting Requirements 
 New Jersey does not have a unified T&T system. All information is forwarded to the medical marijuana program through email. The Alternative Treatment Center collects and submits to the New Jersey Department of Health for each calendar year statistical data on (a) the number of registered qualified patients and registered primary caregivers, (b) the debilitating medical conditions of the qualified patients, (c) patient demographic data, (d) summary of the patient surveys and evaluation of services and (e) other information as the New Jersey Department of Health may require. The Alternative Treatment Center must retain records for at least two years. We also use an in-house computerized seed-to-sale software, which captures the required data points for cultivation, manufacturing and retail as required in the New Jersey marijuana laws and regulations. 
 New York
In July 2014, the New York Legislature and Governor enacted the Compassionate Care Act to provide a comprehensive, safe and effective medical marijuana program. The Compassionate Care Act provides access to the program for those who suffer from qualifying serious conditions including: cancer, HIV/AIDS, ALS and post-traumatic stress disorder. The program allows ten Registered Organizations to hold vertically-integrated licenses and service qualified patients and caregivers. Each Registered Organization has one cultivation/processing license and four dispensary licenses. 
 Under the terms of licenses in the state of New York, licensees are permitted to sell medical marijuana manufactured products that are approved by the New York State Department of Health to any qualified patient who possesses a physicians recommendation, provided that the patient presents a valid government-issued photo identification and New York State Department of Health -issued Registry Identification Card proving that the patient or designated caregiver meets the statutory conditions to be a qualified patient or designated caregiver. The card contains the recommendation from the physician and the limitation on form or dosage of medical marijuana. In order for a patient or registered caregiver to receive dispensed marijuana, they must be logged into the Prescription Monitoring Program registry. The Prescription Monitoring Program registry is monitored by the New York State Department of Health and contains controlled substance prescription dispensing history and medical marijuana dispensing history to ensure that patients only receive up to the maximum allowable dispensed product from one Registered Organization. Only registered pharmacists can dispense medical marijuana to approved patients and caregivers.

 New York Licenses and Regulations 
 There is one principal license category in New York: vertically-integrated license. We are licensed to operate one medical marijuana cultivation/manufacturing facility and up to four medical marijuana dispensaries. All licenses are, as of the date hereof, active with the State of New York. The licenses are independently issued for each approved activity for use at our facilities in New York. 
 The New York State Department of Health is the regulatory agency that oversees the medical marijuana program in New York. New York is a vertically-integrated system; however, the state does allow Registered Organizations to wholesale manufactured products to one another. As such, we have the ability to be vertically-integrated and cultivate, harvest, process, transport, sell and dispense cannabis products. Delivery is allowed from dispensaries to patients, however the delivery plan must be pre-approved by the New York State Department of Health. 
 New York Reporting Requirements 
 The State of New York has selected BioTrackTHCs system as the states T&T system used to track commercial cannabis activity and seed-to-sale. The BioTrackTHC system must serve as all Registered Organizations patient verification system but is optional as Registered Organizations tracking system. We currently use BioTrackTHC as our seed-to-sale tracking system, we also integrate our in-house seed-to-sale tracking system with BioTrackTHC. 
 Every month the New York State Department of Health requests a dispensing report in Excel format, via email, showing all products dispensed for the month. This is the only report that we are required to submit to the New York State Department of Health. All other data is pulled by the New York State Department of Health directly from our seed-to-sale tracking system. 
 Ohio
House Bill 523, effective on September 8, 2016, legalized medical marijuana in Ohio. The Ohio Medical Marijuana Control Program allows people with certain medical conditions, upon the recommendation of an Ohio-licensed physician certified by the State Medical Board, to purchase and use medical marijuana. Over twenty medical conditions currently are recognized by the state to qualify a patient for a medical marijuana certificate, including cancer, glaucoma, epilepsy and certain terminal and chronic pain conditions. In November 2018, the state issued 12 Level I cultivation licenses, which permit up to 25,000 square feet of canopy, and 12 Level II cultivation licenses, which permit up to 3,000 square feet of canopy. In June 2018, the state issued 56 dispensary licenses. Subsequently, additional licenses have been granted. 
 By rule, the State of Ohio Board of Pharmacy is currently limited to issuing up to 60 dispensary licenses across the state. Under the program rules, the Board will consider, on at least a biennial basis, whether enough medical marijuana dispensaries exist, considering the state population, the number of patients seeking to use medical marijuana and the geographic distribution of dispensary sites. 
 Ohio License and Regulations 
 There are three principal license categories in Ohio: (1) cultivation, (2) processing and (3) dispensary. We are licensed to operate one medical marijuana cultivation facility, one medical marijuana processing facility and up to five retail medical marijuana dispensaries in the state of Ohio. All licenses are, as of the date hereof, active with the State of Ohio. The licenses are independently issued for each approved activity for use at our facilities in Ohio. 
 The three following state government agencies are responsible for the operation of Ohios Medical Marijuana Control Program: (1) the Ohio Department of Commerce oversees medical marijuana cultivators, 
 
25 


  processors and testing laboratories; (2) the State of Ohio Board of Pharmacy oversees medical marijuana retail dispensaries, the registration of medical marijuana patients and caregivers, the approval of new forms of medical marijuana and coordinating the Medical Marijuana Advisory Committee; and (3) the State Medical Board of Ohio certifies physicians to recommend medical marijuana and may add to the list of qualifying conditions for which medical marijuana can be recommended. 
 Certificates of operation for dispensaries carry two-year terms, while certificates of operation for cultivators and processors must be renewed annually and are subject to strict license renewal application requirements. 
 The medical cultivation licenses permit us to acquire, possess, cultivate, manufacture/process into medical marijuana products, deliver, transfer, have tested, transport, supply or sell marijuana and related supplies to medical marijuana dispensaries. The medical processor license permits us to manufacture and produce medical marijuana products. 
 The dispensary licenses will permit us to purchase marijuana and marijuana products from cultivation and/or processing facilities, as well as allow the sale of marijuana and marijuana products to registered patients. 
 See Appendix A to this Annual Report for a list of the licenses issued to us with respect to our operations in Ohio. 
 Ohio Reporting Requirements 
 Ohio uses METRC as its seed-to-sale tracking system. Licensees are required to use METRC in Ohio to push data to the state to meet all of the reporting requirements. We integrate our in-house seed-to-sale tracking system with METRC to capture the required data points as required in the Ohio medical marijuana laws and regulations. 
 Pennsylvania
The Pennsylvania medical marijuana program was signed into law on April 17, 2016 under Act 16 and provided access to state residents with one or more qualifying conditions, including: epilepsy, chronic pain and post-traumatic stress disorder. The state originally awarded only 12 licenses to cultivate/process and 27 licenses to operate retail dispensaries (which entitled holders to up to three medical dispensary locations per retail license). Subsequently, additional licenses have been granted. For example, on March 22, 2018, it was announced that the final phase of the Pennsylvania medical marijuana program would initiate its rollout, which included 13 additional cultivation/processing licenses and 23 additional dispensary licenses. Additionally, the list of qualifying conditions was expanded which had the effect of increasing the number of individuals that could qualify for medical marijuana cards. 
Pennsylvania Licenses and Regulations 
 There are two principal license categories in Pennsylvania: (1) cultivation/processing and (2) dispensary. Our subsidiary GTI Pennsylvania, LLC is licensed to operate a medical cultivation/processing facility and is also licensed to operate medical retail locations. Our subsidiary KW Ventures Holdings, LLC is also licensed to operate medical retail locations. All licenses are, as of the date hereof, active with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The licenses are independently issued for each approved activity for use at our facilities in Pennsylvania. 
 All cultivation/processing establishments and dispensaries must register with Pennsylvania Department of Health. Registration certificates are valid for a period of one year and are subject to strict annual renewal requirements. Under applicable laws, the licenses permit the license holder to cultivate, manufacture, process, package, sell and purchase medical marijuana pursuant to the terms of the licenses, which are issued by the Pennsylvania Department of Health under the provisions of Medical Marijuana Act and Pennsylvania regulations. 
 
26 


 The medical cultivation/processing licenses permit us to acquire, possess, cultivate, manufacture/process into medical marijuana products and/or medical marijuana-infused products, deliver, transfer, have tested, transport, supply or sell marijuana and related supplies to medical marijuana dispensaries. 
 The retail dispensary licenses permit the Company to purchase marijuana and marijuana products from cultivation/processing facilities, as well as allow the sale of marijuana and marijuana products. 
 See Appendix A to this Annual Report for a list of the licenses issued to us with respect to our operations in Pennsylvania. 
 Pennsylvania Reporting Requirements 
 Pennsylvania uses MJ Freeway as the states computerized T&T system for seed-to-sale reporting. Individual licensees are required to use MJ Freeway to push data to the state to meet all reporting requirements. We use MJ Freeway as our in-house computerized seed-to-sale software, which integrates with the states MJ Freeway program and captures the required data points for cultivation, manufacturing and retail as required in the Pennsylvania medical marijuana laws and regulations. 
State License Renewal Requirements 
 For each of our provisional and operational licenses, the states impose strict license renewal requirements that vary state by state. We generally must complete the renewal application process within a prescribed period of time prior to the expiration date and pay an application fee. The state licensing body can deny or revoke licenses and renewals for a variety of reasons, including (a) submission of materially inaccurate, incomplete or fraudulent information, (b) failure of the company or any of its directors or officers to comply, or have a history of non-compliance, with any applicable law or regulation, including laws relating to minimum age of customers, safety and non-diversion of cannabis or cannabis products, taxes, child support, workers compensation and insurance coverage, or otherwise remain in good standing (c) failure to submit or implement a plan of correction for any identified violation, (d) attempting to assign registration to another entity without state approval, (e) insufficient financial resources, (f) committing, permitting, aiding or abetting of any illegal practices in the operation of a facility, (g) failure to cooperate or give information to relevant law enforcement related to any matter arising out of conduct at a licensed facility and (h) lack of responsible operations, as evidenced by negligence, disorderly or unsanitary facilities or permitting a person to use a registration card belonging to another person. Certain jurisdictions also require licensees to attend a public hearing or forum in connection with their license renewal application. 
Compliance with Applicable Federal Law 
 We are in compliance with applicable cannabis licensing requirements and the regulatory framework enacted by each state in which it operates. We are not subject to any material citations or notices of violation of applicable licensing requirements or the regulatory framework enacted by each applicable state which may have an adverse impact on its licenses, business activities or operations. 
 We have in place a detailed compliance program and an internal legal and compliance department and are building out our operational compliance team across all states in which we operate. We also have external state and local regulatory/compliance counsel engaged in every jurisdiction in which we operate. 
 We provide training for all employees, including on the following topics: 
 

 | Compliance with state and local laws
--+-------------------------------------


 | Safe cannabis use
--+------------------


 | Dispensing procedures
--+----------------------

 
27 


 
 | Security and safety policies and procedures
--+--------------------------------------------


 | Inventory control
--+------------------


 | T&T training session
--+---------------------


 | Quality control
--+----------------


 | Transportation procedures
--+--------------------------

 We emphasize security and inventory control to ensure strict monitoring of cannabis and inventory, from delivery by a licensed distributor to sale or disposal. Only authorized, properly trained employees are allowed to access the Companys computerized seed-to-sale system. 
 We monitor all compliance notifications from the regulators and inspectors in each market and timely resolve any issues identified. We keep records of all compliance notifications received from the state regulators or inspectors, as well as how and when an issue was resolved. Moreover, we monitor news sources for information regarding developments at the state and federal level relating to the regulation and criminalization of cannabis. 
 Further, we have created comprehensive standard operating procedures that include detailed descriptions and instructions for receiving shipments of inventory, inventory tracking, recordkeeping and record retention practices related to inventory. We also have comprehensive standard operating procedures in place for performing inventory reconciliation, and ensuring the accuracy of inventory tracking and recordkeeping. We maintain accurate records of our inventory at all licensed facilities. Adherence to our standard operating procedures is mandatory and ensures that our operations are compliant with the rules set forth by the applicable state and local laws, regulations, ordinances, licenses and other requirements. We ensure adherence to standard operating procedures by regularly conducting internal inspections and ensure that any issues identified are resolved quickly and thoroughly. 
 Federal Law 
 The inconsistencies between federal and state regulation of cannabis were addressed in a memorandum which then-Deputy Attorney General James Cole sent to all U.S. District Attorneys in August 2013 outlining certain priorities for the Department of Justice relating to the prosecution of cannabis offenses. The Cole Memorandum acknowledged that, notwithstanding the designation of cannabis as a Schedule I controlled substance at the federal level, several states had enacted laws authorizing the use of cannabis for medical purposes. The Cole Memorandum noted that jurisdictions that have enacted laws legalizing cannabis in some form have also implemented strong and effective regulatory and enforcement systems to control the cultivation, processing, distribution, sale and possession of cannabis. As such, conduct in compliance with those laws and regulations is less likely to implicate the Cole Memorandums enforcement priorities. The Department of Justice did not provide (and has not provided since) specific guidelines for what regulatory and enforcement systems would be deemed sufficient under the Cole Memorandum. In light of limited investigative and prosecutorial resources, the Cole Memorandum concluded that the Department of Justice should be focused on addressing only the most significant threats related to cannabis, such as distribution of cannabis from states where cannabis is legal to those where cannabis is illegal, the diversion of cannabis revenues to illicit drug cartels and sales of cannabis to minors. 
 On January 4, 2018, former U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a new memorandum which rescinded the Cole Memorandum. The Sessions Memorandum stated, in part, that current law reflects Congress determination that cannabis is a dangerous drug and cannabis activity is a serious crime, and Mr. Sessions directed all U.S. Attorneys to enforce the laws enacted by Congress by following well-established principles when pursuing prosecutions related to cannabis activities. The Company is not aware of any prosecutions of investment companies doing routine business with licensed marijuana related businesses in light of the new 
 
28 


  Department of Justice position. However, there can be no assurance that the federal government will not enforce federal laws relating to cannabis in the future. As a result of the Sessions Memorandum, federal prosecutors are now free to utilize their prosecutorial discretion to decide whether to prosecute cannabis activities, despite the existence of state-level laws that may be inconsistent with federal prohibitions. No direction was given to federal prosecutors in the Sessions Memorandum as to the priority they should ascribe to such cannabis activities, and thus it is uncertain how active U.S. federal prosecutors will be in relation to such activities. 
 Federal prosecutors appear to continue to use the Cole Memorandums priorities as an enforcement guide. Merrick Garland, who became Attorney General on March 10, 2021 has indicated that he would deprioritize enforcement of low-level cannabis crimes such as possession, and has shared his view that the government should focus on large-scale criminal enterprises that circumvent state legalization laws instead of going after people who abide by local cannabis policies. The Company believes it is too soon to determine what prosecutorial effects will be created by the rescission of the Cole Memorandum or any replacement thereof and when or if the Sessions Memorandum will be rescinded. President Joseph R. Biden, who assumed office in January 2021, has not yet indicated whether and when he will decriminalize or legalize cannabis and has previously stated that he is opposed to legalization. The sheer size of the cannabis industry, in addition to participation by state and local governments and investors, suggests that a large-scale federal enforcement operation would more than likely create unwanted political backlash for the Department of Justice and the current administration. It is also possible that the change of Congressional leadership in January 2021 could change the priorities of Congress and encourage reconciliation of federal and state laws. Regardless, at this time, cannabis remains a Schedule I controlled substance at the federal level. The U.S. federal government has always reserved the right to enforce federal law in regard to the sale and disbursement of medical or adult use cannabis, even if state law authorizes such sale and disbursement. It is unclear whether the risk of enforcement has been altered. 
 On June 7, 2018, the STATES Act was introduced in the Senate by Republican Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado and Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. A companion bill was introduced in the House by Democratic representative Jared Polis of Colorado. The bill provides in relevant part that the provisions of the Controlled Substances Act, as applied to marijuana, shall not apply to any person acting in compliance with state law relating to the manufacture, production, possession, distribution, dispensation, administration, or delivery of marijuana. Even though marijuana will remain within Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act under the STATES Act, the bill makes the Controlled Substances Act unenforceable to the extent it conflicts with state law. In essence, the bill extends the limitations afforded by the protection within the federal budgetwhich prevents the Department of Justice and the Drug Enforcement Agency from using funds to enforce federal law against state-legal medical cannabis commercial activityto both medical and adult use cannabis activity in all states where it has been legalized. By allowing continued prohibition to be a choice by the individual states, the STATES Act does not fully legalize cannabis on a national level. In that respect, the bill emphasizes states rights under the Tenth Amendment, which provides that the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people. Under the STATES Act companies operating legal cannabis businesses would no longer be considered trafficking under the Controlled Substances Act, and this would likely assist financial institutions in transacting with individuals and businesses in the cannabis industry without the threat of money laundering prosecution, civil forfeiture and other criminal violations that could lead to a charter revocation. The STATES Act was reintroduced on April 4, 2019 in both the House and the Senate. Since the STATES Act is currently draft legislation, there is no guarantee that the STATES Act will become law in its current form. 
 One legislative safeguard for the medical cannabis industry, appended to the federal budget bill, remains in place following the rescission of the Cole Memorandum. For fiscal years 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, Congress adopted a so-called rider provision to the Consolidated Appropriations Acts (formerly referred to as the Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment and currently referred to as the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment) to prevent the federal government from using congressionally appropriated funds to enforce federal cannabis laws against regulated medical cannabis actors operating in compliance with state and local law. The Rohrabacher-Blumenauer 
 
29 


  Amendment was included in the fiscal year 2018 budget passed on March 23, 2018. The Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment was included in the consolidated appropriations bill signed into legislation by President Trump in February 2019. In signing the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment, President Trump issued a signing statement noting that the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment provides that the Department of Justice may not use any funds to prevent implementation of medical marijuana laws by various States and territories, and further stating I will treat this provision consistent with the Presidents constitutional responsibility to faithfully execute the laws of the United States. On June 20, 2019, the House approved a broader amendment that, in addition to protecting state medical cannabis programs, would also protect state adult use programs. On September 26, 2019, the Senate Appropriations Committee declined to take up the broader amendment but did approve the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment for the fiscal year 2020 spending bill. On September 27, 2019, the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment was renewed as part of a stopgap spending bill, in effect through November 21, 2019, and was then renewed through a series of stopgap spending bills passed in 2020. On December 27, 2020, the amendment was renewed through the signing of the fiscal year 2021 omnibus spending bill, effective through September 30, 2021. Despite the rescission of the Cole Memorandum, the Department of Justice appears to continue to adhere to the enforcement priorities set forth in the Cole Memorandum. Accordingly, as an industry best practice, the Company continues to employ the following policies to ensure compliance with the guidance provided by the Cole Memorandum: 
 

 | Our operations and our subsidiaries operations are compliant with all licensing requirements as established by the applicable state, county, municipality, town, township, borough and other political/administrative divisions; to this end, we retain appropriately experienced legal counsel to conduct the necessary due diligence to ensure compliance of such operations with all applicable state and local laws;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the cannabis-related activities adhere to the scope of the licensing obtainedfor example, in states where only medical cannabis is permitted, the products are only sold to patients who hold the necessary documentation to permit the possession of the cannabis; in states where cannabis is permitted for adult use, the products are only sold to individuals who meet the requisite age requirements;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | We only work through licensed operators, which must pass a range of requirements, adhere to strict business practice standards and be subject to strict regulatory oversight to ensure that no revenue is distributed to criminal enterprises, gangs or cartels;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | We have implemented an inventory tracking system and necessary procedures to ensure that such compliance system is effective in tracking inventory and preventing diversion of cannabis or cannabis products into those states where cannabis is not permitted by state law or cross any state lines in general;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Our state-authorized cannabis business activity is not used as a cover or pretense for trafficking of other illegal drugs, and we are not engaged in any other illegal activity or any activities that are contrary to any applicable anti-money laundering statutes; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | We conduct reviews of products and product packaging to ensure that the products comply with applicable regulations and contain necessary disclaimers about the contents of the products to prevent adverse public health consequences from cannabis use and prevent impaired driving.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Cole Memorandum and the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment gave licensed cannabis operators (particularly medical cannabis operators) and investors in states with legal regimes greater certainty regarding the Department of Justices enforcement priorities and the risk of operating cannabis businesses. While the Sessions Memorandum has introduced some uncertainty regarding federal enforcement, the cannabis industry continues to experience growth in legal medical and adult use markets across the United States. Attorney General Merrick Garland, who assumed office on March 10, 2021, has indicated that he would deprioritize enforcement of low-level cannabis crimes such as possession, and has shared his view that the government should focus on large-scale criminal enterprises that circumvent state legalization laws instead of going after people who abide by local cannabis policies. Vice President Kamala Harris is the lead sponsor of the Marijuana Opportunity, 
 
30 


  Reinvestment, and Expungement (MORE) Act, which seeks to end the federal prohibition of marijuana, among other things, but in March 2020, it was reported that Vice President Harris has adopted the same position as President Joseph R. Biden, who opposes legalization. Currently, there is no guarantee that state laws legalizing and regulating the sale and use of cannabis will remain in place or that local governmental authorities will not limit the applicability of state laws within their respective jurisdictions. Unless and until the United States Congress amends the Controlled Substances Act with respect to cannabis (and as to the timing or scope of any such potential amendments there can be no assurance), there is a risk that federal authorities may enforce current U.S. federal law criminalizing cannabis. 
 We will continue to monitor compliance on an ongoing basis in accordance with our compliance program and standard operating procedures. While our operations are in full compliance with all applicable state laws, regulations and licensing requirements, such activities remain illegal under federal law. For the reasons described above and the risks further described in the section entitled Risk Factors, there are significant risks associated with our business. Readers of this Form are strongly encouraged to carefully read all of the risk factors contained in Item 1ARisk Factors. 
 Ability to Access Public and Private Capital 
 Due to the present state of the laws and regulations governing financial institutions in the U.S., banks often refuse to provide banking services to businesses involved in the marijuana industry and U.S. multistate operators are currently not permitted to list securities on the U.S. exchanges. Consequently, it may be difficult for us to obtain financing from large U.S. financial institutions. 
 We have historically, and continue to have, access to equity and debt financing from non-public (i.e., private placement) markets and state-chartered financial institutions. Our executive team and Board have extensive relationships with sources of capital (such as funds and high net worth individuals). 
 In addition to our working capital, we continue to generate adequate cash to fund our operations from capital raising transactions, including: 
 

 | the Convertible Promissory Note;

 Our business plan continues to include aggressive growth, both in the form of additional acquisitions and through facility expansion and improvements. Accordingly, we expect to raise additional capital, both in the form of debt and new equity offerings during the next few years.

 However, there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us when needed or on terms which are acceptable. 
 Restricted Access to Banking and Other Financial Services 
 FinCEN issued the FinCEN Memorandum on February 14, 2014 with respect to financial institutions providing banking services to cannabis businesses. These include burdensome due diligence expectations and reporting requirements. The FinCEN Memorandum outlines the pathways for financial institutions to bank state-sanctioned cannabis businesses in compliance with federal enforcement priorities. The FinCEN Memorandum echoed the enforcement priorities of the Cole Memorandum and states that, in some circumstances, it is permissible for banks to provide services to cannabis-related businesses without risking prosecution for violation of federal money laundering laws. Under these guidelines, financial institutions must submit a Suspicious Activity Report in connection with all cannabis-related banking activities by any client of such financial institution, in accordance with federal money laundering laws. These cannabis-related Suspicious Activity Reports are divided into three categoriescannabis limited, cannabis priority, and cannabis terminatedbased on the financial institutions belief that the business in question follows state law, is operating outside of compliance with state law, or where the banking relationship has been terminated, respectively. 
 Former U.S. Attorney General Sessions revocation of the Cole Memorandum has not affected the status of the FinCEN Memorandum, nor has the Department of the Treasury given any indication that it intends to rescind the FinCEN Memorandum itself. Shortly after the Sessions Memorandum was issued, FinCEN did state that it would review the FinCEN Memorandum, but FinCEN has not yet issued further guidance. The FinCEN Memorandum is a standalone document which explicitly lists the eight enforcement priorities originally cited in the Cole Memorandum. As such, the FinCEN Memorandum remains intact, indicating that the Department of the Treasury and FinCEN intend to continue abiding by its guidance. 
 However, the FinCEN Memorandum does not provide any safe harbors or legal defenses from examination or regulatory or criminal enforcement actions by the Department of Justice, FinCEN or other federal regulators or for banks and other financial institutions. Thus, most banks and other financial institutions in the United States do not appear comfortable providing banking services to cannabis-related businesses or relying on this guidance, given that it has the potential to be amended or revoked by the current administration. In addition to the foregoing, banks and/or card networks may refuse to process debit card payments and credit card companies generally refuse to process credit card payments for cannabis-related businesses. As a result, we may have limited or no access to banking or other financial services in the United States. In addition, federal money laundering statutes and regulations under the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by Title III of the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the USA Patriot Act), discourage financial institutions from working with any organization that sells a controlled substance, regardless of whether the state it operates in permits cannabis sales. The inability or limitation on our ability to open or maintain bank accounts, obtain other banking services and/or accept credit card and debit card payments may make it difficult for us to operate and conduct our business as planned or to operate efficiently. 
 Federally-chartered banks and other depository institutions are currently hindered by federal law from providing financial services to marijuana businesses, even in states where those businesses are regulated. On March 7, 2019, Democratic representative Ed Perlmutter of Colorado introduced the SAFE Banking Act, which would protect banks and their employees from punishment for providing services to cannabis businesses that are legal on a state level. The bill was advanced by the House Financial Services Committee on March 28, 2019 and passed with strong bipartisan support in the House of Representatives on September 25, 2019. Some industry observers anticipate that the bill will be signed into law within the next year, which would, as noted above, allow financial institutions to provide services to marijuana related businesses without risk of violating federal money laundering statutes.

 Newly Established Legal Regime 
 Our business activities rely on newly established and/or developing laws and regulations in the states in which it operates. These laws and regulations are rapidly evolving and subject to change with minimal notice. Regulatory changes may adversely affect our profitability or cause us to cease operations entirely. The cannabis industry may come under further scrutiny by the Food and Drug Administration, the SEC, the Department of Justice, the Financial Industry Regulatory Advisory and other regulatory authorities that supervise or regulate the production, distribution, sale and use of cannabis for medical and nonmedical purposes in the United States. It is impossible to determine the extent of the impact of new laws, regulations or initiatives that may be proposed. The regulatory uncertainty surrounding the industry may adversely affect our business and operations, including without limitation, the costs to remain compliant with applicable laws and the impairment of our business or the ability to raise additional capital.
