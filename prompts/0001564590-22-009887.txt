 ITEM 1.BUSINESS 
 Corporate History
 Falcon (formerly named Osprey Energy Acquisition Corp.) was a blank check company, incorporated in Delaware in June 2016. The Company was formed for the purpose of acquiring, through a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, recapitalization, or other similar business transaction, one or more operating businesses or assets.
 On August 23, 2018 (the “Closing Date”), the Company completed the acquisition of the equity interests (the “Equity Interests”) in certain of the subsidiaries (the “Royal Entities”) of Noble Royalties Acquisition Co., LP (“NRAC”), Hooks Ranch Holdings LP (“Hooks Holdings”), DGK ORRI Holdings, LP (“DGK”), DGK ORRI GP LLC (“DGK GP”) and Hooks Holding Company GP, LLC (“Hooks GP”, and collectively with NRAC, Hooks Holdings, DGK, and DGK GP, the “Contributors”). The acquisition was made pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, dated as of June 3, 2018 (the “Contribution Agreement”), by and among the Company, Royal Resources L.P. (“Royal”), Royal Resources GP L.L.C. (“Royal GP”) and the Contributors. The acquisition of the Royal Entities pursuant to the Contribution Agreement is referred to as the “Business Combination” and the Business Combination together with the other transactions contemplated by the Contribution Agreement are referred to herein as the “deSPAC Transactions.”
 Pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, on the Closing Date, the Company contributed cash to Falcon Minerals Operating Partnership, LP, a Delaware limited partnership and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“OpCo”), in exchange for (a) a number of OpCo Common Units representing limited partnership interests in OpCo (the “OpCo Common Units”) equal to the number of shares of the Company’s Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Class A common stock”), outstanding as of the Closing Date and (b) a number of OpCo warrants exercisable for OpCo Common Units equal to the number of the Company’s warrants outstanding as of the Closing Date. The Company controls OpCo through Falcon Minerals GP, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and the sole general partner of OpCo .
 In connection with the Company’s entry into the Contribution Agreement, the Company agreed to issue and sell in a private placement an aggregate of 11,480,000 shares of Class A common stock for a purchase price of $10.00 per share, and aggregate consideration of $114.8 million (the “Private Placement”). The Private Placement was consummated concurrently with the deSPAC Transactions on the Closing Date and the proceeds of the Private Placement were used to fund a portion of the cash consideration paid to the Contributors.
 On the Closing Date, Falcon completed the acquisition of the Equity Interests and in return the Contributors received (i) $400 million of cash and (ii) 40 million OpCo Common Units. The Company also issued to the Contributors 40 million shares of non-economic Class C common stock of the Company, which entitles each holder to one vote per share. The OpCo Common Units are redeemable on a one-for-one basis for shares of Class A common stock at the option of the Contributors. Upon the redemption by any Contributor of OpCo Common Units for Class A common stock, a corresponding number of shares of Class C common stock held by such Contributor will be cancelled. 
 In connection with the closing of the Business Combination (the “Closing”), the Company changed its name from “Osprey Energy Acquisition Corp.” to “Falcon Minerals Corporation”. The Company is now structured as an “Up-C,” meaning that substantially all the assets of the Company are held by OpCo, and the Company’s only operating asset is its equity interest in OpCo. Each OpCo Common Unit, together with one share of Class C common stock, is exchangeable for one share of Class A common stock at the option of the holder pursuant to the terms of the Company’s and OpCo’s organizational documents, subject to certain restrictions.
 Our Business
 We were formed to own and acquire royalty interests, mineral interests, non-participating royalty interest and overriding royalty interests, or ORRIs (collectively, “Royalties”), in oil and natural gas properties in North America, substantially all of which are located in the Eagle Ford Shale. These Royalties entitle the holder to a portion of the production of oil and natural gas from the underlying acreage at the sales price received by the operator, net of any applicable post-production expenses and taxes. The holder of these interests has no obligation to fund exploration and development costs, lease operating expenses or plugging and abandonment costs at the end of a well’s productive life, which we believe results in low breakeven costs. As such, we have historically operated with high cash margins, converting a large percentage of revenue to free cash flow, the majority of which can be distributed to our shareholders. 
 As of December 31, 2021, our assets consisted of Royalties underlying approximately 256,000 gross unit acres (approximately 2,670 net royalty acres not normalized to 1/8th) that are concentrated in what we believe is the “core-of-the-core” of the liquids-rich condensate region of the Eagle Ford Shale in Karnes, DeWitt, and Gonzales Counties, Texas. In all three of these counties, we also have substantial exposure to the Austin Chalk and Upper Eagle Ford formations (this overlapping acreage is included in the 256,000 gross unit acres), which have experienced increased horizontal development activity, in addition to the more established and historically developed Lower Eagle Ford formation. We believe that the wells and remaining drilling locations on the properties underlying our assets are among the most economic in North America, with operator break-even oil prices under $35 per barrel. In addition, our assets include Royalties related to approximately 95,000 gross unit acres in the Appalachian region, including Pennsylvania, West Virginia, 
 4


and Ohio. Our acreage was extensively delineated by 2,827 producing wells as of December 3, 201, of which 2,328 are located in Karnes, DeWitt, and Gonzales Counties, providing extensive subsurface data control and substantial confidence on individual well initial production rates, production profiles and estimated ultimate recoveries (“EURs”). The average net daily production attributable to our net royalty interests was 4,438 BOE/d (47% oil) for the year ended December 3, 201.  This includes Eagle Ford production of 3,553 BOE/d (58% oil).  
 The Eagle Ford Shale is the one of the largest oil field in North America and is one of the lowest-cost and most active unconventional shale trends. It has a world-class aerial extent that covers approximately 13 million surface acres and has extensive data control as a result of more than 18,000 producing horizontal wells. The Eagle Ford has top-tier single-well economics, is operated by premier oil and gas companies, and has access to abundant offtake infrastructure in close proximity to the U.S. Gulf Coast. In recent years, the entire Eagle Ford Shale play has undergone a technical transformation largely driven by utilization of modern drilling and completion techniques, resulting in improved oil and gas sectional recoveries, enhanced production rates, EURs, well economics and increased activity by operators. Our acreage is located in what we believe is the “core-of-the-core” of the Eagle Ford Shale and is characterized by high oil and liquids content and low finding and development costs as well as positive differentials that drive attractive economics to operators relative to other unconventional basins. We believe these factors make the development of our underlying acreage commercially viable and highly attractive in lower commodity price environments. Approximately 89% of our Eagle Ford and Austin Chalk acreage is operated by ConocoPhillips (“ConocoPhillips”), EOG Resources, Inc. (“EOG”), and Devon Energy Corporation (“Devon”) through a joint venture. 
 Our revenues are primarily derived from royalty payments we receive from our operators based on the sale of oil and natural gas production, as well as the sale of natural gas liquids that are extracted from natural gas during processing. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our revenues were derived 69% from oil and condensate sales, 19% from natural gas sales, 10% from natural gas liquid sales and 2% from lease bonuses. For the year ended December 31, 2020 our revenues were derived 75% from oil and condensate sales, 18% from natural gas sales, and 7% from natural gas liquid sales. Our revenues may vary significantly from period to period as a result of changes in volumes of production sold or changes in commodity prices. Oil, natural gas and NGL prices have historically been volatile, and from time to time the Company may utilize commodity derivative instruments to mitigate the given price risk associated with its operations. 
 Our Properties
 Our assets consist of Royalties related to 559 drilling units, concentrated in what we believe is the “core-of-the-core” of the Eagle Ford Shale as well as the Marcellus Shale and Point Pleasant formations. As of December 31, 2021, these interests entitled us to receive an average royalty of 1.25% from the producing wells on the acreage underlying our Royalties, with no additional future capital or operating expenses required. As of December 31, 2021, there were 2,827 wells producing on this acreage, and average net production for the year ended December 31, 2021 was approximately 4,438 BOE/d. In addition, there were 81 horizontal wells in various stages of completion. As of December 31, 2021, there were 72 additional permits outstanding for undrilled wells or wells currently being drilled on the acreage underlying our Royalties. 
 Comparison of Types of Interests
 Mineral Interest. Mineral interests are perpetual real property rights of the owner to exploit, mine, and/or produce any or all of the minerals lying below the surface of the property. The holder of a mineral interest has the right to lease the minerals to a working interest holder pursuant to an oil and gas lease. 
 Royalty Interest. Royalty interests generally result when the owner of a mineral interest leases the underlying minerals to a working interest holder pursuant to an oil and gas lease. Typically, the resulting royalty interest is a cost-free percentage of production revenues for minerals extracted from the acreage. Holders of royalty interests are generally not responsible for capital expenditures or lease operating expenses, but may be responsible for certain post-production expenses, and typically have limited environmental liability. Royalty interests expire upon the expiration of the oil and gas lease. 
 Non-Participating Royalty Interest (“NPRI”). NPRI is an interest in oil and gas production that is created from the mineral estate.  The NPRI is expense-free, bearing no operational costs of production. The term “non-participating” indicates that the interest owner does not share in the bonus, rentals from a lease, nor the right to participate in the execution of oil and gas leases. 
 Overriding Royalty Interest (“ORRIs”). ORRIs are created by carving out the right to receive royalties from a working interest. Like royalty interests, ORRIs do not confer an obligation to make capital expenditures or pay for lease operating expenses and have limited environmental liability, however ORRIs may be calculated net of post-production expenses, depending on how the ORRI is structured. ORRIs that are carved out of working interests are linked to the same underlying oil and gas lease that created the working interest, and therefore, such ORRIs are typically subject to expiration upon the expiration or termination of the oil and gas lease.
 Working Interest. Working interest holders have the rights to extract minerals from acreage leased pursuant to an oil and gas lease from a mineral interest holder. Holders of working interests are responsible for their pro rata share of capital expenditures and lease operating expenses, but holders of working interests only receive revenues after distributions have first been made to holders of royalty interests and ORRIs. Working interests expire upon the termination or expiration of the underlying oil and gas lease.

Our Relationship with Royal Resources, L.P.
 Our largest shareholder is Royal, which was formed by a subsidiary of The Blackstone Group L.P. (“Blackstone”) in 2011. We were formed pursuant to the deSPAC Transactions through which Blackstone (through its ownership of Royal) has retained a significant ownership stake in us, representing approximately 41% of our voting interests through Royal’s ownership of our Class C common stock.  Pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, Blackstone also has the right to nominate six out of nine members of our Board of Directors. Falcon performs certain managerial operations for Royal with respect to assets that Royal owns that were not contributed to Falcon under a Master Services Agreement (“MSA”).  Under the MSA, Falcon is paid approximately $0.1 million per year, plus reimbursement of certain out of pocket expenses and an allocated amount of certain third-party costs.  See also, Part I, Item 1, Business, Corporate History.

Engineers and is proficient in judiciously applying industry standard practices to engineering evaluations as well as applying SEC and other industry reserves definitions and guidelines. RSC does not own an interest in us or any of our properties, nor is it employed by us on a contingent basis. A copy of RSC’s estimated proved reserve report as of December 31, 202 is incorporated by reference herein to Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report.
 Proved Reserves
 Evaluation and Review of Reserves
 Our historical reserve estimates as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 were prepared by RSC. A reserve audit is not the same as a financial audit and is less vigorous in nature than an independent reserve report where the independent reserve engineer determines the reserves on its own.
 Under SEC rules, proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible–from a given date forward, from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations–prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation. If deterministic methods are used, the SEC has defined reasonable certainty for proved reserves as a “high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered.” All of our proved reserves as of December 31, 2021 were estimated using a deterministic method. The estimation of reserves involves two distinct determinations. The first determination results in the estimation of the quantities of recoverable oil and gas and the second determination results in the estimation of the uncertainty associated with those estimated quantities in accordance with the definitions established under SEC rules. The process of estimating the quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves relies on the use of certain generally accepted analytical procedures. These analytical procedures fall into three broad categories or methods: (1) performance-based methods, (2) volumetric-based methods and (3) analogy. These methods may be used singularly or in combination by the reserve evaluator in the process of estimating the quantities of reserves. The proved reserves for our properties were estimated by performance methods, analogy, or a combination of both methods. Approximately 90% of the proved producing reserves attributable to producing wells were estimated by performance methods. These performance methods include, but may not be limited to, decline curve analysis, which utilized extrapolations of available historical production and pressure data. The remaining 10% of the proved producing reserves were estimated by analogy, or a combination of performance and analogy methods. The analogy method was used where there were inadequate historical performance data to establish a definitive trend and where the use of production performance data as a basis for the reserve estimates was considered to be inappropriate. All proved developed non-producing and undeveloped reserves were estimated by the analogy method.
 To estimate economically recoverable proved reserves and related future net cash flows, RSC considered many factors and assumptions, including the use of reservoir parameters derived from geological, geophysical, and engineering data which cannot be measured directly, economic criteria based on current costs and the SEC pricing requirements and forecasts of future production rates. To establish reasonable certainty with respect to our estimated proved reserves, the technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our proved reserves included production and well test data, downhole completion information, geologic data, electrical logs, radioactivity logs, core analyses, available seismic data and historical well cost and operating expense data.
 Our petroleum engineers work closely with our independent reserve engineers to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of the data used to calculate our proved reserves relating to our assets. Our internal technical team members met with our independent reserve engineers periodically during the period covered by the reserve report to discuss the assumptions and methods used in the proved reserve estimation process. We provide historical information to the independent reserve engineers for our properties such as ownership interest, oil, and gas production, well test data, commodity prices and operating and development costs. The Vice President–Reservoir Engineering is primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of all of our reserve estimates. The Vice President–Reservoir Engineering is a petroleum engineer with over 14 years of reservoir and operations experience. Our technical staff uses historical information for our properties such as ownership interest, oil, and gas production, well test data, commodity prices, and operating and development costs.
 The preparation of our proved reserve estimates are completed in accordance with our internal control procedures. These procedures, which are intended to ensure reliability of reserve estimations, include the following:
  
• | review and verification of historical production data, which data is based on actual production as reported by our operators;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | preparation of reserve estimates by the Vice President–Reservoir Engineering or under his direct supervision;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | review by the Vice President–Reservoir Engineering of all of our reported proved reserves at the close of each quarter, including the review of all significant reserve changes and all new proved undeveloped reserves additions;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | direct reporting responsibilities by the Vice President–Reservoir Engineering to the Chief Operating Officer;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | verification of property ownership by our land department; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | no employee’s compensation is tied to the amount of reserves booked.

(1) | Estimates of reserves as of December 31, 2021 were prepared using an average price equal to the unweighted arithmetic average of hydrocarbon prices received on a field-by-field basis on the first day of each month within the year ended December 31, 2021 in accordance with revised SEC rules and regulations applicable to reserve estimates as of the end of such period. The unweighted arithmetic average first day of the month prices were $66.56 per Bbl for oil and $3.60 per Mcf for natural gas at December 31, 2021. The unweighted arithmetic average first day of the month prices were $39.57 per Bbl for oil and $1.99 per Mcf for natural gas at December 31, 2020. The price per Bbl for natural gas liquids was modeled as a percentage of oil price, which was derived from historical accounting data. Reserve estimates do not include any value for probable or possible reserves that may exist, nor do they include any value for undeveloped acreage. The reserve estimates represent Royalties in our properties. Although we believe these estimates are reasonable, actual future production, cash flows, taxes, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves may vary substantially from these estimates.

(2) | In this Annual Report, we have disclosed our PV-10 based on our reserve report. PV-10 represents the period end present value of estimated future cash inflows from our natural gas and crude oil reserves, less production costs, discounted at 10% per annum to reflect timing of future cash flows and using SEC pricing requirements in effect at the end of the period. Because of this, PV-10 can be used within the industry and by creditors and securities analysts to evaluate estimated net cash flows from proved reserves on a more comparable basis. PV-10 differs from standardized measure because it does not include the effects of income taxes. Neither PV-10 nor standardized measure represents an estimate of fair market value of our natural gas and oil properties. We and others in the industry use PV-10 as a measure to compare the relative size and value of estimated reserves held by companies without regard to the specific tax characteristics of such entities.

 As of December 31, 2021, our historical proved developed reserves totaled 2,738 MBbls of oil, 19,098 MMcf of natural gas and 1,183 MBbls of natural gas liquids, for a total of 7,104 MBOE. Of the total proved developed reserves, 99% are producing and the remaining 1% are from wells that have been stimulated but are not yet producing hydrocarbons. 
 The foregoing reserves are all located within the continental United States. Reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating volumes of economically recoverable oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation. As a result, the estimates of different engineers often vary. In addition, the results of drilling, testing and production may justify revisions of such estimates. Accordingly, reserve estimates often differ from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered. Estimates of economically recoverable oil and natural gas and of future net revenues are based on a number of variables and assumptions, all of which may vary from actual results, including geologic interpretation, prices, and future production rates and costs. See “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report. We have not filed any estimates of total, proved net oil or natural gas reserves with any federal authority or agency other than the SEC.

Proved Undeveloped Reserves
 As of December 31, 2021, our historical proved undeveloped reserves totaled 5,025 MBbls of oil, 24,339 MMcf of natural gas and 1,059 MBbls of natural gas liquids, for a total of 10,141 MBOE. PUD reserves will be converted from undeveloped to developed as the applicable wells begin production.
 During the year ended December 31, 2021, our PUD reserves changed due to:
  
• | the conversion of 628 MBOE of PUD reserves into PDP and PNP reserves;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | net negative revisions of 1,569 MBOE as a result of the removal of certain locations to the drilling schedule as part of a revised development plan;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | positive revisions of 34 MBOE as a result of higher commodity prices and type curve changes; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | positive revisions of 33 MBOE as a result of acquisitions.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------

 In accordance with rules and regulations of the SEC applicable to companies involved in oil and natural gas producing activities, all of our PUD drilling locations are scheduled to be drilled prior to the end of December 2026. This development schedule is based on an 81 well inventory waiting to be brought online, 72 permits that identify activity and continued PUD conversion based on historical drilling activity and the publicly announced capital expenditure plans of our operators. As an owner of Royalties and not working interests, we are not required to make capital expenditures and did not make capital expenditures to convert PUD reserves from undeveloped to developed.
 Identification of Drilling Locations
 Our identification of drilling locations is based on specifically identified locations on our leasehold acreage based on our assessment of current geoscientific, engineering, land, well-spacing and historic production profile information derived from state agencies and public statements by our operators on the acreage underlying our interests. These drilling locations are identified on a detailed map and allocated a reserve profile and identifier. Further, RSC reviewed and confirmed our drilling locations in estimating our PUD reserves in connection with the preparation of our reserve report as of December 31, 2021. We update and revise our drilling locations on a periodic basis as our assessment of the information described above changes.
Production and Price History
 The following table sets forth information regarding our net production of oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids, substantially all of which is from the Eagle Ford Shale region in South Texas, and certain price and cost information for each of the periods indicated:

Competition
 The oil and natural gas business is highly competitive in the exploration for and acquisition of reserves, the acquisition of minerals and oil and natural gas leases, and personnel required to find and produce reserves. Many companies not only explore for and produce oil and natural gas, but also conduct midstream and refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional, national, or worldwide basis. Certain of our competitors may possess financial or other resources substantially larger than we possess. Our ability to acquire additional minerals and properties and to discover reserves in the future will be dependent upon our ability to identify and evaluate suitable acquisition prospects and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. Oil and natural gas products compete with other sources of energy available to customers, primarily based on price. These alternate sources of energy include coal, nuclear, solar, and wind. Changes in the availability or price of oil and natural gas or other sources of energy, as well as business conditions, conservation, legislation, regulations, and the ability to convert to alternate fuels and other sources of energy may affect the aggregate demand for oil and natural gas over time. 
Seasonal Nature of Business
 Generally, demand for oil increases during the summer months and decreases during the winter months while natural gas decreases during the summer months and increases during the winter months. Certain natural gas users utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer, which can lessen seasonal demand fluctuations. Seasonal weather conditions and lease stipulations can limit drilling and producing activities and other oil and natural gas operations in a portion of our operating areas. These seasonal anomalies can pose challenges for our operators in meeting well drilling objectives and can increase competition for equipment, supplies and personnel during the spring and summer months, which could lead to shortages and increase costs or delay operations.
Regulation
 The following disclosure describes regulation more directly associated with operators of oil and natural gas properties, including our current operators, and other owners of working interests in oil and natural gas properties. To the extent we elect in the future to engage in the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas properties, we would be directly subject to the same regulations described below. 
 Oil and natural gas operations are subject to various types of legislation, regulation and other legal requirements enacted by governmental authorities. This legislation and regulation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion. Some of these requirements carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. The regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases the cost of doing business.
 Environmental Matters
 Oil and natural gas exploration, development and production operations are subject to stringent laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to protection of the environment or occupational health and safety. Numerous federal, state, and local governmental agencies, such as the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), issue regulations that often require difficult and costly compliance measures that carry substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties and may result in injunctive obligations for non-compliance. These laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before drilling 
 11


commences, restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities, limit or prohibit construction or drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, ecologically sensitive and other protected areas, require action to prevent or remediate pollution from current or former operations, such as plugging abandoned wells or closing earthen pits, result in the suspension or revocation of necessary permits, licenses and authorizations, require that additional pollution controls be installed and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from operations. The strict and joint and several liability nature of such laws and regulations could impose liability upon responsible parties (including the operators of the acreage underlying our Royalties) regardless of fault. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances, hydrocarbons, or other waste products into the environment. Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent and costly pollution control or waste handling, storage, transport, disposal, or cleanup requirements could materially adversely affect Falcon’s business and prospects.
 Waste Handling
 The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended (“RCRA”), and comparable state statutes and regulations promulgated thereunder, affect oil and natural gas exploration, development, and production activities by imposing requirements regarding the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal, and cleanup of hazardous and non- hazardous wastes. With federal approval, the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. Although most wastes associated with the exploration, development, and production of oil and natural gas are exempt from regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA, these wastes typically constitute “solid wastes” that are subject to less stringent non-hazardous waste requirements. However, it is possible that RCRA could be amended or the EPA or state environmental agencies could adopt policies to require oil and natural gas exploration, development, and production wastes to become subject to more stringent waste handling requirements. Any changes in the laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operators’ capital expenditures and operating expenses, which in turn could affect production from our properties and adversely affect our business and prospects.
Remediation of Hazardous Substances
 The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended (“CERCLA”), also known as the “Superfund” law, and analogous state laws, generally impose strict and joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of the original conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include the current owner or operator of a contaminated facility, a former owner or operator of the facility at the time of contamination, and those persons that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substance at the facility. Under CERCLA and comparable state statutes, persons deemed “responsible parties” may be subject to strict and joint and several liability for the costs of removing or remediating previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators) or property contamination (including groundwater contamination), for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. In addition, the risk of accidental spills or releases could expose the operators of the acreage underlying Falcon’s Royalties to significant liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on the operators’ businesses, financial condition, and results of operations. Liability for any contamination under these laws could require the operators of the acreage underlying Falcon’s Royalties to make significant expenditures to investigate and remediate such contamination or attain and maintain compliance with such laws and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on their results of operations, competitive position, or financial condition.
Water Discharges
  The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, also known as the “Clean Water Act” (“CWA”), the Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”), the Oil Pollution Act (“OPA”), and analogous state laws and regulations promulgated thereunder impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the unauthorized discharge of pollutants, including produced waters and other gas and oil wastes, into navigable waters of the United States, as well as state waters. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or the state. The CWA and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit the discharge of dredge and fill material into regulated waters, including jurisdictional wetlands, unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit. In June 2015, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the “Corps”) published a final rule attempting to clarify the federal jurisdictional reach over waters of the United States (“WOTUS”). Following the change in U.S. Presidential Administrations, there have been several attempts to modify or eliminate this rule. In January 2020, the EPA and Corps replaced the WOTUS rule adopted in 2015 with the narrower Navigable Waters Protection Rule, and litigation ensued. In August 2021, a federal judge in the District of Arizona struck down the Navigable Waters Protection Rule. Soon after, the Biden administration and the Corps announced that they have stopped enforcing the Navigable Waters Protection Rule nationwide and that they are reverting back to the 1986 WOTUS definition. In November 2021, the EPA and Corps issued prepublication notice of a proposed rule to revise the definition of “waters of the United States” to put back into place the pre-2015 definition, updated to reflect consideration of Supreme Court decisions, including the Supreme Court’s April 2020 decision holding that, in certain cases, discharges from a point source to groundwater could fall within the scope of the CWA and require a permit. In January 2022, the Supreme Court agreed to hear a case regarding the jurisdictional reach of 
 12


WOTUS.  Therefore, the scope of jurisdiction under the CWA is uncertain at this time, and any increase in scope could result in increased costs or delays with respect to obtaining permits for certain activities for our operators. In addition, spill prevention, control, and countermeasure plan requirements under federal law require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture, or leak. The EPA has also adopted regulations requiring certain oil and natural gas exploration and production facilities to obtain individual permits or coverage under general permits for storm water discharges. 
 The OPA is the primary federal law for oil spill liability. The OPA contains numerous requirements relating to the prevention of and response to petroleum releases into waters of the United States, including the requirement that operators of offshore facilities and certain onshore facilities near or crossing waterways must develop and maintain facility response contingency plans and maintain certain significant levels of financial assurance to cover potential environmental cleanup and restoration costs. The OPA subjects owners of facilities to strict, joint, and several liability for all containment and cleanup costs and certain other damages arising from a release, including, but not limited to, the costs of responding to a release of oil into surface waters.
 In addition, the SDWA grants the EPA broad authority to take action to protect public health when an underground source of drinking water is threatened with pollution that presents an imminent and substantial endangerment to humans, which could result in orders prohibiting or limiting the operations of oil and natural gas production facilities. The EPA has asserted regulatory authority pursuant to the SDWA’s Underground Injection Control (“UIC”) program over hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuel in fracturing fluids and issued guidance covering such activities. The SDWA also regulates saltwater disposal wells under the UIC Program. Recent concerns related to the operation of saltwater disposal wells and induced seismicity have led some states to impose limits on the total volume of produced water such wells can dispose of, order disposal wells to cease operations, or limit the construction of new wells. For example, the Railroad Commission of Texas (the “TRRC”) recently issued a notice to operators in the Midland area to reduce daily injection volumes following multiple earthquakes above a 3.5 magnitude over an 18-month period. The notice also required disposal well operators to provide injection data to TRRC staff to further analyze seismicity in the area. These seismic events have also resulted in environmental groups and local residents filing lawsuits against operators in areas where the events occur seeking damages and injunctions limiting or prohibiting saltwater disposal well construction activities and operations. A lack of saltwater disposal wells in production areas could result in increased disposal costs for our operators if they are forced to transport produced water by truck, pipeline, or other method over long distances, or force them to curtail operations.
 Noncompliance with the Clean Water Act, SDWA, or the OPA may result in substantial administrative, civil, and criminal penalties, as well as injunctive obligations, all of which could affect production from our properties and adversely affect our business and prospects.
 Air Emissions
 The federal Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and comparable state laws and regulations regulate emissions of various air pollutants through the issuance of permits and the imposition of other requirements. The EPA has developed, and continues to develop, stringent regulations governing emissions of air pollutants at specified sources. New facilities may be required to obtain permits before work can begin, and existing facilities may be required to obtain additional permits and incur capital costs in order to remain in compliance. For example, in October 2015, the EPA lowered the National Ambient Air Quality Standard, (“NAAQS”) for ozone from 75 to 70 parts per billion for both the 8-hour primary and secondary standards, and the agency completed attainment/non-attainment designations in July 2018. State implementation of the revised NAAQS could result in stricter permitting requirements, delay, or prohibit the ability of our operators to obtain such permits, and result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment, the costs of which could be significant. Separately, in June 2016, the EPA finalized rules regarding criteria for aggregating multiple small surface sites into a single source for air-quality permitting purposes applicable to the oil and natural gas industry. This rule could cause small facilities, on an aggregate basis, to be deemed a major source, thereby triggering more stringent air permitting processes and requirements. These laws and regulations may increase the costs of compliance for oil and natural gas producers and impact production on our properties, and federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil, and criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the federal Clean Air Act and associated state laws and regulations. Moreover, obtaining or renewing permits has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas exploration and development projects. All of these factors could impact production on our properties and adversely affect our business and results of operations.
Climate Change
 The threat of climate change continues to attract considerable attention in the United States and in foreign countries, numerous proposals have been made and could continue to be made at the international, national, regional, and state levels of government to monitor and limit existing emissions of greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) as well as to restrict or eliminate such future emissions. As a result, our operations as well as the operations of our operators are subject to a series of regulatory, political, litigation, and financial risks associated with the production and processing of fossil fuels and emission of GHGs.
 In the United States, no comprehensive climate change legislation has been implemented at the federal level. However, the current administration has highlighted addressing climate change as a priority and has issued several executive orders addressing climate change, including one that calls for substantial action on climate change, such as the increased use of zero-emission vehicles by the federal government, the elimination of subsidies provided to the fossil fuel industry, and increased emphasis on climate-related risks across 
 13


government agencies and economic sectors. Moreover, following the U.S. Supreme Court finding that GHG emissions constitute a pollutant under the CAA, the EPA has adopted regulations that, among other things, establish construction and operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources and require the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain petroleum and natural gas system sources in the United States. The regulation of methane from oil and gas facilities has been subject to uncertainty in recent years. The current administration has also issued an executive order calling for the suspension, revision, or rescission, of a September 2020 rule rescinding certain methane standards and removing transmission and storage segments from the source category for certain regulations, and the reinstatement or issuance of methane emissions standards for new, modified, and existing oil and gas facilities. In response, the U.S. Congress has approved, and President Biden has signed into law, a resolution under the Congressional Review Act to repeal the September 2020 revisions to the methane standards, effectively reinstating the prior standards. In November 2021, as required by President Biden’s executive order, the EPA proposed new regulations to establish comprehensive standards of performance and emission guidelines for methane and volatile organic compound emissions from new and existing operations in the oil and gas sector, including the exploration and production, transmission, processing, and storage segments. The EPA hopes to finalize such standards by the end of 2022.
 Additionally, various states and groups of states have adopted or are considering adopting legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that are focused on such areas GHG cap and trade programs, carbon taxes, reporting and tracking programs, and restriction of emissions. At the international level, the United Nations-sponsored “Paris Agreement,” requires member states to submit non-binding, individually determined reduction goals every five years after 2020. Although the United States had withdrawn from the Paris Agreement, President Biden has recommitted the United States and, in April 2021, announced a goal of reducing the United States’ emissions by 50-52% below 2005 levels by 2030. In November 2021, the international community gathered again in Glasgow at the 26th Conference to the Parties on the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (“COP26”), during which multiple announcements were made, including a call for parties to eliminate certain fossil fuel subsidies and pursue further action on non-carbon dioxide GHGs. Relatedly, the United States and European Union jointly announced the launch of the “Global Methane Pledge,” which aims to cut global methane pollution at least 30% by 2030 relative to 2020 levels, including “all feasible reductions” in the energy sector. Governmental, scientific, and public concern over the threat of climate change arising from GHG emissions has resulted in increasing political risks in the United States, including climate-change-related pledges made by some candidates now in political office. These have included promises to limit emissions and curtail certain production of oil and natural gas. The current administration’s January 2021 climate change executive order directed the Secretary of the Interior to pause new oil and natural gas leasing on public lands and in offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive review of the federal permitting and leasing practices. A federal district court judge in Louisiana issued a nationwide preliminary injunction in June 2021, effectively preventing the Biden administration from implementing the pause of new oil and natural gas leases on federal lands and waters and forcing the lease sale.  In November 2021, the U.S. Department of the Interior released its “Report On The Federal Oil And Gas Leasing Program,” which assessed the current state of oil and gas leasing on federal lands and proposed several reforms, including raising royalty rates and implementing stricter standards for entities seeking to purchase oil and gas leases. Recently, in January 2022, a federal district court judge in Washington, DC vacated the results of the federal government’s Lease Sale 257, effectively canceling the sale, on the grounds that the federal government failed to consider foreign consumption of oil and natural gas from its greenhouse gas emissions analysis.  In February 2022, a federal district court judge in Louisiana blocked the Biden Administration’s method of calculating the social costs associated with greenhouse gases, and specifically blocked federal agencies from considering the findings from the White House Interagency Working Group, which had been tasked with devising new metrics based on the Obama-era calculations.  In response, also in February 2022, the Biden administration asked the court to stay the injunction and announced that it would be suspending or delaying new federal oil and gas leases.  These recent developments and the Biden administration’s and certain federal courts’ focus on the climate change impacts of federal projects could result in significant changes to the federal oil and gas leasing program in the future.  Restrictions surrounding onshore drilling, onshore federal lease availability, and restrictions on the ability to obtain required permits, could have a material adverse impact on our operators and, in turn, our operations.
Other actions that could be pursued by the current administration may include the imposition of more restrictive requirements for the establishment of pipeline infrastructure or the permitting of LNG export facilities, as well as more restrictive GHG emission limitations for oil and gas facilities. Litigation risks are also increasing as a number of cities and other local governments have sought to bring suit against the largest oil and natural gas companies in state or federal court, alleging among other things, that such companies created public nuisances by producing fuels that contributed to climate change or alleging that the companies have been aware of the adverse effects of climate change for some time but failed to adequately disclose such impacts to their investors or customers.
 There are also increasing financial risks for fossil fuel producers as shareholders currently invested in fossil-fuel energy companies may elect in the future to shift some or all of their investments into non-energy related sectors. Institutional lenders who provide financing to fossil-fuel energy companies also have become more attentive to sustainable lending practices and some of them may elect not to provide funding for fossil fuel energy companies. Additionally, financial institutions may be required to adopt policies that have the effect of reducing the funding provided to the fossil fuel sector. The Federal Reserve recently joined the Network for Greening the Financial System, a consortium of financial regulators focused on addressing climate-related risks in the financial sector.
 Limitation of investments in and financing for fossil fuel energy companies could result in the restriction, delay, or cancellation of drilling programs or development or production activities.
 14


The adoption and implementation of new or more stringent international, federal, or state legislation, regulations, or other regulatory initiatives that impose more stringent standards for GHG emissions from the oil and natural gas sector or otherwise restrict the areas in which this sector may produce oil and natural gas or generate the GHG emissions could result in increased costs of compliance or costs of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for oil and natural gas, which could reduce the profitability of our interests. Additionally, political, litigation, and financial risks may result in our oil and natural gas operators restricting or cancelling production activities, incurring liability for infrastructure damages as a result of climatic changes, or impairing their ability to continue to operate in an economic manner, which also could reduce the profitability of our interests. One or more of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operation.
 Regulation of Hydraulic Fracturing
 Our operators engage in hydraulic fracturing, a common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons from tight formations, including shales. The process involves the injection of water, sand, and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. The process is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions, but recently the EPA and other federal agencies have asserted jurisdiction over certain aspects of hydraulic fracturing. For example, the EPA issued effluent limitation guidelines in June 2016 that prohibit the discharge of wastewater from hydraulic fracturing operations to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants.
 In December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. The final report concluded that “water cycle” activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under certain limited circumstances. The EPA has not proposed to take any action in response to the report’s findings.
 Several states where we own interests in oil and gas producing properties, have adopted regulations that could restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances or require the disclosure of the composition of hydraulic-fracturing fluids. For example, Texas has imposed certain limits on the permitting or operation of disposal wells in areas with increased instances of induced seismic events. Recently, the TRRC issued a notice to operators in the Midland area to reduce daily injection volumes following multiple earthquakes above a 3.5 magnitude over an 18-month period. The notice also required disposal well operators to provide injection data to TRRC staff to further analyze seismicity in the area. These existing or any new legal requirements establishing seismic permitting requirements or similar restrictions on the construction or operation of disposal wells for the injection of produced water likely will result in added costs to comply and affect our operators’ rate of production, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. In addition to state laws, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, may restrict or prohibit the performance of well drilling in general or hydraulic fracturing in particular. 
 We cannot predict what additional state or local requirements may be imposed in the future on oil and gas operations in the states in which we own interests. In the event state, local, or municipal legal restrictions are adopted in areas where our operators conduct operations, our operators may incur substantial costs to comply with these requirements, which may be significant in nature, experience delays, or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities and perhaps even be precluded from the drilling of wells.
 There has been increasing public controversy regarding hydraulic fracturing with regard to increased risks of induced seismicity, the use of fracturing fluids, impacts on drinking water supplies, use of water, and the potential for impacts to surface water, groundwater, and the environment generally. A number of lawsuits and enforcement actions have been initiated across the country implicating hydraulic-fracturing practices. If new laws or regulations are adopted that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing, those laws could make it more difficult or costly for our operators to perform fracturing to stimulate production from tight formations. In addition, if hydraulic fracturing is further regulated at the federal or state level, fracturing activities on our properties could become subject to additional permitting and financial assurance requirements, more stringent construction specifications, increased monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping obligations, plugging and abandonment requirements, and also to attendant permitting delays and potential increases in costs. Legislative changes could cause operators to incur substantial compliance costs. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the impact on our business of newly enacted or potential federal or state legislation governing hydraulic fracturing.
 Endangered Species Act
 Some of the operations on acreage underlying our Royalties may be located in areas that are designated as habitats for endangered or threatened species under the Endangered Species Act. In February 2016, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service published a final policy that alters how it identifies critical habitat for endangered and threatened species. However, the Biden administration published two rules in October 2021 that reversed changes made by the Trump administration, namely to the definition of “habitat” and to a policy that made it easier to exclude territory from critical habitat. A critical habitat designation could result in further material restrictions to federal and private land use and could delay or prohibit land access or development. Moreover, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service continues to make listing decisions and critical habitat designations where necessary, including for over 250 species as required under a 2011 settlement approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, and many hundreds of additional anticipated listing decisions have already been identified beyond those recognized in the 2011 settlement. The designation of previously unprotected species as being endangered or threatened, if located in the areas where we have Royalties, could cause the operators of the operations 
 15


on the acreage underlying our Royalties to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions in areas where the species are known to exist.
 Other Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry
 The oil and natural gas industry is extensively regulated by numerous federal, state and local authorities. Legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion, frequently increasing the regulatory burden. Also, numerous departments and agencies, both federal and state, are authorized by statute to issue rules and regulations that are binding on the oil and natural gas industry and its individual members, some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. Although the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases the cost of doing business, these burdens generally do not affect the Company any differently or to any greater or lesser extent than they affect other companies in the industry with similar types, quantities, and locations of production.
 The availability, terms and cost of transportation significantly affect sales of oil and natural gas. The interstate transportation and sale for resale of oil and natural gas is subject to federal regulation, including regulation of the terms, conditions and rates for interstate transportation, storage, and various other matters, primarily by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”). Federal and state regulations govern the price and terms for access to oil and natural gas pipeline transportation. FERC’s regulations for interstate oil and natural gas transmission in some circumstances may also affect the intrastate transportation of oil and natural gas.
 Although oil and natural gas prices are currently unregulated, Congress historically has been active in the area of oil and natural gas regulation. The Company cannot predict whether new legislation to regulate oil and natural gas might be proposed, what proposals, if any, might actually be enacted by Congress or the various state legislatures, and what effect, if any, the proposals might have on Falcon’s operations. Sales of condensate and oil and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at market prices.
 Drilling and Production
 The operations of the Company’s operators are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state, and local level. These types of regulation include requiring permits for the drilling of wells, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations. The state, and some counties and municipalities, in which the Company operates also regulate one or more of the following: 

• | the location of wells;
--+-----------------------


• | the method of drilling and casing wells;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | the timing of construction or drilling activities, including seasonal wildlife closures;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the rates of production or “allowables”;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the plugging and abandoning of wells; and
--+------------------------------------------


• | notice to, and consultation with, surface owners and other third parties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 State laws regulate the size and shape of drilling and spacing units or proration units governing the pooling of oil and natural gas properties. Some states allow forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases. In some instances, forced pooling or unitization may be implemented by third parties and may reduce the Company’s interest in the unitized properties. In addition, state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells, generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose requirements regarding the ratability of production. These laws and regulations may limit the amount of oil and natural gas that the Company’s operators can produce from our wells or limit the number of wells or the locations at which operators can drill. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids within its jurisdiction. States do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct regulation, but we cannot assure you that they will not do so in the future. The effect of such future regulations may be to limit the amounts of oil and natural gas that may be produced from our wells, negatively affect the economics of production from these wells or to limit the number of locations operators can drill.
 Federal, state, and local regulations provide detailed requirements for the abandonment of wells, closure or decommissioning of production facilities and pipelines and for site restoration in areas where the operators of the acreage underlying our Royalties operate. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and many other state and local authorities also have regulations for plugging and abandonment, decommissioning and site restoration. Although the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers does not require bonds or other financial assurances, some state agencies and municipalities do have such requirements.
 Natural Gas Sales and Transportation
 Historically, federal legislation and regulatory controls have affected the price and marketing of natural gas. FERC has jurisdiction over the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce by natural gas companies under the Natural Gas Act of

1938 (“NGA”) and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. Since 1978, various federal laws have been enacted which have resulted in the complete removal of all price and non-price controls for sales of domestic natural gas sold in “first sales.” Under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, FERC has substantial enforcement authority to prohibit the manipulation of natural gas markets and enforce its rules and orders, including the ability to assess substantial civil penalties.
 FERC also regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates and service conditions and establishes the terms under which our operators may use interstate natural gas pipeline capacity, which affects the marketing of natural gas that our operators produce, as well as the revenues our operators receive for sales of natural gas and release of natural gas pipeline capacity. Commencing in 1985, FERC promulgated a series of orders, regulations and rule makings that significantly fostered competition in the business of transporting and marketing gas. Today, interstate pipeline companies are required to provide nondiscriminatory transportation services to producers, marketers, and other shippers, regardless of whether such shippers are affiliated with an interstate pipeline company. FERC’s initiatives have led to the development of a competitive, open access market for natural gas purchases and sales that permits all purchasers of natural gas to buy gas directly from third-party sellers other than pipelines. However, the natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated; therefore, we cannot guarantee that the less stringent regulatory approach currently pursued by FERC and Congress will continue indefinitely into the future nor can we determine what effect, if any, future regulatory changes might have on our natural gas-related activities.
 Under FERC’s current regulatory regime, transmission services must be provided on an open-access, nondiscriminatory basis at cost-based rates or at market-based rates if the transportation market at issue is sufficiently competitive. Gathering service, which occurs upstream of jurisdictional transmission services, is regulated by the states onshore and in-state waters. Section 1(b) of the NGA exempts natural gas gathering facilities from regulation by FERC as a natural gas company under the NGA. Although its policy is still in flux, FERC has in the past reclassified certain jurisdictional transmission facilities as non-jurisdictional gathering facilities, which has the tendency to increase our operators’ costs of transporting gas to point-of-sale locations.
 Oil Sales and Transportation
 Sales of crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at negotiated prices. Nevertheless, Congress could reenact price controls in the future.
 Crude oil sales are affected by the availability, terms, and cost of transportation. The transportation of oil in common carrier pipelines is also subject to rate regulation. FERC regulates interstate oil pipeline transportation rates under the Interstate Commerce Act and intrastate oil pipeline transportation rates are subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions. The basis for intrastate oil pipeline regulation, and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate oil pipeline rates, varies from state to state. Insofar as effective interstate and intrastate rates are equally applicable to all comparable shippers, we believe that the regulation of oil transportation rates will not affect our operations in any materially different way than such regulation will affect the operations of our competitors.
 Further, interstate, and intrastate common carrier oil pipelines must provide service on a non-discriminatory basis. Under this open access standard, common carriers must offer service to all shippers requesting service on the same terms and under the same rates. When oil pipelines operate at full capacity, access is governed by portioning provisions set forth in the pipelines’ published tariffs. Accordingly, we believe that access to oil pipeline transportation services generally will be available to our operators to the same extent as to the Company or their competitors.
 State Regulation
 Texas regulates the drilling for, and the production, gathering and sale of, oil and natural gas, including imposing severance taxes and requirements for obtaining drilling permits. Texas currently imposes a 4.6% severance tax on the market value of oil production and a 7.5% severance tax on the market value of natural gas production. States also regulate the method of developing new fields, the spacing and operation of wells and the prevention of waste of oil and natural gas resources. States may regulate rates of production and may establish maximum daily production allowables from oil and natural gas wells based on market demand or resource conservation, or both. States do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct economic regulation, but we cannot assure you that they will not do so in the future. The effect of these regulations may be to limit the amount of oil and natural gas that may be produced from our wells and to limit the number of wells or locations our operators can drill.
 The petroleum industry is also subject to compliance with various other federal, state, and local regulations and laws. Some of those laws relate to resource conservation and equal employment opportunity. We do not believe that compliance with these laws will have a material adverse effect on us.
 Human Capital
 Overview and Structure. We consider our workforce to be our most important asset, and we have sought to structure our hiring practices, compensation and benefits programs, and employee practices to attract and retain high-quality personnel and to provide a comfortable and collegial work environment. We continue to invest in our employees by providing training opportunities, promoting

diversity and inclusion, and maintaining focus on corporate ethics. We are managed and operated by the executive officers of our Company and our Board of Directors oversees the management of the Company. 
 Headcount. We rely principally on full-time employees but use independent contractors as needed to assist with special projects. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had 11 full-time employees and one contractor. None of Falcon’s employees are represented by labor unions or covered by any collective bargaining agreements.
 Recruiting. As a small, tight-knit community, our employees have broad responsibilities, and we encourage continuing development in their careers. When new opportunities arise within our organization, we may look within our organization for talent to fill those needs, ask for referrals from our team (who understand the diverse skill sets, high energy and forward-thinking attitude that contributes to delivering exceptional results), or work with recruiters who specialize in the areas of our vacancies.
 Compensation. As part of our efforts to hire and retain highly qualified employees, we have structured compensation and benefits programs that, we believe, are extremely competitive and reward outstanding performance. In addition to the incentive programs in place for our named executive officers, which are described in detail in our proxy statement, we have structured an incentive bonus program for non-officer employees that is dependent on an employee’s individual performance and our performance as a company. Our employees also receive restricted-share and performance-unit awards to encourage retention and align compensation with our company performance.
 Healthcare and Other Benefits. We provide a robust suite of benefits to our employees covering all aspects of life, including 401(k) matching, medical-insurance options, and programs to encourage and support the whole person, including physical, mental and emotional, financial, social, career, and community service initiatives.
Facilities
 Our executive offices are located at 609 Main Street, Suite 3950, Houston, TX 77002.   We have additional leased office space in New York, NY and Philadelphia, PA. Our Philadelphia, PA office is shared with Hepco Capital Management, LLC (“Hepco”), which Company executive Jeffrey Brotman is also a director and officer of.  The related cost of our shared office is proportionately shared between the Company and Hepco.  We believe that these facilities are adequate for our current operations.
