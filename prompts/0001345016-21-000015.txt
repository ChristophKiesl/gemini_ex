Item 1. Business.
Company Overview
Since Yelp's founding 16 years ago, our mission has remained the same — to connect consumers with great local businesses. Over that time, we have built one of the best known internet brands in the United States. Consumers trust us for our more than 200 million ratings and reviews of businesses across a broad range of categories. This consumer trust is the foundation of our business, from which we are able to empower other businesses to succeed. Our advertising products help businesses of all sizes reach a large audience, advertise their products and drive conversion of their services. We believe our ability to provide value to both consumers and businesses positions us well in the local, digital advertising market in the United States. 
In 2019, we announced an ambitious, multi-year business transformation plan designed to drive and sustain long-term profitable growth. The strategy underlying this plan aimed to increase our value proposition to businesses while also driving growth through the combination of product innovation, marketing and our multi-location business rather than local sales headcount. We executed against this strategy by increasing our pace of product innovation, expanding our customer base among multi-location businesses and aligning how we sell our services with advertiser success. We also increased our operating discipline and rationalized our cost structure.
Delivering Product Innovation
•Building increasingly differentiated category experiences for our Services categories — home, local, auto, professional, pets, events, real estate and financial services — which increased the value of leads delivered to Services businesses as well as improved the product experience for both advertisers and consumers. 
Targeting Multi-location Businesses
•Expanding our National, Mid-Market and Franchise (“Multi-location”) business, which increased our market opportunity and contributed higher-margin revenue than our Local sales business.
Aligning Our Business Model with Advertiser Success
•Completing our transition to the exclusive sale of non-term contracts for our single-location, small and medium-sized business (“SMB”) customers, which allow them to start, upgrade, cancel or restart their advertising programs at any time.
•Enabling customers to purchase and more fully manage their advertising on a self-serve basis, which improved customer retention and reduced our reliance on sales and customer support headcount.
Optimizing Our Cost Structure
•Substantially reducing our Local sales team, including by more than 50% in April 2020, a process made possible by our investments in product development and significantly accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. We were also able to increase the Local sales team's productivity through this process by retaining our most tenured and successful sales representatives and optimizing their compensation structure.
•Shifting our employee base to lower-cost markets by moving many of our general and administrative roles from San Francisco to the Phoenix area and growing our product development team primarily in Canada, Germany and the United Kingdom. 
Our Long-term Growth Opportunity is Large
We believe we are well positioned in the large and growing local, digital advertising market. Together with the improvements from our business transformation, the competitive advantages we have established over the past 16 years provide us with the opportunity for consistent, long-term growth in this market:
•We have a strong brand and a large consumer audience. Our large audience of engaged consumers reflects the strength of our brand as well as our availability across a wide range of platforms and devices. It also provides a compelling value proposition to advertisers. In addition to its size, our audience has high purchase intent and is generally affluent — we estimate that over 50% of our audience has annual household income of more than $100,000.
•We have a proven engine to generate and recommend trusted content. We have invested heavily in developing both software and communities of contributors over the past 16 years to enable and encourage consumers to share their everyday business experiences through reviews, photos and other content. We have also developed recommendation software and other machine learning algorithms that help surface the most useful and trustworthy information on our platform for consumers. This technology, together with content moderation by our User Operations team and other consumer protection efforts, helps us detect and discourage attempts to manipulate ratings and reviews. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 70% of the reviews submitted to our platform were recommended.
•We have a scaled and extensible advertising technology platform. To establish the price of an individual ad click on our platform, we run an auction for each advertising unit displayed to a consumer on our website or mobile app. In 2020, we conducted an average of 18 million auctions per day. The bidding algorithms used in our auction system are designed to prioritize spending advertiser budgets efficiently and maximize ad clicks to optimize the value we deliver to advertisers, while our proprietary ad delivery technology is designed to determine the most relevant ads to display to consumers to drive fulfillment. We also employ our advertising platform to extend our audience reach through syndication of advertisements to other websites and mobile apps. 
Our Growth and Margin Strategy
We believe that the structural changes that we have made to our business model have positioned us to drive and sustain profitable growth, with significant opportunity for margin improvement, over the long term. In 2021, we plan to build on these changes and our financial recovery in the second half of 2020 by investing in product development, our Multi-location sales team and performance-based marketing to support a return to year-over-year revenue growth. We expect to make these investments primarily in the first half of 2021 and believe that, together with our plans to reduce costs by continuing to operate on a distributed basis, they will provide leverage in the second half of the year and into 2022. Our key strategic initiatives in 2021 reflect the continuation of many of our key initiatives from 2020:
Revenue Growth
•Improve monetization of our Services categories. Services businesses contributed 62% of our advertising revenue in 2020, yet only 20% of the leads we delivered to Services businesses — consisting of calls, requests and URL clicks — were attributable to an ad by the end of 2020. As a result, we believe that our substantial consumer traffic provides us with a large opportunity to increase revenue by monetizing more of the valuable leads we are already delivering to Services businesses. Because the needs of both consumers and businesses in our Services categories are generally distinct from those in our Restaurants, Retail & Other categories — restaurants, shopping, beauty & fitness, health and other — we believe that we will be able to both monetize more of our consumer traffic and convert more Services businesses into advertisers by offering an increasingly tailored product experience in the Services categories. In 2021, we plan to build new lead generation products, like Nearby Jobs, that result in higher quality leads while also improving the user experience by providing consumers with the tools they need to find and connect with the right Services businesses for their projects.
•Expand our Self-serve and Multi-location sales channels. We laid the groundwork for revenue growth in our most efficient sales channels — Self-serve and Multi-location — in 2021 by accelerating our go-to-market mix shift toward these channels in 2020. We plan to drive a larger percentage of SMB customer acquisition through our Self-serve channel in 2021 than in 2020 by providing advertisers with more targeting capabilities and controls over their advertising budgets, improving the reporting and analytics available in the business owner account, and using performance marketing to direct more businesses to the Self-serve purchase flow. We also plan to further expand our Multi-location sales and technical support teams, introduce new ad products tailored to larger advertisers, and enhance our reporting and analytics to both acquire new multi-location customers and expand our business with existing customers. 
•Deliver more value to advertisers. In recent years, we have improved customer satisfaction with our products and increased revenue retention by delivering greater value to advertisers in the form of more ad clicks and tailored product offerings. We believe that we can achieve further revenue retention gains through this approach. In 2021, we plan to continue improving the relevance and value of our ads by offering more tailored ad products and efficiently 
syndicating ads across the internet to drive more of our users' high-purchase intent leads to advertisers. We also believe there is opportunity to increase revenue retention by offering more bundled products. For example, we found that bundling our Yelp Connect product with a cost-per-click ("CPC") advertising package improved retention. We plan to expand the number of products that we offer for purchase on a bundled, subscription basis at a discount to their standalone pricing, including our Enhanced Profile and Connect products.
Margin Improvement
•Our revenue growth strategies also drive margin expansion. Improvements in revenue retention also benefit our margins and, accordingly, we believe our product investments designed to deliver more value to advertisers will also drive margin expansion. We expect that our plans to increase revenue from our Self-serve and Multi-location sales channels will also help improve our margins; in addition to being more margin-accretive than Local sales, these channels have historically exhibited better revenue retention characteristics than Local sales. As a result, we expect our Self-serve and Multi-location sales initiatives will help improve our overall revenue retention as revenue from these channels makes up an increasing percentage of our total advertising revenue.
•Reduce costs by operating on a distributed basis. Our ability to successfully operate with our employees working remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the feasibility of having a distributed workforce for our business. We plan to continue operating with a significant portion of our team working remotely on a full-time basis or coming into an office fewer than four days a week once it is safe to do so. We believe that this will allow us to reduce our reliance on the San Francisco Bay Area and potentially improve our productivity as we expand our presence and develop talent in lower-cost markets across the United States, Canada and Europe. It will also allow us to significantly reduce our real estate footprint, which we plan to begin working towards in 2021 by reducing our amount of office space as leases come up for renewal as well as by subleasing space.
Updated Key Metrics
As our business has changed in recent years, so too have the metrics we use to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends in our business, prepare financial projections and make strategic decisions. To provide better insight into the way we manage and monitor our business, we are making a number of changes to the key metrics we report by providing certain new metrics, providing a breakdown of certain existing metrics by high-level category groupings, and reporting certain existing metrics annually instead of quarterly. Please refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Metrics” in this Annual Report for more information about our key metrics, including these changes. 
Our Products and Services
Advertising
We provide a range of free and paid advertising products to businesses of all sizes, including through the products listed below, which provide the ability to deliver targeted search advertising to large local audiences. As in past years, advertising accounted for the vast majority of our revenue during the year ended December 31, 2020, contributing 96% of our revenue, which was fairly consistent with the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019. We recognize revenue from our business listing and advertising products, including advertising sold by partners, as advertising revenue.

Advertising Products 
CPC Search Advertising | We allow businesses to promote themselves as a sponsored search result on our platform, on the listing pages of related businesses, as suggested “additional businesses” for consumers using our Request-A-Quote feature, and as results in our Nearby Jobs product. We primarily sell performance-based ads, which our advertising platform matches to individual consumers through auctions priced on a CPC basis. We generate a majority of our advertising revenue from the sale of CPC advertising.
Multi-location Ad Products | We offer a range of ad products designed for multi-location advertisers, including: Showcase Ads, which showcase special offerings with limited-time localized promotions in relevant search results; and Seasonal Spotlight Ads, which highlight special offerings and promotions related to a holiday or seasonal event on the Yelp landing page. 


Business Listing Page Products
Free Online Business Account | Businesses have the ability to create a free online business account and claim the listing page for each of their business locations. Once a business has claimed its listing page, it can update its listing information and has the option to purchase premium listing page features. 
Upgrade Package | Our most popular product after search ads is our Upgrade Package, which includes our Enhanced Profile, Business Highlights, Yelp Portfolio and Yelp Connect products, each as described below, among other features. 
Branded Profile | Our Branded Profile product provides businesses with access to premium features in connection with their business listing pages, such as the ability to update listing information and select photos or videos to highlight on the page through a slideshow feature. 
Enhanced Profile | In addition to providing businesses with the same premium features and support options as our Branded Profile product, our Enhanced Profile product restricts how ads from other businesses appear on the business listing pages of our Enhanced Profile customers. 
Yelp Verified License | Yelp Verified License is a badge that appears on business listing pages as a paid upgrade for certain licensed advertisers, primarily in our home & local services category. The badge indicates that we have verified the business's trade license and confirmed it was in good standing as of a certain date, allowing businesses to distinguish themselves as licensed and helping consumers make safe and confident decisions when selecting businesses for their projects.
Business Highlights | Businesses in eligible categories can pay to highlight up to six attributes that make their business unique, such as "Family Owned" or "Pet Friendly." 
Yelp Portfolio | Our Yelp Portfolio product allows businesses to showcase their specialties to prospective customers through a photo collection of projects. 
Yelp Connect | Yelp Connect gives businesses an opportunity to tell users more about what makes their business special through posts appearing on their business listing pages. Yelp automatically promotes Yelp Connect posts to a business's followers. 
Yelp Logo | Yelp Logo provides businesses with the ability to display their logos in high-visibility locations, including prominently at the top of business listing pages and in search results. 

Transactions
In addition to our advertising products, we also offer features and consumer-interactive tools to facilitate transactions between consumers and the local businesses they find on Yelp. These features are primarily available through partner integration, the largest of which — by both transaction volume and revenue — is our partnership with Grubhub, which allows consumers to place food orders for pickup and delivery through Yelp. We recognize revenue from these sources on a net basis as transactions revenue.
Other
We generate other revenue through subscription services, licensing payments for access to Yelp data and other non-advertising, non-transaction arrangements. 

Yelp Reservations | We provide restaurants, nightlife and certain other venues with the ability to offer online reservations directly from their Yelp business listing pages through our Yelp Reservations product, which also includes front-of-house management tools. We offer this product as a monthly subscription service. 
Yelp Waitlist | Yelp Waitlist is a subscription-based waitlist management solution that allows consumers to check wait times and join waitlists remotely and businesses to efficiently manage seating and server rotation. Yelp Waitlist is available directly on business listing pages as well as in-store kiosks. 
Yelp Knowledge | Through partnerships with companies such as Sprinklr, InMoment and Chatmeter, our Yelp Knowledge program offers business owners local analytics and insights through access to our historical data and other proprietary content. Our Yelp Knowledge partners pay us license fees for access to Yelp Knowledge content. 
Yelp Fusion | Our Yelp Fusion program enables developers to build products that include our high-quality content and data. We partner with industry leaders like Apple, which makes our content available through Apple Maps and its virtual assistant Siri, as well as several auto manufacturers, including Mercedes, to make our content available in their in-dash experiences. We offer free access to certain basic information through our publicly available APIs as well as paid access to broader sets of content and data for consumer-facing enterprise use. We typically enter into multi-year license agreements with paying Yelp Fusion customers, with rates determined based on the type and volume of usage.
Other Partnerships | Other non-advertising partner arrangements include content licensing and allowing third-party data providers to update and manage business listing information on behalf of businesses. 

Sales
We sell our advertising products directly through our sales force, indirectly through partners and online through our website. 
Self-serve Ads. Our Self-serve sales channel allows businesses to purchase and manage their Yelp ads directly from our website or Yelp for Business Owners app. Businesses can purchase sponsored CPC search advertising, Yelp Connect and business listing page upgrades such as Business Highlights and Yelp Portfolios directly through this channel. The convenience of our Self-serve sales channel has helped us improve revenue retention and reduce our reliance on sales and customer support headcount, and continues to be a strategic priority for us. In 2020, we provided advertisers with new tools to manage their advertising campaigns and measure the performance of their ads, and we plan to invest further in expanding the scope of these tools in 2021 to drive SMB customer acquisition through this channel.
Direct Local Sales. Our Local sales team primarily sells CPC advertising to SMBs. Revenue from Local sales has historically comprised the largest share of advertising revenue and was driven by growth in Local sales headcount. As we have increased our focus on our more margin-accretive Self-serve and Multi-location channels in recent years, however, we have become less reliant on Local sales headcount to drive growth. We have been able to substantially reduce the size of the Local sales team accordingly and, while Local sales revenue was still the largest share of advertising revenue in 2020, its share has decreased in recent years as Self-serve and Multi-location sales revenue has increased. 
Local sales representatives are primarily responsible for generating qualified sales leads by identifying and contacting businesses through direct engagement, direct marketing campaigns and weekly e-mails to claimed local businesses. Although our Local sales team is primarily focused on increasing revenue by adding new customers, sales representatives on our client partner team engage with existing customers with the goal of increasing their overall spend. 
Multi-location Sales. Our Multi-location sales team is responsible for selling our advertising products to national, mid-market and franchise businesses. We believe our Multi-location sales channel continues to represent a large long-term growth opportunity, and we invested in our Multi-location sales team and national customer relationships in 2020 even as multi-location businesses were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We plan to continue investing in our Multi-location sales team and other initiatives to grow revenue from this channel in 2021.
Sales Partnerships. We also generate revenue through the resale of our advertising products by certain agencies and partners, such as Thryv, as well as monetization of remnant advertising inventory through third-party ad networks. Our Yelp Ads Certified Partners Program allows partner agencies to independently sell and manage ad campaigns on behalf of their SMB clients, providing increased centralization and flexibility. The products covered by these arrangements include all of our profile products as well as search advertising. 
Customer Success. Our customer success team supports existing business advertisers through account management, cross-selling and retention initiatives. 
Technology
We rely on a set of core technologies that enable us to be a trusted local resource for consumers and a partner in success to businesses of all sizes. We provide scalable services across platforms and devices using a combination of proprietary, open source and third-party technology solutions and products:
•Anticipating Consumer Needs. We analyze the large volumes of data collected from our platform and apply our proprietary indexing and ranking techniques to provide our users with contextual, relevant and up-to-date information. We also apply machine learning algorithms to predict user needs and preferences based on factors such as the user's recent activity, location, time of day and season, then tailor the user's experience on Yelp accordingly. In our Services categories, for example, if a user recently searched for movers, we might suggest searches for businesses offering self-storage or junk removal. Similarly, if our data suggests that a user is a homeowner, we might promote collections of businesses that offer spring cleaning or other seasonally appropriate services.
•Recommendation Software. Our recommendation software refers to the proprietary automated trust and safety software systems that we have developed to analyze the relevance, reliability and utility of each review submitted to our platform. “Recommended” reviews — those that the software deems to be the most useful and reliable — appear directly on business listing pages, while less trustworthy and unreliable content appear on secondary pages and do not factor into a business’s overall star rating. Our recommendation software applies the same objective standards to each review, regardless of whether the business being reviewed advertises on Yelp, based on hundreds of signals associated with the business, review and reviewer. These signals include the reviewer’s type and level of activity with Yelp (which might correspond to the reviewer’s reliability or suggest reviewer biases) and whether certain reviews originate from related Internet Protocol ("IP") addresses (which might mean the reviews were submitted by the same person). The software continuously evaluates each review based on hundreds of signals and, as a result, its analysis can change over time as new data becomes available; reviews that were previously recommended may become not recommended, and reviews that were previously not recommended may be restored to recommended status.
•Mobile Solutions. With our most engaged users on our mobile app, we have invested significant resources into developing a comprehensive mobile platform for consumers that supports the major smartphone operating systems available today, iOS and Android. Similarly, we designed our Yelp for Business Owners app to make it easier for businesses to engage with their customers and manage their presence on Yelp. Currently available for iOS and Android, this app provides businesses with daily metrics reports, page view analytics and leads data, as well as the ability to manage quote requests and opportunities in Nearby Jobs. Businesses can also purchase and manage Yelp ads through the Yelp for Business Owners app. In 2020, we launched several new features to give business owners more ability to customize their ad campaigns by selecting the type of engagement they want to drive, preventing their ad from appearing in results for specified searches and estimating their audience size based on different ad settings.
•Ad Delivery. We use proprietary ad targeting and delivery technologies that are designed to quickly target and display hyper-relevant advertisements to users of our platform. When a consumer enters a search on our app, these technologies determine the most relevant ads to show and serve those ads alongside the organic search results in less than half a second. Our targeting software leverages machine learning models that evaluate more than 350 signals about the user, business and search context to make sure consumers see the right ad at the right time and drive ad clicks.
•Auction System. We use an auction system to determine the price we charge advertisers for ad clicks. Our auction system uses advanced algorithms to bid on ad placements on behalf of advertisers, taking into account their budgets, current and predicted levels of relevant consumer traffic, changes in user behavior and competition from other advertisers, among other things. These bidding algorithms are also designed to prioritize spending advertiser budgets efficiently and maximize ad clicks, with the goal of delivering as much value to advertisers as possible. For example, if our models predict that relevant consumer traffic will meaningfully decrease for a period of time during an ad campaign, our bidding algorithms will dynamically allocate advertiser budget around that period to avoid spending a disproportionate amount of the budget while supply is constrained. We model traffic for more than nearly 16 million distinct time intervals across our business categories each year to power these algorithms.
•Infrastructure. The vast majority of our platform is currently hosted by Amazon Web Services from multiple locations, which allows us to scale our infrastructure dynamically according to demand as well as optimize the cost and performance of our infrastructure. Our platform is designed to have high availability, from the Internet connectivity 
providers we choose, to the servers, databases and networking hardware that we deploy. We design our systems such that the failure of any individual component is not expected to affect the overall availability of our platform. We also leverage other third-party cloud-based services such as content delivery networks, rich-content storage, map-related services, ad serving and bulk processing.
•Network Security. Computer viruses, malware, phishing attacks, denial-of-service and other attacks and similar disruptions from unauthorized use of computer systems have become more prevalent in our industry, have occurred on our systems in the past and we expect them to occur periodically on our systems in the future. For this reason, our platform includes a host of encryption, antivirus, multi-factor authentication, firewall and patch-management technologies designed to help protect and maintain the systems and computers across our business. We regularly conduct security audits and penetration tests of our applications and network infrastructure, as well as organize a bug reporting program that offers financial incentives to encourage security researchers to identify and report vulnerabilities.
Maintaining the Integrity of Our Content
Providing access to useful and reliable information to help inform consumers’ spending decisions is critical to our mission of connecting people with great local businesses. With fraudulent and deceptive behavior common across the internet, we have prioritized combating this conduct since our earliest days to maintain user trust and level the playing field for hard-working businesses that earn their great reputations. Our industry-leading trust and safety measures include investments in both technology and human moderation:
Recommendation Software. Our automated recommendation software is our first line of defense against unreliable content and misinformation submitted to our platform. As described in more detail under "—Technology" above, our recommendation software analyzes hundreds of signals related to reviews, businesses and reviewers in an effort to recommend the most useful and reliable reviews. Our recommendation software helps us mitigate misinformation at scale by detecting and de-emphasizing less trustworthy and unreliable activity, including content that may be:
•Biased: including reviews written by those with undisclosed ties to a business, such as competitors, disgruntled employees, friends or family.
•Solicited: when someone associated with a business requested the review, which can create a positive bias that is unfair to other businesses. When asked to write a review by a business, customers may feel pressured to give the business a higher star rating than someone who was inspired to write a review on their own. Businesses also tend to ask for reviews from customers they know will give them a great rating.
•Less reliable: including reviews written by less active users, who we don't know enough about to recommend their opinion to our community, and reviews connected to suspicious behavior, such as when a disproportionate number of reviews for a business are submitted from the same IP address.
•Less useful: including unhelpful rants and raves, as well as activity driven by a recent media story.
As of December 31, 2020, approximately 70% of the reviews submitted to our platform were recommended and approximately 22% were not recommended but still accessible on secondary pages. Although they do not factor into a business’s overall star rating, we provide access to reviews that are not recommended because they provide additional perspectives and information on reviewed businesses, as well as transparency of the efficacy of our recommendation software.
Community. Yelp has always been a community-driven review platform, and we encourage authentic content from the start of the user experience. We encourage users to complete a public profile, which not only helps build a community but also helps signal the reliability of their content. We also established the Yelp Elite Squad to provide recognition to users who are active in the Yelp community and consistently contribute high-quality content. We also work to educate our local business communities on our stance against review solicitation, why it harms consumers and how it can undermine a business’s reputation. We believe that by engaging with businesses and sharing our commitment to maintaining a level playing field, we can reduce the frequency with which businesses engage in such activities. 
In addition to encouraging reliable content and fair play from the outset, our communities serve as additional layers of oversight. For example, we provide easy ways for our communities of users and business owners to flag content that violates our guidelines, respond to reviews and update business information.
Human Content Moderation. In addition to investigating individual reports of content that violates our policies, our User Operations team conducts and facilitates larger investigations into attempts to deceive consumers. For example, we proactively work to identify businesses and individuals who offer or receive cash, discounts or other benefits in exchange for reviews, such as review solicitation and reputation management companies that offer to artificially inflate search rankings and online reputations. Our human-powered moderation is also able to identify and thwart more nuanced attempts to mislead consumers that platforms with less sophisticated and fully automated content moderation may miss. In 2018, for example, after learning that some crisis and faith-based pregnancy centers were misleading people seeking abortion care, our User Operations team manually investigated more than 2,000 business listings to verify that our platform was accurately representing the services that these clinics offered.
In addition to taking direct corrective action — such as recategorizing businesses to appropriately reflect their services, as in the example above — if we identify or confirm any such issues through our investigations, we typically pursue one or more of the courses of action described below (each of which we may also employ on a stand-alone basis).
Consumer Alerts Program. Our consumer alerts program warns consumers when we find evidence of extreme attempts to manipulate a business’s ratings and reviews or other egregious conduct that may harm consumers and unfairly put other businesses at a disadvantage. When we issue a consumer alert, a warning message appears above the review section of the business’s listing page with information about the reason for the alert and a link to the evidence we collected in support of the alert. We issue consumer alerts for the following types of activity:
•Media-fueled activity: in order for Yelp to remain a useful resource, reviews must be based on genuine, first-hand experiences. When people take to a business’s Yelp page to express their views after the business receives increased public attention, our User Operations team may temporarily disable the posting of content to the page and publish an alert as they investigate and remove content that violates our policies. In 2020, we expanded this category of alert to include businesses that gained public attention for either being accused of, or the target of, racist behavior.
•Suspicious review activity: this alert informs consumers if we have uncovered a disproportionate number of positive reviews submitted from the same IP address and show a concerted effort to inflate the business’s overall star rating on Yelp. We also issue this type of alert when we discover a business with a possible connection to a deceptive review ring.
•Compensated activity: we issue this type of consumer alert if we encounter a business attempting to purchase favorable reviews, incentivizing new or updated reviews, or offering compensation to remove negative reviews.
•Questionable legal threats: when we receive evidence that a business is making dubious legal threats against a reviewer or using a contractual gag clause to prevent critical reviews, we issue this type of alert to warn others that the business may be attempting to abuse the legal system to maintain an inflated star rating.
Removal of Reviews. We regularly remove reviews from our platform that we believe violate our terms of service, including, without limitation: fake or defamatory reviews; content that has been bought, sold or traded; and content that violates the rights of any third party or any applicable law. We also take steps to ensure that Yelp is a safe and welcoming place for everyone by removing threatening, harassing or lewd content, as well as hate speech and other displays of bigotry. Consumers can access information about reviews that we have removed for a particular business by clicking on a link on the business’s listing page. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 8% of the reviews submitted to our platform had been removed.
Coordination with Law Enforcement. We regularly cooperate with law enforcement and consumer protection agencies to investigate and identify businesses and individuals who may be engaged in false advertising or deceptive business practices relating to reviews. 
Legal Action. Our terms of service prohibit the buying and selling of reviews, as well as writing fake reviews. In egregious cases, we take legal action against businesses we believe to be engaged in deceptive practices based on these prohibitions.
Consumer Engagement
At the heart of our business are the vibrant communities of users that contribute the content on our platform. We help businesses succeed by empowering them to reach a large audience of purchase-oriented consumers, which depends on our ability to attract consumer traffic with valuable content. The rich, firsthand information about local businesses that our contributors share — in the form of reviews, ratings, photos and more — is the reason consumers come to Yelp when making their spending decisions and is therefore the foundation of our value proposition to businesses. Although measures of our content (including our cumulative review metric) and traffic (including our desktop and mobile unique visitors and app unique 
device metrics) do not factor directly into the advertising arrangements we have with our advertising customers, this dynamic underpins our ability to deliver ad clicks and drive conversion of advertisers' services. Increases in these metrics improve our value proposition to local businesses as they seek easy-to-use and effective advertising solutions.
Community Management
For the above reasons, we foster and support communities of contributors and make the consumer experience a top priority. We have a team of Community Managers and Community Ambassadors based across the United States and Canada whose primary goals are to support and grow communities of contributors in the local markets that they serve, raise brand awareness and engage with their surrounding communities through:
•planning and executing fun and engaging events for the community, such as parties, outings and activities at restaurants, museums, hotels and other local places of interest;
•getting to know community members and helping them get to know one another to foster an offline community experience that can be transferred online;
•promoting Yelp, including guest appearances on local television and radio, and at local events such as concerts and street fairs; and
•recurring weekly e-mail newsletters to share information with the community about local businesses, events and activities.
Through these activities, we believe our Community Management team helps us increase awareness of our platform and grow avid communities who are willing to contribute content to our platform. Even in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, our Community Management team is continuing these efforts by hosting virtual events and helping consumers and local businesses stay connected during these extraordinary times. We plan to continue these community development efforts in 2021. 
Yelp Elite Squad
Our Community Managers' responsibilities include engaging with our most important contributors — Yelp Elite Squad members. From the earliest days of Yelp, it was clear that some of our contributors went above and beyond with their prolific reviews, thoughtful photos and commitment to supporting local businesses by sharing their experiences. These users were not only active in their Yelp communities, but were also role models on and offline. Their voices helped make Yelp what it is today, and we started the Yelp Elite Squad to recognize these passionate individuals, signal our trust in them and their contributions, and encourage similar beneficial activities in our communities.
Beyond having well-written reviews, high-quality photos and a detailed personal profile, members are active evangelists for their Yelp communities. Yelp Elites receive a badge on their Yelp profile pages and Community Managers organize sponsored social events for them, which facilitates face-to-face interactions, builds the Yelp brand and fosters the sense of true community in which we believe so strongly. These behind-the-scenes looks at top-rated businesses often include interacting with business owners, hearing their unique stories and engaging with other locals in their community; however, Yelp Elites do not receive compensation for their contributions.
Intellectual Property
We rely on federal, state, common law and international rights, as well as contractual restrictions, to protect our intellectual property. We control access to our proprietary technology and algorithms by entering into confidentiality and inventions assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, as well as confidentiality agreements with third parties.
In addition to these contractual arrangements, we also rely on a combination of patent, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, service marks and domain names to protect our intellectual property. We pursue the registration of our copyrights, trademarks, service marks and domain names in the United States and in certain locations internationally. Our registration efforts have focused on gaining protection of our trademarks for Yelp and the Yelp burst logo, among others. These marks are material to our business and essential to our brand identity as they enable others to easily identify us as the source of the services offered under these marks. We currently have limited patent protection for our core business, which may make it more difficult to assert certain of our intellectual property rights. For example, the contractual restrictions and trade secrets that protect our proprietary technology and algorithms provide only a limited safeguard against infringement.
Circumstances outside our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property rights. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in the United States or other countries in which we operate. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete. Protecting our intellectual property rights is also costly and time consuming. Any unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results. 
Companies in the Internet, technology and media industries own large numbers of patents and other intellectual property rights, and frequently request license agreements or threaten to enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of such rights. From time to time, we receive notice letters from patent holders alleging that certain of our products and services infringe their patent rights. We are also currently subject to, and expect to face in the future, allegations that we have infringed the trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties, including our competitors and non-practicing entities. As we face increasing competition and as our business grows, we will likely face more claims of infringement.
Competition
We compete in rapidly evolving and intensely competitive markets, and we expect competition to intensify further in the future with the emergence of new technologies and market entrants. Our competitors consist of companies that help businesses — particularly businesses in our strategically important Services categories and, to a lesser extent, restaurants category — connect and engage with consumers, including:
•online search engines and directories, such as Google, as well as traditional, offline business guides and directories;
•online and offline providers of consumer ratings, reviews and referrals, such as TripAdvisor;
•providers of online marketing and tools for managing and optimizing advertising campaigns, such as Google, Facebook and Twitter, as well as various forms of traditional offline advertising, including radio, direct marketing campaigns, yellow pages and newspapers;
•restaurant reservation and seating tools, such as OpenTable, as well as food ordering and delivery services; and
•home and/or local services-related platforms and offerings, such as ANGI Homeservices.
Our competitors may enjoy competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories, substantially greater market share, established marketing relationships with, and access to, large existing user bases and substantially greater financial, technical and other resources. These companies may use these advantages to offer products similar to ours at a lower price, develop different products to compete with our current solutions and respond more quickly and effectively than we do to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or client requirements. Certain competitors could also use strong or dominant positions in one or more markets to gain competitive advantage against us in markets in which we operate.
We believe our ability to compete successfully for users, content, and advertising and other customers depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, including:
•the popularity, usefulness, ease of use, performance and reliability of our products and services compared to those of our competitors;
•our ability, in and of itself as well as in comparison to the ability of our competitors, to develop new products and services and enhancements to existing products and services;
•the quantity, quality and reliability of our content, including its breadth, depth and timeliness;
•our ad targeting and measurement capabilities, and those of our competitors;
•the size, composition and level of engagement of our consumer audience relative to those of our competitors;
•our marketing and selling efforts, and those of our competitors;
•the pricing of our products and services relative to those of our competitors;
•the actual or perceived return our customers receive from our products and services relative to returns from our competitors;
•the frequency and relative prominence of the ads displayed by us or our competitors;
•acquisitions or consolidation within our industry, which may result in more formidable competitors; and
•our reputation and brand strength relative to our competitors.
Government Regulation
As a company conducting business on the internet, we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to our business, including laws regarding privacy, data protection, data security, user-generated content and consumer protection, among others. For example:
•Privacy, Data Protection and Data Security. Because we receive, store and process personal information and other user data, including credit card information in certain cases, we are subject to numerous domestic and foreign privacy, data protection and data security laws and regulations restricting the collection, storing, use, processing and disclosure of personal information and other user data. The laws in many jurisdictions require companies to implement specific security controls to protect certain types of information. Likewise, many jurisdictions have laws in place requiring companies to notify users if there is a security breach that compromises certain categories of their information. For example, in the United States, many states require companies to implement reasonable security measures and all states and U.S. territories require businesses to notify affected individuals and government entities of the occurrence of certain security breaches affecting personal information.
•Liability for Third-Party Action. We rely on laws limiting the liability of providers of online services for activities of their users and other third parties, such as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act ("CDA 230") in the United States.
•Advertising. We are subject to a variety of laws, regulations and guidelines that regulate the way we distinguish paid search results and other types of advertising from unpaid search results.
We operate in a new and rapidly evolving industry, and many laws and regulations that impact our business are being proposed, still evolving or being tested in courts. The application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, and they could be interpreted and applied in ways that harm our business. They may also conflict with other rules, be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices. As our business grows and evolves, we will also become subject to additional laws and regulations, including in jurisdictions outside of the United States.
For example, laws providing immunity to websites that publish user-generated content are currently being tested by a number of claims, including actions based on invasion of privacy and other torts, unfair competition, copyright and trademark infringement and other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched, the ads posted or the content provided by users. There are also ongoing Congressional efforts to restrict the scope of the protections available to online platforms under CDA 230, and our current protections from liability for third-party content in the United States could decrease or change as a result. 
Regulatory frameworks for privacy issues in particular are also currently in flux worldwide, and are likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. In the United States, states have begun to introduce stringent and comprehensive privacy, data protection and data security legislation, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA"), which took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA and its implementing regulations give California residents expanded rights to access and require deletion of their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA will be expanded substantially on January 1, 2023, when the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (“CPRA”) becomes fully operative. The CPRA will, among other things, give California residents the ability to limit use of certain sensitive personal information, further restrict the use of cross-contextual advertising, establish restrictions on the retention of personal information, expand the types of data breaches subject to the CCPA’s private right of action, provide for increased penalties for CPRA violations concerning California residents under the age of 16, and establish a new California Privacy Protection Agency to implement and enforce the new law. If additional individual states pass privacy, data protection and data security laws that place different obligations or limitations on the processing of personal information of individuals in those states, it will become more complex to comply with these laws and our compliance costs and potential liability may increase. There is also discussion in Congress of new comprehensive federal data protection and privacy law to which we likely would be subject if it is enacted.
Foreign laws and regulations concerning privacy, data protection and data security are also evolving and are often more restrictive and burdensome than those in the United States; any failure on our part to comply with them may subject us to significant liabilities. For example, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), which took effect in 
2018, imposes comprehensive privacy, data protection and data security obligations on businesses and imposes significant penalties for non-compliance. Among other obligations under the GDPR, businesses are required to make contractual privacy, data protection and data security commitments; give detailed disclosures about how they collect, use and share personal information; maintain adequate security measures; notify regulators and affected individuals of certain personal information breaches; meet extensive governance and documentation requirements; and honor individuals’ rights to their personal information. 
European data protection laws including the GDPR also restrict the transfer of personal information from Europe to the United States and most other countries unless the parties to the transfer have implemented specific safeguards to protect the transferred personal information. However, recent judicial and administrative decisions have called into question the viability of one of the primary safeguards allowing such transfers, and there are currently few, if any, viable alternative safeguards. If we are unable to implement a valid solution for personal information transfers from Europe, we will face increased exposure to regulatory actions, substantial fines, and injunctions against processing or transferring personal information from Europe and may be required to increase our data processing capabilities in Europe at significant expense.
Other countries outside of Europe have enacted or are considering enacting similar cross-border data transfer restrictions and laws requiring local data residency as well, which could increase the cost and complexity of operating our business.
For additional information, see the section titled "Risk Factors—Our business is subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign regulations and other legal obligations related to privacy, data protection and other matters. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with such regulations and obligations could harm our business."
Human Capital Management
At Yelp, we deeply value our community of employees who are dedicated to fulfilling our mission of connecting people with great local businesses and to living our values of authenticity, tenacity, creativity, collegiality, and commitment to consumers and local communities. 
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 3,900 employees globally across the following teams:
Culture
We take great pride in our company culture and consider it to be one of our competitive strengths. Our culture is at the foundation of our success, and it continues to help drive our business forward as a pivotal part of our everyday operations. It allows us to attract and retain a talented group of employees, create an energetic work environment and continue to innovate in a highly competitive market. 
Employee Engagement. To ensure that we are maintaining our vibrant culture and addressing any areas of employee concern, we conduct an annual employee engagement survey to inform our plans, policies and programs. This survey covers a wide range of topics including: compensation and benefits; management; work-life balance; feedback and recognition; inclusion and belonging; and learning and development opportunities. In 2020, we also conducted a management effectiveness survey to gauge employees' confidence in the Company and its leaders, as well as a survey on COVID-19-related issues such as health and well-being, working remotely, communication, flexibility and returning to the office. We implemented a number of initiatives in response to the results of the COVID-19 survey, including expanding our wellness offerings, tailoring manager training sessions to include leading effectively in a remote work environment, and offering reimbursements for home office equipment.
Fostering Local Communities. Our culture extends beyond our offices and into the local communities in which people use Yelp. Our Community Management team’s responsibilities include fostering and supporting communities of users in the local markets that they serve, as well as encouraging consumers to share their experiences with local businesses. Community managers organize events throughout the year to engage our most important contributors, which facilitates face-to-face interactions, builds the Yelp brand and fosters the sense of true community in which we believe so strongly. We also engage with small businesses, including through conferences and events hosted by industry groups to interact with and get feedback from our core community of local business owners. Even in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are continuing these efforts by hosting virtual events and offering tools to help consumers and local businesses stay connected during these extraordinary times. 
Content Moderation. We place a high value on personal expression and provide a platform that encourages people to share their experiences. At the same time, we take active steps to ensure the trust and safety of our users, as well as to provide them with reliable content to inform their spending decisions. Our User Operations team is on the front lines of our consumer protection efforts; it works to ensure that the content on our platform meets our standards, including by evaluating reviews, photos and other information about businesses. User Operations also manages our consumer alerts program, which we expanded in 2020 to include warnings about businesses that have been accused of, or are the target of, racist incidents to help inform users' spending decisions and whether they will feel welcome. In addition to these content moderation efforts, our User Operations team also engages with the contributors and businesses impacted by our moderation decisions to promote constructive participation on Yelp.
Making a Difference. We endeavor to have a positive impact on the diverse communities in which people use Yelp by using our platform to raise awareness, promote economic opportunity for those in need and support organizations that serve local communities. Our initiatives in 2020 included: programs to support Black- and Latinx-owned businesses; promoting civic engagement through partnerships with Rock the Vote and When We All Vote to launch voter registration portals and encourage voter turnout; and allocating $10 million of our cash holdings to financial institutions that directly support the Black community in the United States to bring more capital to communities of color.
In addition, The Yelp Foundation (the “Foundation”), a non-profit organization established by our board of directors in 2011, directly supports consumers and local businesses in the communities in which we operate. In 2011, our board of directors approved the contribution and issuance to the Foundation of 520,000 shares of our common stock to fund the Foundation’s grants to local non-profit organizations that are actively engaged in supporting community and small business growth. The Foundation held 245,000 shares as of December 31, 2020, which represented less than 1% of our outstanding common stock.
Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging
Every local business has a unique story; having a diverse workforce means our employees are better equipped to relate to and solve for the diverse needs of consumers and businesses. As a result, we are committed to increasing diversity at all levels of our organization to reflect the diversity of the communities in which we live and work. Our executive diversity task force, which includes our chief executive officer, chief operating officer and chief financial officer, oversees the implementation of our diversity initiatives, including by holding individual department heads accountable for growing the diversity of their organizations. While our 2020 Diversity Report* — the details of which are set forth below — showed that we have more work to do, we believe that our efforts are having a positive impact.
Gender Diversity
Ethnic Diversity
*    Our 2020 Diversity Report, including the diversity data presented above, is based on self-reported information from our employees as of August 31, 2020, reflects judgments about our organizational structure and does not include employees who declined to provide the relevant information. The Native American grouping includes Native Americans, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islanders per U.S. EEO-1 reporting requirements. Leadership is defined as all people managers.
We also firmly believe that inclusion is just as important as diversity. We aim to cultivate a sense of belonging through company-supported employee resource and affinity groups, hosting events that provide our employees with the opportunity to celebrate and learn about the diverse cultures of their colleagues, and instituting a mandatory company-wide diversity training program that covers systemic racism and institutional bias.
Compensation and Benefits
Our future depends on our continuing ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and skilled employees. Qualified individuals are in high demand and we expect to continue to face significant competition from other companies in hiring and retaining such personnel. While our plans to operate with a significant portion of our employees working remotely may mitigate this challenge by expanding the pool of candidates from which we draw, we expect to continue to face significant competition for product and engineering employees in the San Francisco Bay Area in particular, where our headquarters is located and where the cost of living is high.
To attract and retain qualified employees, we offer competitive compensation and comprehensive benefits, including standard health, dental, vision, life and disability insurance benefits as well as a 401(k) plan with company matching. To foster a sense of ownership and align the interests of our employees and stockholders, we also grant equity awards, primarily in the form of restricted stock units, to eligible employees under our equity incentive plans. In addition, the Foundation offers up to $1,000 in matching donations each year to charitable organizations made by our regular full-time employees. 
We believe that happy employees are successful employees and that providing health and financial wellness programs translates to an overall better work experience. In addition to our insurance benefits, our wellness program includes a monthly 
wellness subsidy, access to mental health support and services through Talkspace and our Employee Assistance Program, as well as financial wellness programs such as financial counseling and tools to help manage student loans.
COVID-19 Response
Our focus on the health and well-being of our employees is also reflected in our response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We promptly took precautionary measures intended to minimize the risk of the virus to our employees and the communities in which we operate, such as migrating our workforce to work from home, providing additional time off to employees, offering various stipends for home office equipment and to assist with caregiver expenses, and communicating regularly with employees regarding the impacts of the pandemic, including health and safety protocols and procedures. We also hosted virtual trainings and events to help employees adapt to working and managing remotely, as well as maintaining their mental well-being while working and parenting from home.
Talent Development
To help our employees succeed in their current roles and to aid their career development, we emphasize continuous learning and development opportunities. Our learning and development programs begin with a company-wide onboarding program to integrate new employees and set them up for success at Yelp, which we believe is a critical foundation for both employee retention and role- or team-specific training. We similarly provide a development program for new people managers across the Company, which focuses on equipping new leaders with the critical skills necessary for effective leadership, including coaching, giving and receiving feedback, and conducting effective one-on-one meetings with reports, and is tailored to managing in a remote environment. We also offer on-demand resources to support people managers in areas such as leading through change and effective communication and engagement, as well as regular, ongoing training in compliance and workplace conduct matters to all employees.
Seasonality and Cyclicality
Our business is affected by seasonal fluctuations in Internet usage and advertising spending, as well as cyclicality in economic activity:
Seasonality. Based on historical trends, our revenue is typically lowest in the first quarter and increases through the year to its highest level in the fourth quarter; although SMBs typically decrease their advertising spending in the fourth quarter, our multi-location customers tend to increase their spending at that time. Our traffic is also typically weakest in the fourth quarter of the year in connection with year-end holidays. 
The impact of seasonality on our business in 2020 was overshadowed by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to substantial reductions in traffic and non-term advertiser budgets in March and April 2020. Traffic levels fluctuated inversely with COVID-19 case counts and shelter-in-place restrictions. After the substantial negative impact from the initial wave of cases and restrictions, traffic rebounded as cases dropped and restrictions were lifted in the third and early fourth quarters, with app unique devices increasing from 28 million in the second quarter to 32 million in the third quarter, each on a monthly average basis. As case counts increased and restrictions were reimposed mid-fourth quarter, though, traffic was again negatively impacted and app unique devices in the fourth quarter were down year over year at 30 million on a monthly average basis. 
Revenue was less sensitive to fluctuations in case counts and restrictions than traffic in the second half of 2020 and generally improved from its low in the second quarter over the remainder of the year, growing 38% from the second quarter to the fourth quarter. However, revenue declined year over year in the fourth quarter despite this recovery.
These general trends masked wide variation among our business categories depending on the extent to which categories were impacted by physical distancing measures. For example, even as restrictions eased in the third and early fourth quarters, page views and searches in more impacted categories such as restaurants remained far below pre-pandemic levels. By comparison, home & local services remained resilient throughout the pandemic, with page views and searches exceeding pre-pandemic levels by June 2020 and revenue from these categories up year over year in both the fourth quarter and full year 2020.
While the positive trends we observed over the summer months give us confidence that traffic will return organically as people are vaccinated and the pandemic recedes in 2021, the pace of vaccinations in the United States and the timeframe for the lifting of COVID-19-related restrictions remain uncertain and subject to risk.
Cyclicality. SMBs have historically experienced high failure rates, and we must continually add new advertisers to replace those who do not renew their advertising due to factors outside of our control, such as declining advertising budgets, closures or 
bankruptcies. As a result, SMBs may be disproportionately affected by negative fluctuations in the business cycle, and a worsening economic outlook would likely cause such businesses to decrease investments in advertising, which would adversely affect our revenue. This has been the case in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic; while some restrictive measures to control the spread of COVID-19 have eased recently, they have had and are continuing to have significant macroeconomic impacts that have been particularly challenging for SMBs. These circumstances, along with uncertainty regarding the pace of vaccinations and the timing of the economic recovery, are having an ongoing adverse impact on our business and results of operations. While we believe the U.S. economy will continue to strengthen in 2021, we do not anticipate a full recovery before 2022.
