ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Unless otherwise indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to the "Company," "we," "us," "our" and similar expressions are references to PROG Holdings, Inc. ("PROG Holdings") and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Overview
PROG Holdings is a financial technology holding company based in Salt Lake City, Utah. We have two operating segments: (i) Progressive Leasing, which offers lease-to-own transactions primarily to credit-challenged consumers, through point-of-sale and e-commerce retail partners, via in-store, mobile and online solutions; and (ii) Vive Financial ("Vive"), which provides customers who may not qualify for traditional prime lending with a variety of second-look, revolving credit products, through private label and Vive-branded credit cards. Our Progressive Leasing segment provides consumers with lease-purchase solutions for merchandise, including furniture, appliances, electronics, jewelry, mobile phones and accessories, mattresses, and automobile electronics and accessories from leading traditional and e-commerce retailers (whom we refer to as our point-of-sale partners or "POS partners"). Progressive Leasing purchases from its POS partners the merchandise desired by customers and, in turn, leases the merchandise to the customers through a lease-to-own transaction. Progressive Leasing's technology-based, proprietary decisioning platform offers prompt lease decisioning at the point-of-sale and is integrated with both traditional and e-commerce POS partners. Progressive Leasing provides customers with transparent and competitive lease payment options along with flexible terms, intended to help customers achieve merchandise ownership, including through low initial payments and early buyout options. Approximately 46% of the leases executed during the year ended December 31, 2020 were with repeat customers, which we believe demonstrates a high level of satisfaction. The lease-to-own transactions also benefit Progressive Leasing's POS partners by generating incremental sales with credit-challenged consumers, who typically would not have qualified for financing offers traditionally provided by these retailers. Progressive Leasing has funded over 10 million leases since its inception in 1999. 
On November 30, 2020, PROG Holdings (previously Aaron's Holdings Company, Inc.) completed the separation of its Aaron's Business segment from its Progressive Leasing and Vive segments. The separation was effected through a tax-free distribution of all outstanding shares of common stock of The Aaron's Company, Inc. (referred to herein as "The Aaron's Company") to PROG Holdings shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 27, 2020 (referred to as the "separation and distribution transaction"). Through that distribution, shareholders of PROG Holdings received one share of The Aaron's Company for every two shares of PROG Holdings common stock. Upon completion of the separation and distribution transaction on November 30, 2020, The Aaron's Company became an independent, publicly traded company under the symbol "AAN" on the New York Stock Exchange, while PROG Holdings continued to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the new symbol "PRG".
Strategy
Our strategy to drive growth in our business, which we believe positions us for success over the long-term, includes the following:
•Grow gross merchandise volume ("GMV") with existing and new POS partners - We plan to grow GMV through strategic collaboration and marketing efforts with our POS partners. We remain focused on converting our existing pipeline of retailers into new POS partners. Our ability to maintain and strengthen new and existing relationships, including addressing the changing needs of our POS partners, is critical to the long-term growth of our business. 
•Invest in technology that simplifies and improves the customer experience - We are investing in technology platforms that promote customer engagement and simplify the lease application, origination and servicing experience. We are committed to providing our customers with greater choice and flexibility in how and where they choose to shop. We are expanding and innovating our e-commerce capabilities to benefit existing and new POS partners and customers.
•Leverage our large database to drive repeat business - We are leveraging our database of over 10 million leases to offer current and previous customers with products and solutions that meet their needs. 
•Broaden our product ecosystem through research and development ("R&D") efforts and strategic acquisitions - We plan to expand our products through internal R&D efforts and potential strategic acquisitions.
•Employ direct-to-consumer marketing to drive shoppers in-store and online -  We plan to continue expanding our direct-to-consumer marketing efforts to attract new customers and drive more GMV through our POS partners.
Operating Segments
As of December 31, 2020, the Company has two operating and reportable segments: Progressive Leasing and Vive, which is consistent with the current organizational structure and how the chief operating decision maker regularly reviews results to analyze performance and allocate resources. 
The operating results of our two reportable segments may be found in (i) Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and (ii) Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 
Progressive Leasing 
Progressive Leasing partners with traditional and e-commerce retailers, primarily in the furniture, appliances, electronics, jewelry, mobile phones and accessories, mattresses, and automobile electronics and accessories markets to offer a lease-purchase solution for customers who may not have access to traditional credit-based financing options. It does so by offering leases with monthly, semi-monthly, bi-weekly, and weekly payment terms.
Established in 1999, Progressive Leasing is a leader in the expanding lease-to-own market. Progressive Leasing offers a proprietary, technology-based application and approval process that does not require its employees to be staffed in its POS partners' stores. Once a customer has selected their merchandise and is approved, Progressive Leasing purchases the merchandise from the POS partner and enters into a lease-to-own transaction with the customer. The lease agreement provides the customer flexibility through multiple ownership alternatives, including the ability to exercise early purchase options. Progressive Leasing provides lease-purchase solutions through approximately 25,000 POS partner locations and e-commerce websites in 45 states and the District of Columbia, and operates under federal regulatory agency oversight, including the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC"), as well as state-and-District of Columbia-specific regulations.
Vive
Vive primarily serves customers that may not qualify for traditional prime lending offers who desire to purchase goods and services from participating merchants. Vive offers customized programs, with services that include revolving loans through private label and Vive-branded credit cards. Vive's current network of over 3,000 point-of-sale partner locations and e-commerce websites includes furniture, mattresses, fitness equipment, and home improvement retailers, as well as medical and dental service providers. The Company believes the Vive product offerings are complementary to those of Progressive Leasing and allow Progressive Leasing to expand into the markets and POS partners that Vive serves. 
Vive extends or declines credit to an applicant through third-party bank partners based upon the applicant's credit profile. Vive's bank partners originate the loan by providing financing to our POS partner at the point-of-sale and acquire the receivables at a discount from the loan face value. Vive then acquires the receivable from the bank and services the account.
Qualifying customers receive a credit card to finance their initial purchase and to use in subsequent purchases at the POS partner or other participating partners and Vive will renew the account if the customer remains active and in good standing. The customer is required to make minimum monthly payments and may pay certain annual and other periodic fees. 
Operations
Operating Strategy
The Company's operating strategy is based on distinguishing our Progressive Leasing and Vive brands from those of our competitors, along with maximizing our operational efficiencies. Our Progressive Leasing and Vive operating strategies are based on providing excellent service to their POS partners and customers, along with continued development and enhancement of technology-based solutions. We believe this strategy will allow us to grow and generate incremental sales for our POS partners, while realizing operating efficiencies with scale. Progressive Leasing's ability to service its POS partners with limited labor costs allows us to offer lease-purchase solutions that are lower than other options available to our customers.
Lease Agreement Customer Experience
The following summarizes the Progressive Leasing customer experience:
Lease Agreement Decisioning Process 
Progressive Leasing uses proprietary decisioning algorithms to determine which applicants meet our leasing qualifications and the lease amount for which customers are approved. The decisioning data set contains over 10 million leases with mature lease performance data and other information provided from third party sources. Progressive Leasing's proprietary algorithms utilize the application, customer history, known fraud attributes, retailer/vertical performance and other information in the decision process. In 2020, 97% of lease decisions were completely automated, with a median decision time of 5.7 seconds. 
Lease Agreement Renewal and Collection
The customer has the option to acquire ownership of merchandise over a fixed term, usually 12 months, by making weekly, bi-weekly, semi-monthly, or monthly lease payments. The customer may cancel the agreement at any time without penalty by returning the merchandise to Progressive Leasing. If the customer leases the item through the completion of the full term, he or she then obtains ownership of the item. The customer may also purchase the item at any time by tendering the contractually specified payment.
Contractual payments are usually based on a customer's pay frequency and are typically processed through automated clearing house payments. If the payment is unsuccessful, collections are managed in-house through our call centers and proprietary lease management system. The call center contacts customers within a few days after the due date to encourage them to keep their agreement current. If the customer chooses to return the merchandise, arrangements are made to receive the merchandise from the customer, either through our retail partners, our Draper, Utah location, or our Progressive Leasing hub facilities.
The provision for lease merchandise write-offs as a percentage of lease revenues was 5.4%, 7.2% and 6.2% in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We believe that our collection and recovery policies comply with applicable laws, and we discipline any employee we determine to have deviated from such policies.
Vive's Credit Agreement Approval and Collection
Vive partners with merchants to provide a variety of revolving credit products originated through third-party federally insured banks to customers that may not qualify for traditional prime lending offers (called "second-look" financing programs). We believe Vive provides the following strategic benefits:
•Enhanced product for retail partners - Vive has a centralized, scalable underwriting model with a long operating history, deployed through its established bank partners, and a proprietary receivable management system. 
•Higher consumer credit quality - Vive primarily serves customers with Fair Isaac and Company ("FICO") scores between 600 and 700, which make up approximately a quarter of the U.S. population. These customers generally have credit profiles that are typically stronger than Progressive Leasing's current customers. 
•Expanded customer base - Vive's strong relationships with POS partners who provide services, instead of or in addition to merchandise or other products, offer an additional channel for longer-term growth.
Vive uses an underwriting model that provides standardized credit decisions, including borrowing limit amounts. Credit decisions are primarily based on a proprietary underwriting algorithm. Loans receivable are unsecured, and collections on loans receivable are managed in-house through Vive's call center and proprietary loans receivable management system. 
Customer Service
A critical component of the success of our operations is the commitment by Progressive Leasing and Vive to develop good relationships with our customers. Progressive Leasing and Vive consistently monitor consumer preferences and trends to ensure that their business models are aligned with their customers' needs. We believe that building a relationship with the customer that ensures customer satisfaction is critical to our long-term success. Our goal, therefore, is to develop a positive experience with our customers, and for our products, service and support in the minds of our customers from the moment they enter the stores or e-commerce websites of our POS partners.
We believe the strong focus by Progressive Leasing and Vive on customer satisfaction generates repeat business from their customers and long-lasting relationships with their POS partners. Progressive Leasing and Vive customers are provided access to products through multiple channels, including Progressive Leasing's and Vive's network of POS partner locations and e-commerce sites, which provide their customers with multiple complimentary service benefits. These benefits generally include early purchase options, reinstatement options, product replacement, discounts and other benefits. In addition, Progressive Leasing and Vive offer payment deferral options and other payment adjustment options to customers who are experiencing financial difficulties, such as to those customers who have been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to increase leasing transactions, Progressive Leasing fosters relationships with its POS partners and existing customers to attract recurring business. Our Progressive Leasing business offers centralized customer and retailer support through call centers located in Draper, Utah and Glendale, Arizona.
Progressive Leasing's commitment to its customers is ongoing throughout their lease term. Progressive Leasing customers have the option to cancel their lease-to-own agreement and return the merchandise at any time. We provide customers the convenience to return merchandise by either scheduling a pick-up or shipping the merchandise to our warehouse in Draper, Utah. Progressive Leasing partners with multiple third party vendors to sell its returned merchandise. 
Purchasing and Retail Relationships
The following table shows the percentage of Progressive Leasing's revenues attributable to different categories of merchandise offered by its POS partners:

 | Year Ended December 31,
Progressive Leasing POS Partner Merchandise Category | 2020 | | 2019 | | 2018
Furniture, appliances and electronics | 57 | % | | 53 | % | 54 | %
Jewelry | 14 | % | | 16 | % | 14 | %
Mobile phones and accessories | 13 | % | | 12 | % | 9 | %
Mattress | 9 | % | | 10 | % | 12 | %
Automobile electronics and accessories | 5 | % | | 7 | % | 9 | %
Other | 2 | % | | 2 | % | 2 | %

Revenues from a POS partner are attributed to a single category even if the POS partner may carry merchandise across multiple categories.
Progressive Leasing also classifies some electronics within mobile phones and accessories, automobile electronics and accessories, and other.
During 2020, three Progressive Leasing POS partners each individually provided customer relationships that generated greater than 10% of our consolidated revenues. 
The following table shows the percentage of Vive's revenues attributable to different categories of services and merchandise offered by its POS partners:

 | Year Ended December 31,
Vive POS Partner Services and Merchandise Category1 | 2020 | | 2019 | | 2018
Furniture and Mattresses | 41 | % | | 32 | % | 22 | %
Medical | 32 | % | | 43 | % | 50 | %
Home Exercise and Home Improvement | 9 | % | | 8 | % | 10 | %
Other | 18 | % | | 17 | % | 18 | %

1Revenues from a POS partner are attributed to a single category even if the POS partner may offer services or merchandise across multiple categories.
Marketing and Advertising
Progressive Leasing and Vive execute their marketing strategies in partnership with POS partners. This is typically accomplished through in-store signage and marketing material, direct marketing activities, and the education of sales employees.
Competition
Our Progressive Leasing segment competes with national, regional and local operators of lease-to-own stores, virtual lease-to-own companies, traditional and e-commerce retailers (including many that offer layaway programs and title or installment lending), traditional and online sellers of used merchandise, and various types of consumer finance companies that may enable our customers to shop at traditional or online retailers, as well as with rental stores that do not offer their customers a purchase option. Our Vive segment competes with retail stores for customers desiring to purchase merchandise for cash or on credit. Competition is based primarily on product selection and availability, customer service and lease rates, store location and terms. 
Working Capital
Progressive Leasing's most significant working capital asset is merchandise on lease. As Progressive Leasing continues to grow, the need for additional lease merchandise is expected to remain a major working capital requirement. Vive's most significant working capital asset are loans receivable. Consistent and dependable sources of liquidity are required to purchase such merchandise and originate new loans through Vive's third-party bank partners. Failure to maintain adequate sources of liquidity to purchase lease merchandise and originate new loans could materially adversely affect our Progressive Leasing and Vive businesses. We believe our cash on hand, operating cash flows, and availability under our revolving facility agreement are adequate to meet our normal liquidity requirements. 
Human Capital
Diversity and inclusion is integral to our ability to grow and thrive. We respect the dignity and diversity of all people. We strive to nurture a culture of inclusion, holding all employees accountable for advancing our culture of belonging while supporting a diverse environment free from discrimination, harassment and bullying. 
By supporting a diverse and inclusive workplace, our employee resource groups help to ensure the many experiences of our diverse employees, customers and communities are reflected in our decisions and actions. Both of our Progressive Leasing and Vive operating segments continue to focus on hiring, retention and advancement of women and underrepresented groups. Our vision is to cultivate a welcoming and nurturing workplace that will activate the next generation of innovators. For example, Black Inclusion Group (B.I.G) was created to enrich professional and leadership development of African-American and Black employees by fostering mentoring, retention and community engagement to advance diversity and inclusion within the Company, and drive strong business and career growth. Our Women in Leadership (W.I.L.) group creates a culture that inspires women to develop their leadership abilities, take advantage of growth opportunities and increase their knowledge of the Company for organizational and personal success. Our vision is to cultivate a welcoming workplace environment for all employees.
We foster a culture of learning that provides employees with development opportunities to support their unique career paths. We support our employees in owning their development and growth, and we provide development training and resources to empower employees to achieve their personal best at work. We provide an online learning curriculum that includes content around compliance and specific business-related needs in multiple delivery formats, as well as tools, assessments, videos and digital learning modules, which are available live, in-person and online. 
We empower our employees to give to causes they feel passionately about, through volunteering, making financial donations, which we match up to certain limits, serving as nonprofit board members, and participating in our Company-sponsored Day of Service.
We work to ensure that our employment practices comply with all applicable local, state and federal laws, including those concerning equal opportunity, compensation and safe working conditions. We strive to achieve shared, meaningful goals and commit to open communication where individuals have no fear of expressing themselves freely and respectfully where, for example, they in good faith believe they need to raise a concern regarding a potential violation of law or Company policies.
We offer our employees fair and competitive wages and benefits which include (i) health benefits consisting of medical, dental, vision, life insurance, short-term and long-term disability insurance; (ii) paid parental leave; (iii) Company matched 401(k); (iv) paid time off, paid holidays, and paid volunteer hours; (v) an employee stock purchase program; (vi) tuition reimbursement; and (vii) charitable gift matching. 
For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, personnel expenses were $190.7 million, $181.2 million, and $161.5 million, respectively.
As of December 31, 2020, our employee count was 1,728 for Progressive Leasing and 140 for Vive, the majority of which were full time employees. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe that our relations with employees are good.
As of December 31, 2020, our employees are represented by the following gender demographics and self-identified nationalities:

 | December 31, 2020
Gender Demographics | % of Total 
Female | 49.5% 
Male | 50.5% 


 | | December 31, 2020
Nationality | | % of Total 
American Indian or Alaska Native | 1% 
Asian | 4% 
Black or African American | 7% 
Hispanic or Latino | 23%
Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander | 2% 
Two or more races (not Hispanic or Latino) | 3% 
White | 60%

Seasonality
Progressive Leasing's revenue mix is moderately seasonal. Adjusting for growth, the first quarter of each year generally has higher revenues than any other quarter. This is primarily due to realizing the full benefit of business that historically gradually increases in the fourth quarter as a result of the holiday season, as well as the receipt by our customers in the first quarter of federal and state income tax refunds. Our customers will more frequently exercise the early purchase option on their existing lease agreements or purchase merchandise during the first quarter of the year. We expect these trends to continue in future periods. 
Industry Overview
The Lease-to-Own Industry
The lease-to-own industry offers customers an alternative to traditional methods of obtaining home furnishings, electronics, appliances, computers, jewelry, and other consumer goods. In a standard industry lease-to-own transaction, the customer has the option to acquire ownership of merchandise over a fixed term, usually 12 months, by making weekly, bi-weekly, semi-monthly, or monthly lease payments. The customer may cancel the agreement at any time without penalty by returning the merchandise to the lessor. If the customer leases the item through the completion of the full term, he or she then obtains ownership of the item. The customer may also purchase the item at any time by tendering the contractually specified payment.
The lease-to-own model is particularly attractive to customers who are unable to pay the full upfront purchase price for merchandise or who lack the credit to qualify for conventional financing programs. Other individuals who find the lease-to-own model attractive are customers who, despite access to credit, do not wish to incur additional debt, have only a temporary need for the merchandise or desire to field test a particular brand or model before purchasing it.
Government Regulation
Our operations are extensively regulated by and subject to the requirements of various federal, state and local laws and regulations, and are subject to oversight by various government agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC"), for example, which may exercise oversight of the advertising and other business practices of our Company. In general, such laws regulate applications for leases, pricing, late charges and other fees, lease disclosures, the content of advertising materials, and certain collection procedures. Violations of certain provisions of these laws may result in material penalties. We are unable to predict the nature or effect on our operations or earnings of unknown future legislation, regulations and judicial decisions or future interpretations of existing and future legislation or regulations relating to our operations, and there can be no assurance that future laws, decisions or interpretations will not have a material adverse effect on our operations, earnings or financial condition. We continue to believe and set expectations that all employees are to behave in an ethical manner and to comply with all laws and regulations governing our Company's behavior.
A summary of certain laws under which we operate follows. This summary does not purport to be a complete summary of the laws referred to below or of all the laws regulating our operations.
Federal regulatory authorities, such as the FTC, are increasingly focused on the subprime financial marketplace in which the lease-to-own industry operates, and any of these agencies may propose and adopt new regulations, or interpret existing regulations, in a manner that could result in significant adverse changes in the regulatory landscape for businesses such as ours. In addition, with increasing frequency, federal and state regulators are holding businesses like ours to higher standards of training, monitoring and compliance. From time to time, federal regulatory agencies and state attorneys general have directed investigations or regulatory initiatives toward our industry, or toward certain companies within the industry. For example, as we have disclosed previously, in July 2018 we received a civil investigative demand ("CID") from the FTC regarding disclosures related to lease-to-own and other financial products offered by the Company, and whether such disclosures are in violation of the FTC Act. Although we believe such disclosures were in compliance with the FTC Act and have not admitted to any wrongdoing, we reached a settlement with the FTC under which we agreed to make a lump sum payment of $175 million to the FTC, and entered into a consent order which, among other matters, required Progressive Leasing to undertake certain compliance related activities, including monitoring, disclosure and reporting requirements. The proposed consent order was approved by the FTC on April 17, 2020 and approved by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia on April 22, 2020. The Company paid the $175.0 million settlement amount to the FTC on April 27, 2020. The settlement and related consent order could lead to investigations and enforcement actions by, and/or consent orders with, state attorneys general and regulatory agencies. We cannot predict whether any state attorneys general or federal regulatory agencies will direct other investigations or regulatory initiatives towards us or our industry in the future, or what the impact of any such future regulatory initiatives may be.
In addition to federal regulatory oversight, currently, nearly every state specifically regulates lease-to-own transactions via state statutes. This includes states in which our Progressive Leasing business has POS partners. Most state lease purchase laws require lease-to-own companies to disclose to their customers the total number of payments, total amount and timing of all payments to acquire ownership of any item, any other charges that may be imposed and miscellaneous other items. The more restrictive state lease purchase laws limit the retail price for an item, the total amount that a customer may be charged for an item, or regulate the "cost-of-rental" amount that lease-to-own companies may charge on lease-to-own transactions, generally defining "cost-of-rental" as lease fees paid in excess of the "retail" price of the goods. Our long-established policy in all states is to disclose the terms of our lease purchase transactions as a matter of good business ethics and customer service. We believe we are in material compliance with the various state lease purchase laws. At the present time, no federal law specifically regulates the lease-to-own transaction. Federal legislation to regulate the transaction has been proposed from time to time. In addition, certain elements of the business including matters such as collections activity, marketing disclosures to customers and customer contact may be subject to federal laws and regulation. 
There has been increased legislative and regulatory attention in the United States, at both the federal and state levels, on financial services products offered to near-prime and subprime consumers in general, which may result in an increase in legislative and/or regulatory efforts directed at the lease-to-own industry. We cannot predict whether any such legislation or regulations will be enacted and what the impact would be on us. 
Vive is subject to various federal and state laws that address lending regulations, consumer information, consumer rights, and certain credit card specific requirements, among other things. In addition, Vive services credit cards issued through third party bank partners and therefore is subject to those banks' Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation regulators. Additional regulations are being developed as the attention placed on the True Lender Doctrine and consumer debt transactions has grown significantly. We believe we are in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Although we are unable to predict the results of any regulatory initiatives, we do not believe that existing and currently proposed regulations will have a material adverse impact on our Progressive Leasing, Vive or other business operations.
Intellectual Property
Intellectual property and proprietary rights are important to the success of our business. We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, and other contractual protections, to establish and protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights, including our proprietary technology, software, know-how, and brand. However, these laws, agreements, and procedures provide only limited protection. We own, or are otherwise entitled to use, the various trademarks, trade names, service marks, and taglines used in our businesses, including those used with the operations of Progressive Leasing and Vive Financial®. We intend to file for additional trade name and trademark protection when appropriate. As of December 31, 2020, we owned seven registered trademarks and five pending trademarks in the United States.
Although we rely on intellectual property and proprietary rights, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets, as well as contractual protections, in our business, we also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our intellectual property and proprietary rights through appropriate technological restrictions, such as physical and electronic security measures. We believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel and frequent enhancements to our network are also essential to establishing and maintaining our competitive position.
