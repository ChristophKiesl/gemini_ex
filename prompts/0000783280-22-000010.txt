Item 1.  Business
Company Overview
The General Partner and Partnership collectively specialize in the ownership, management and development of industrial real estate. 
The General Partner is a self-administered and self-managed REIT, which began operations upon completion of an initial public offering in February 1986. 
The Partnership was formed in October 1993, when the General Partner contributed all of its properties and related assets and liabilities, together with the net proceeds from an offering of additional shares of its common stock, to the Partnership. Simultaneously, the Partnership completed the acquisition of Duke Associates, a full-service commercial real estate firm operating in the Midwest whose operations began in 1972. The General Partner is the sole general partner of the Partnership, owning 99.1% of the Common Units at December 31, 2021. The remaining 0.9% of the Common Units are owned by limited partners. Limited partners have the right to redeem their Limited Partner Units, subject to certain restrictions. Pursuant to the Fifth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership, as amended (the "Partnership Agreement"), the General Partner is obligated to redeem the Limited Partner Units in shares of its common stock, unless it determines in its reasonable discretion that the issuance of shares of its common stock could cause it to fail to qualify as a REIT. Each Limited Partner Unit shall be redeemed for one share of the General Partner's common stock, or, in the event that the issuance of shares could cause the General Partner to fail to qualify as a REIT, cash equal to the fair market value of one share of the General Partner's common stock at the time of redemption, in each case, subject to certain adjustments described in the Partnership Agreement. The Limited Partner Units are not required, per the terms of the Partnership Agreement, to be redeemed in registered shares of the General Partner. 
At December 31, 2021, we owned or jointly controlled 548 primarily industrial properties which encompassed 162.7 million rentable square feet (including 40 unconsolidated joint venture in-service properties with 12.9 million square feet, 29 consolidated properties under development with 8.5 million square feet and two unconsolidated joint venture properties under development with 1.2 million square feet). Our properties are leased by a diverse base of more than 800 tenants whose businesses include logistics, e-commerce, manufacturing, wholesale trade and retailing. We have one tenant, to whom we both lease a significant amount of space and also provide general contractor and construction management services, from whom we derived greater than 10.0% of our total revenues.
We also owned, including through ownership interests in unconsolidated joint ventures (with acreage not adjusted for our percentage ownership interest), 431 acres of land and controlled an additional 925 acres through purchase options. 
Our headquarters and executive offices are located in Indianapolis, Indiana. We additionally have regional offices or significant operations in 18 other geographic or metropolitan areas including Atlanta, Georgia; Chicago, Illinois;

Company Strategies
Our overall strategy is to maximize cash flows from operations, increase our investment in Coastal Tier 1 markets (we define "Coastal Tier 1" markets as Southern California, Northern California, Seattle, Northern New Jersey and South Florida) and to maintain a strong balance sheet. 
Operational Strategy
Our operational focus is to drive profitability by maximizing cash from operations and earnings through (i) maintaining property occupancy, increasing rental rates and prioritizing timely collection of monthly rental payments, while also keeping lease-related capital costs contained, by effectively managing our portfolio of existing properties and (ii) providing a broad line of real estate services to our tenants and to third parties.
Asset Strategy
Our strategic objectives include (i) increasing our investment in quality industrial properties through development, with sustainable design features that will meet customer needs; (ii) acquiring properties primarily in Coastal Tier 1 markets, which we believe provide the best potential for future rental growth; and (iii) maintaining an optimal land inventory through selected strategic land acquisitions to support new development activity. We continue to execute our asset strategy through a disciplined approach by identifying development opportunities and identifying select acquisition targets where the asset quality and pricing meet our objectives.
Capital Strategy
Our capital strategy is to maintain a strong balance sheet by actively managing the components of our capital structure in coordination with the execution of our overall operational and asset strategies. We are focused on maintaining our current investment grade ratings from our credit rating agencies. As of December 31, 2021, our senior unsecured notes have been assigned a rating of Baa1 by Moody's Investors Services and BBB+ by Standard & Poor's Ratings Group and we are focused on maintaining such ratings in order to maintain access to liquidity. A securities rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities and is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization. 
In support of our capital strategy, we continually evaluate our portfolio and regularly identify and dispose of assets that no longer meet our long-term objectives.
We continue to focus on maintaining a balanced and flexible capital structure which includes: (i) extending and sequencing the maturity dates of our outstanding debt obligations; (ii) borrowing primarily at fixed rates; and (iii) issuing common equity as needed to maintain appropriate leverage parameters or support significant strategic developments or acquisitions. With our successes to date and continued focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet, we expect to be opportunistic in our investment opportunities.

Competitive Conditions
As a fully integrated commercial real estate firm, we provide in-house leasing, management, development and construction services which we believe, coupled with our significant base of commercially zoned and unencumbered land in existing business parks, should give us a competitive advantage as a real estate operator and in future development activities.
We believe that the management of real estate opportunities and risks can be done most effectively at regional or on local levels. As a result, we intend to continue our emphasis on increasing our market share, to the extent it is in markets that align with our asset strategy, and effective rents in the primary markets where we own properties. We believe that this regional focus will allow us to assess market supply and demand for real estate more effectively as well as to capitalize on the strong relationships with our tenant base. In addition, we seek to further capitalize on our many strong relationships with customers that operate on a national level. As a fully integrated real estate company, we are able to arrange for or provide to our tenants not only well located and well maintained facilities, but also the capability for build-to-suit construction, tenant finish construction, and expansion flexibility.
All of our properties are located in areas that include competitive properties. Institutional investors, other REITs or local real estate operators generally own such properties; however, no single competitor or small group of competitors is dominant in our current markets. The supply of and demand for similar available rental properties may affect the rental rates we will receive on our properties. Other competitive factors include the attractiveness of the property location, the quality of the property and tenant services provided, and the reputation of the owner and operator. 
Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance ("ESG") 
We are focused on promoting our growth in a sustainable way, one that succeeds by delivering long-term value for our stakeholders. As part of our vision to deliver sustainable excellence in logistics real estate, we have a long-standing commitment to sustainable practices in environmental, social and corporate governance initiatives. 
Environmental
We continuously look for new and better ways to minimize our environmental impact as well as that of our tenants. We are especially focused on energy consumption, water consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.
On December 17, 2019, we adopted a Sustainable Development Policy intended to increase the operational efficiency of our buildings and promote sustainable design principles. We are committed to integrating innovative, sustainable building design features in alignment with the U.S. Green Building Council® ("USGBC®") Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (or LEED®), of which we have been a member of since 2008. In April 2021, we achieved acceptance into the USGBC® volume certification program to help streamline our sustainable development process. Specifically, we invest in sustainable practices, such as water usage reduction measures, efficient lighting, high efficient HVAC and renewable energy, construction waste reduction, recycling and user well-being attributes with the goal of positively impacting the experience of our tenants and increasing the value of our assets.
We do not have access to approximately 95% of the utility usage at our properties but, for the utilities in our control, we have been partnering with a third party data management provider to help monitor and manage usage. 
Below is a chart showing our information for the applicable sustainability metrics that we monitor and report on in alignment with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board standard for real estate:

Topic | Accounting Metric | Code | Our Information 
Energy Management | Description of how building energy management considerations are integrated into property investment analysis and operational strategy | IF-RE-130a.5 | We integrate energy usage reduction measures on all new developments, incorporating LEED certification requirements and applicable aspects of our own sustainability policies/programs. These measures include energy modeling, high efficiency equipment (HVAC and lighting), and climate zone appropriate design factors. We have an ongoing lighting retrofit program, replacing outdated light fixtures with LED fixtures.
Water Management | Description of water management risks and discussion of strategies and practices to mitigate those risks | IF-RE-140a.4 | We integrate water reduction measures on all new developments and renovation, incorporating LEED water efficient credit criteria or applicable aspects of our own sustainability policies/programs. These measures include the use of WaterSense® fixtures for all domestic usage, xeriscaping to minimize or eliminate the need for irrigation, and water usage monitoring, where available and appropriate. 
Climate Change Adaptation | Area of properties located in 100-year flood zones, by property subsector | IF-RE-450a.1 | 4.5 million square feet. 

In November 2021, in an effort to mitigate and reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, we set a goal to achieve carbon neutrality for our own operations by 2025 and to achieve carbon neutrality in alignment with the Paris Climate Accords by 2040. Carbon emissions from our operations are calculated as scope 1 and 2 emissions, which are direct and indirect emissions such as purchased power to operate our Duke Realty offices. Scope 3 emissions are the largest category and include the emissions created from our upstream and downstream activities including but not limited to tenant utilities from our owned buildings, the development process, waste and company travel. We have a comprehensive strategy to meet our goals by reducing carbon emissions, replacing energy sources with renewable energy and offsetting energy consumption.
We issued two green bonds in 2021 including an issuance of $500.0 million of senior unsecured notes in November 2021 with a stated interest rate of 2.25% due January 15, 2032 and an issuance of $450.0 million of senior unsecured notes in January 2021 with a stated interest rate of 1.75% due February 1, 2031. We now hold three green bonds totaling $1.35 billion. The net proceeds from these offerings will be used to finance future or refinance recently completed “eligible green projects”. These projects may include green buildings, energy efficiency projects, sustainable water and wastewater management systems, renewable energy projects, clean transportation solutions and pollution prevention and control. Green buildings are new development, redevelopment, or acquisitions of buildings, that have or are expected to receive Certified, Silver or Gold LEED certification through a 3rd party review and validation process by USGBC’s Green Building Certification Institute. In 2021, we also added a sustainability metric to our line of credit tied to growing the percentage of our LEED® developed projects.

Social
We are committed to social responsibility by developing and maintaining strong relationships with our associates, customers, business partners, investors as well as the communities in which we operate and invest. We are committed to fair compensation and pay equity, fostering a dynamic and balanced work environment and providing associates with developmental opportunities to perform well and derive satisfaction from their work. We support and encourage our associates to participate in volunteer and community activities by providing each associate with two paid community days per year. We also have charitable contribution programs, such as our dollars for doers program (matching dollars for volunteer hours spent) and our matching gifts program (matching dollars for associates donations to charities). In addition, we partner with various charitable organizations, including the American Red Cross since 2017. Our sustainable development, energy, and resource usage policies help to create a cleaner and healthier environment for the communities we serve. In 2021, we completed a community solar project where we partnered with solar developers to install solar panels on the rooftops of several buildings we own to enable the capture of solar energy for the neighboring community. Through all of these initiatives and others, we endeavor to make a positive impact on the communities in which we conduct business.
Corporate Governance
Since our inception, we not only have strived to be a top-performer operationally, but also to lead in issues important to investors such as disclosure and corporate governance. The General Partner's system of governance reinforces this commitment and, as a limited partnership that has one general partner owning over 90% of the Partnership's common interest, the governance of the Partnership is necessarily linked to the corporate governance of the General Partner. Summarized below are the highlights of the General Partner's Corporate Governance initiatives.
