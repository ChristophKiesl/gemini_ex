Each of these assets sells substantially all of its output pursuant to long-term offtake agreements with creditworthy counterparties. The weighted average remaining contract duration of these offtake agreements was approximately 16 years as of December 31, 2016 based on CAFD. The Company also owns thermal infrastructure assets with an aggregate steam and chilled water capacity of 1,319 net MWt and electric generation capacity of 123 net MW. These thermal infrastructure assets provide steam, hot and/or chilled water, and, in some instances, electricity to commercial businesses, universities, hospitals and governmental units in multiple locations, principally through long-term contracts or pursuant to rates regulated by state utility commissions.
A complete listing of the Company's interests in facilities, operations and/or projects owned or leased as of December 31, 2016 can be found in Item 2 — Properties.
History
The Company was formed by NRG Energy, Inc., or NRG, as a Delaware corporation on December 20, 2012 and closed its initial public offering on July 22, 2013. In connection with its initial public offering, the Company's shares of Class A common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “NYLD.” 
Effective May 14, 2015, the Company completed a stock split whereby each outstanding share of Class A common stock was split into one share of Class A common stock and one share of Class C common stock, and each outstanding share of Class B common stock was split into one share of Class B common stock and one share of Class D common stock. The stock split is referred to as the Recapitalization and all references to share or per share amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and applicable disclosures have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the Recapitalization. Following the Recapitalization, the Company's Class A common stock continued trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the new ticker symbol "NYLD.A" and the Class C common stock began trading under the ticker symbol "NYLD."
NRG, through its holdings of Class B common stock and Class D common stock, has a 55.1% voting interest in the Company and receives distributions from NRG Yield LLC through its ownership of Class B units and Class D units. The holders of the Company's issued and outstanding shares of Class A common stock and Class C common stock are entitled to dividends as declared and have 44.9% of the voting power in the Company.
The Company is the sole managing member of NRG Yield LLC and operates and controls all of its business and affairs and consolidates the financial results of NRG Yield LLC and its subsidiaries. NRG Yield LLC is a holding company for the companies that directly and indirectly own and operate the Company's business. As of December 31, 2016, the Company and NRG have 53.3% and 46.7% economic interests in NRG Yield LLC, respectively. As a result of the current ownership of the Class B common stock and Class D common stock, NRG continues at the present time to control the Company, and the Company in turn, as the sole managing member of NRG Yield LLC, controls NRG Yield LLC and its subsidiaries.

The diagram below depicts the Company’s organizational structure as of December 31, 2016:

Business Strategy
The Company's primary business strategy is to focus on the acquisition and ownership of assets with predictable, long-term cash flows in order that it may be able to increase the cash dividends paid to holders of the Company's Class A and Class C common stock over time without compromising the ongoing stability of the business. The Company's plan for executing this strategy includes the following key components:
Focus on contracted renewable energy and conventional generation and thermal infrastructure assets. The Company owns and operates utility scale and distributed renewable energy and natural gas-fired generation, thermal and other infrastructure assets with proven technologies, low operating risks and stable cash flows. The Company believes by focusing on this core asset class and leveraging its industry knowledge, it will maximize its strategic opportunities, be a leader in operational efficiency and maximize its overall financial performance.
Growing the business through acquisitions of contracted operating assets.  The Company believes that its base of operations and relationship with NRG provide a platform in the conventional and renewable power generation and thermal sectors for strategic growth through cash accretive and tax advantaged acquisitions complementary to its existing portfolio. In addition to acquiring renewable generation, conventional generation and thermal infrastructure assets from third parties where the Company believes its knowledge of the market and operating expertise provides it with a competitive advantage, the Company entered into a Right of First Offer Agreement with NRG, or the ROFO Agreement. On February 24, 2017, the Company amended and restated the ROFO Agreement, expanding the NRG ROFO pipeline with the addition of 234 net MW of utility-scale solar projects, consisting of Buckthorn, a 154 net MW solar facility in Texas, and Hawaii solar projects, which have a combined capacity of 80 net MW. Under the ROFO Agreement, NRG has granted the Company and its affiliates a right of first offer on any proposed sale, transfer or other disposition of certain assets of NRG until February 24, 2022. In addition to the assets described in the table below which reflects the assets subject to sale, the ROFO Agreement also provides the Company with a right of first offer with respect to up to $250 million of equity in one or more distributed solar generation portfolios developed by affiliates of NRG, together with the assets listed in the table below, the NRG ROFO Assets.

(b) Represents 49.95% of NRG's 50.01% ownership interest in Ivanpah. Following a sale of this 49.95% interest, the remaining 50.05% of Ivanpah would be owned by NRG, Google Inc. and BrightSource Energy Inc.
(c) Represents NRG’s 51% ownership interest in Agua Caliente. The remaining 49% of Agua Caliente is owned by BHE AC Holdings, LLC. As further described below, the Company has entered into an agreement with NRG to acquire 16% of Agua Caliente.
(d) Represents NRG's remaining 25% of the Class B interests of NRG Wind TE Holdco. NRG Yield, Inc. acquired 75% of the Class B interests in November 2015. A tax equity investor owns the Class A interests in NRG Wind TE Holdco.
(e) Includes Bingham Lake, Eastridge, and Westridge projects.
NRG is not obligated to sell the remaining NRG ROFO Assets to the Company and, if offered by NRG, the Company cannot be sure whether these assets will be offered on acceptable terms, or that the Company will choose to consummate such acquisitions. In addition, NRG may offer additional assets to the Company, as described in Item 7 — Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
In December 2016, NRG offered the Company the opportunity to purchase the following assets: (i) the Minnesota Portfolio, a 40 MW portfolio of wind projects; (ii) the 30 MW Community wind project; (iii) the 50 MW Jeffers wind projects; and (iv) a 16% interest in the 290 MW Agua Caliente solar project, pursuant to the ROFO Agreement. In addition to these ROFO Assets, NRG also offered the Company the opportunity to purchase NRG's 50% interests in seven utility-scale solar projects located in Utah, representing 265 net MW of capacity, based on cash to be distributed, that were part of NRG's recent acquisition of projects from SunEdison. 
On February 24, 2017, the Company and NRG entered into a definitive agreement regarding the acquisition of the following facilities: (i) a 16% interest (approximately 31% of NRG's 51% interest) in the Agua Caliente solar farm, one of the NRG ROFO assets, representing ownership of approximately 46 net MW of capacity. Agua Caliente is located in Yuma County, AZ and sells power subject to a 25-year PPA with Pacific Gas and Electric, with 22 years remaining on that contract; and (ii) NRG's 50% interests in seven utility-scale solar farms located in Utah representing 265 net MW of capacity, based on cash to be distributed, that were part of NRG's recent acquisition of projects from SunEdison. The Utah assets achieved commercial operations in 2016, sell power subject to 20-year PPAs with PacifiCorp, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway and are part of a tax equity structure with Dominion Solar Projects III, Inc., or Dominion, from which NRG currently receives 50% of cash to be distributed. The Company expects to pay total cash consideration of $130 million for the transaction, excluding adjustments for working capital and assume non-recourse project debt of approximately $328 million, which will be consolidated, as well as its pro-rata share of non-recourse project level debt of $136 million. The Company elected not to pursue the acquisition of the Minnesota Portfolio, Community and Jeffers wind projects at this time, but may continue its evaluation of the projects. The Company has retained the right with NRG, pursuant to the ROFO Agreement, to participate in any third party process to the extent NRG elected to pursue a third party sale of these assets.

Primary focus on North America. The Company intends to primarily focus its investments in North America (including the unincorporated territories of the U.S.). The Company believes that industry fundamentals in North America present it with significant opportunity to acquire renewable, natural gas-fired generation and thermal infrastructure assets, without creating significant exposure to currency and sovereign risk. By primarily focusing its efforts on North America, the Company believes it will best leverage its regional knowledge of power markets, industry relationships and skill sets to maximize the performance of the Company.
Maintain sound financial practices to grow the dividend. The Company intends to maintain a commitment to disciplined financial analysis and a balanced capital structure to enable it to increase its quarterly dividend over time and serve the long-term interests of its stockholders. The Company's financial practices include a risk and credit policy focused on transacting with credit-worthy counterparties; a financing policy, which focuses on seeking an optimal capital structure through various capital formation alternatives to minimize interest rate and refinancing risks, ensure stable long-term dividends and maximize value; and a dividend policy that is based on distributing a significant portion of CAFD each quarter that the Company receives from NRG Yield LLC, subject to available capital, market conditions, and compliance with associated laws, regulations and other contractual obligations. The Company intends to evaluate various alternatives for financing future acquisitions and refinancing of existing project-level debt, in each case, to reduce the cost of debt, extend maturities and maximize CAFD. The Company believes it has additional flexibility to seek alternative financing arrangements, including, but not limited to, debt financings and equity-like instruments.
Competition
Power generation is a capital-intensive business with numerous and diverse industry participants. The Company competes on the basis of the location of its plants and on the basis of contract price and terms of individual projects. Within the power industry, there is a wide variation in terms of the capabilities, resources, nature and identity of the companies with whom the Company competes with depending on the market. Competitors for energy supply are utilities, independent power producers and other providers of distributed generation. The Company also competes to acquire new projects with renewable developers who retain renewable power plant ownership, independent power producers, financial investors and other dividend, growth-oriented companies. Competitive conditions may be substantially affected by capital market conditions and by various forms of energy legislation and regulation considered by federal, state and local legislatures and administrative agencies, including tax policy. Such laws and regulations may substantially increase the costs of acquiring, constructing and operating projects, and it could be difficult for the Company to adapt to and operate under such laws and regulations.
The Company's thermal business has certain cost efficiencies that may form barriers to entry. Generally, there is only one district energy system in a given territory, for which the only competition comes from on-site systems. While the district energy system can usually make an effective case for the efficiency of its services, some building owners nonetheless may opt for on-site systems, either due to corporate policies regarding allocation of capital, unique situations where an on-site system might in fact prove more efficient, or because of previously committed capital in systems that are already on-site. Growth in existing district energy systems generally comes from new building construction or existing building conversions within the service territory of the district energy provider.
Competitive Strengths
Stable, high quality cash flows. The Company's facilities have a highly stable, predictable cash flow profile consisting of predominantly long-life electric generation assets that sell electricity under long-term fixed priced contracts or pursuant to regulated rates with investment grade and certain other credit-worthy counterparties. Additionally, the Company's facilities have minimal fuel risk. For the Company's conventional assets, fuel is provided by the toll counterparty or the cost thereof is a pass-through cost under the CfD. Renewable facilities have no fuel costs, and most of the Company's thermal infrastructure assets have contractual or regulatory tariff mechanisms for fuel cost recovery. The offtake agreements for the Company's conventional and renewable generation facilities have a weighted-average remaining duration of approximately 16 years as of December 31, 2016, based on CAFD, providing long-term cash flow stability. The Company's generation offtake agreements with counterparties for whom credit ratings are available have a weighted-average Moody’s rating of A3 based on rated capacity under contract. All of the Company's assets are in the U.S. and accordingly have no currency or repatriation risks. 
High quality, long-lived assets with low operating and capital requirements.  The Company benefits from a portfolio of relatively newly-constructed assets, other than thermal infrastructure assets. The Company's assets are comprised of proven and reliable technologies, provided by leading original solar and wind equipment manufacturers such as General Electric, Siemens AG, SunPower Corporation, or SunPower, First Solar Inc., or First Solar, Vestas, Suzlon and Mitsubishi. Given the modern nature of the portfolio, which includes a substantial number of relatively low operating and maintenance cost solar and wind generation assets, the Company expects to achieve high fleet availability and expend modest maintenance-related capital expenditures. Additionally, with the support of services provided by NRG, the Company expects to continue to implement the same rigorous preventative operating and management practices that NRG uses across its fleet of assets.

Significant scale and diversity. The Company owns and operates a large and diverse portfolio of contracted electric generation and thermal infrastructure assets. As of December 31, 2016, the Company's 4,563 net MW contracted generation portfolio benefits from significant diversification in terms of technology, fuel type, counterparty and geography. The Company's thermal business consists of twelve operations, seven of which are district energy centers that provide steam and chilled water to approximately 705 customers, and five of which provide generation. The Company believes its scale and access to best practices across the fleet improves its business development opportunities through enhanced industry relationships, reputation and understanding of regional power market dynamics. Furthermore, the Company's diversification reduces its operating risk profile and reliance on any single market.
Relationship with NRG. The Company believes its relationship with NRG, including NRG’s expressed intention to maintain a controlling interest in the Company, provides significant benefits to the Company, including:
• Management and Operational Expertise. The Company has access to the significant resources of NRG, the largest competitive power generator in the U.S., to support its operational, financial, legal, regulatory and environmental functions. 
• Development and Acquisition Track Record. NRG's development and strategic teams are focused on the development and acquisition of renewable and conventional generation assets, which may provide future growth opportunities for the Company in addition to the assets set forth in the ROFO Agreement.  The Company believes NRG’s ownership position in the Company incentivizes NRG to support the Company's growth strategy, including through the development of renewable and conventional generation projects.  During 2016, NRG acquired 1,639 MWs of utility scale solar and wind projects and 107 MWs of distributed generation and community solar projects that are currently under development or in operation.  
• Financing Expertise. The Company, with the support of NRG, has been able to achieve a successful track record of sourcing attractive low-cost, long duration capital to fund acquisitions.  The Company expects to continue to realize benefits from NRG’s financing and structuring expertise as well as its relationships with financial institutions and other lenders.
Environmentally well-positioned portfolio of assets. The Company's portfolio of electric generation assets consists of 2,618 net MW of renewable generation capacity that are non-emitting sources of power generation. The Company's conventional assets consist of the dual fuel-fired GenConn assets as well as the Marsh Landing and Walnut Creek simple cycle natural gas-fired peaking generation facilities and the El Segundo combined cycle natural gas-fired peaking facility. The Company does not anticipate having to expend any significant capital expenditures in the foreseeable future to comply with current environmental regulations applicable to its generation assets. Taken as a whole, the Company believes its strategy will be a net beneficiary of current and potential environmental legislation and regulatory requirements that may serve as a catalyst for capacity retirements and improve market opportunities for environmentally well-positioned assets like the Company's assets once its current offtake agreements expire.
Thermal infrastructure business has high entry costs. Significant capital has been invested to construct the Company's thermal infrastructure assets, serving as a barrier to entry in the markets in which such assets operate. As of December 31, 2016, the Company's thermal gross property, plant, and equipment was approximately $467 million. The Company's thermal district energy centers are located in urban city areas, with the chilled water and steam delivery systems located underground. Constructing underground delivery systems in urban areas requires long lead times for permitting, rights of way and inspections and is costly. By contrast, the incremental cost to add new customers in existing markets is relatively low. Once thermal infrastructure is established, the Company believes it has the ability to retain customers over long periods of time and to compete effectively for additional business against stand-alone on-site heating and cooling generation facilities. Installation of stand-alone equipment can require significant modification to a building as well as significant space for equipment and funding for capital expenditures. The Company's system technologies often provide economies of scale in terms of fuel procurement, ability to switch between multiple types of fuel to generate thermal energy, and fuel conversion efficiency.

Segment Review
The following tables summarize the Company's operating revenues, net income (loss) and assets by segment for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, as discussed in Item 15 — Note 13, Segment Reporting, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer to that footnote for additional information about the Company's segments. In addition, refer to Item 2 — Properties, for information about the facilities in each of the Company's segments. All amounts have been recast to include the effect of the acquisitions of the Drop Down Assets, which were accounted for as transfers of entities under common control. The accounting guidance requires retrospective combination of the entities for all periods presented as if the combination has been in effect since the inception of common control. Accordingly, the Company prepared its consolidated financial statements to reflect the transfers as if they had taken place from the beginning of the financial statements period or from the date the entities were under common control (if later than the beginning of the financial statements period).

Government Incentives
Government incentives, including PTCs and ITCs, can enhance the economics of the Company's generating assets and investments by providing, for example, loan guarantees, cash grants, favorable tax treatment, favorable depreciation rules or other incentives. The Company cannot predict the effects that the new U.S. presidential administration will have on government incentives. 
Regulatory Matters 
As owners of power plants and participants in wholesale and thermal energy markets, certain of the Company's subsidiaries are subject to regulation by various federal and state government agencies. These agencies include FERC and the PUCT, as well as other public utility commissions in certain states where the Company's assets are located. Each of the Company's U.S. generating facilities qualifies as an EWG or QF. In addition, the Company is subject to the market rules, procedures and protocols of the various ISO and RTO markets in which it participates. Likewise, the Company must also comply with the mandatory reliability requirements imposed by NERC and the regional reliability entities in the regions where the Company operates. The Company's operations within the ERCOT footprint are not subject to rate regulation by FERC, as they are deemed to operate solely within the ERCOT market and not in interstate commerce. These operations are subject to regulation by PUCT.
CFTC
The CFTC, among other things, regulates the trading of swaps, futures and many commodities under the Commodity Exchange Act, or CEA. Since 2010, there have been a number of reforms to the regulation of the derivatives markets. These regulations, and any further changes thereto, or adoption of additional regulations, including any regulations relating to position limits on futures and other derivatives or margin for derivatives, could negatively impact the Company’s ability to hedge its portfolio in an efficient, cost-effective manner by, among other things, potentially decreasing liquidity in the forward commodity and derivatives markets or limiting the Company’s ability to utilize non-cash collateral for derivatives transactions.
 11



FERC
FERC, among other things, regulates the transmission and the wholesale sale of electricity in interstate commerce under the authority of the FPA. The transmission of electric energy occurring wholly within ERCOT is not subject to FERC’s jurisdiction under Sections 203 or 205 of the FPA. Under existing regulations, FERC determines whether an entity owning a generation facility is an EWG, as defined in the PUHCA. FERC also determines whether a generation facility meets the ownership and technical criteria of a QF under the PURPA. Each of the Company’s non-ERCOT generating facilities qualifies as an EWG.
The FPA gives FERC exclusive rate-making jurisdiction over the wholesale sale of electricity and transmission of electricity in interstate commerce of public utilities (as defined by the FPA). Under the FPA, FERC, with certain exceptions, regulates the owners of facilities used for the wholesale sale of electricity or transmission in interstate commerce as public utilities, and establishes market rules that are just and reasonable.
Public utilities are required to obtain FERC’s acceptance, pursuant to Section 205 of the FPA, of their rate schedules for the wholesale sale of electricity. All of the Company’s non-QF generating entities located outside of ERCOT make sales of electricity pursuant to market-based rates, as opposed to traditional cost-of-service regulated rates. Every three years FERC will conduct a review of the Company’s market based rates and potential market power on a regional basis.
In accordance with the Energy Policy Act of 2005, FERC has approved the NERC as the national Energy Reliability Organization, or ERO. As the ERO, NERC is responsible for the development and enforcement of mandatory reliability standards for the wholesale electric power system. In addition to complying with NERC requirements, each entity must comply with the requirements of the regional reliability entity for the region in which it is located.
The PURPA was passed in 1978 in large part to promote increased energy efficiency and development of independent power producers. The PURPA created QFs to further both goals, and FERC is primarily charged with administering the PURPA as it applies to QFs. Certain QFs are exempt from regulation, either in whole or in part, under the FPA as public utilities.
The PUHCA provides FERC with certain authority over and access to books and records of public utility holding companies not otherwise exempt by virtue of their ownership of EWGs, QFs, and Foreign Utility Companies. The Company is exempt from many of the accounting, record retention, and reporting requirements of the PUHCA.
Environmental Matters 
The Company is subject to a wide range of environmental laws in the development, construction, ownership and operation of projects. These laws generally require that governmental permits and approvals be obtained before construction and during operation of facilities. The Company is also subject to laws regarding the protection of wildlife, including migratory birds, eagles, threatened and endangered species. Federal and state environmental laws have become more stringent over time, although this trend could change in the near term with respect to federal laws under the new U.S. presidential administration.
In October 2015, the EPA finalized the Clean Power Plan, or CPP, addressing GHG emissions from existing EGUs. On February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the CPP. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, sitting en banc, heard oral argument on the legal challenges to the CPP in September 2016. Due to the ongoing litigation and the potential impact of the new U.S. presidential administration, the Company believes the CPP is not likely to survive. 
Customers 
The Company sells its electricity and environmental attributes, including RECs, primarily to local utilities under long-term, fixed-price PPAs. During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company derived approximately 42% of its consolidated revenue from Southern California Edison, or SCE, and approximately 23% of its consolidated revenue from Pacific Gas and Electric, or PG&E.
 12



Employees
The Company employs Christopher Sotos as its President and Chief Executive Officer and Chad Plotkin as its Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Other than Messrs. Sotos and Plotkin, the Company does not employ any other employees. The personnel that manage operations of the Company are employees of NRG or third parties managed by NRG, and their services are provided for the Company's benefit under the Management Services Agreement and project operations and maintenance agreements with NRG as described in Item 15 — Note 15, Related Party Transactions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Available Information
The Company's annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act are available free of charge through the Company's website, www.nrgyield.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.
