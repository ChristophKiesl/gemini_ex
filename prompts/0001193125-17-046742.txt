Item 1. Business 
Overview 
 Our company provides a technology platform for ad buyers. 
 With our self-serve platform, ad buyers are able to share their customized messages and ideas with the people and in the context they deliberately choose. 
 Our mission is to help our clients compete in the marketplace of ideasthe place in media and public discourse where ideas and messages compete in the open market for the mindshare of men and women around the world. Since most traditional and digital media is primarily monetized with advertising, ads are the currency of media and the Internet, and therefore at the center of the marketplace of ideas. 
 Our platform makes media monetization more effective. Instead of disrupting the foundation of media and advertising, we enable it. By offering compelling improvements in effectiveness, efficiency and reporting, we aim to change media and advertising globally. 
 Our platform makes it possible to message specific ideas to specific people. We give advertisers of all sizes the power to have simultaneous 1-to-1 customized interactions with billions of people around the world. Most advertising dollars are spent on awareness, where a brand pushes new information and ideas to a broad audience. Conversely, search engines respond to specific requests from individuals for information. Our technology combines the best of both, making it possible to push out a precise idea or message to a targeted audience with global scale. 
 Founded by some of the pioneers of the programmatic ad market, we established our company in 2009 with the intent to make advertising better by deploying massive amounts of data. By providing ad buyers with tools to leverage their first-party data as well as third-party data, we aim to provide a higher return on every advertising dollar spent. While our technology platform is deployed to directly serve ad buyers, the entire advertising marketplace benefitspublishers and content creators can experience a higher yield on their inventory, while consumers can receive advertising that is more relevant and interesting to them. 
 We believe that an average consumer might be exposed to over one thousand digital advertisements on a typical day. Most consumers are unaware that when they land on a webpage, watch a video, use a mobile app or watch an Internet-connected TV, there is often an auction for advertising inventory being run in about 1/10th of one second behind the scenes as the content loads. Our platform provides access to approximately 4.7 million ad spots on average every second for our clients to bid on across millions of different scaled media sourceswebsites, shows, channels, stations and streams. Our technology makes it possible for ad buyers to compete in those real-time auctions. Our platform helps our clients determine what ad will display and what price they should pay for every ad opportunity a buyer can consider. 
 In 2016, approximately $651.7 billion was spent on global advertising (including approximately $225.4 billion on TV advertising and approximately $54.6 billion on display advertising), according to International Data Corporation, or IDC, and in 2016, approximately $19 billion was transacted in the programmatic advertising spot market via real-time marketplaces, according to Magna Global. We aim to power every agent of every advertiser in both the spot and forward markets, including upfront purchases, for programmatic advertising. 
 We also believe that the efficiency of programmatic advertising will lead to a greater percentage of every advertising dollar ending up in the pocket of publishers. Publishers can now generate revenue without the large sales forces that were required in the past. Higher revenue yields and lower operating costs make it possible for publishers to increase their investment in creating high quality content.

Programmatic advertising is currently a small portion of total global advertising spend. Largely because of the price discovery benefits, we believe eventually the vast majority of advertising will be transacted programmatically. 
 We power advertising for many of the worlds biggest brands, across industry sectors. But beyond just selling more products, our platform has been used to promote a wide variety of ideas and messages. For this reason, we believe programmatic ads are important to the future of journalism. 
 Similarly, many non-profits run their precious advertising budgets through our platform so that their agents can carefully and deliberately spend their often modest budgets wisely. Small businesses often have small target audiences and tight budgets, and selecting ads carefully can regularly benefit them more than even bigger companies. We also have ongoing agreements with agencies that power media for both Republican and Democratic campaigns to win elections and shape public opinion. By making it possible to share a different message with different voters and constituents, we make it possible to elevate the discourse in the global marketplace of ideas. We believe that instead of platitudes that are too common when communicating with a general audience, substantive 1-to-1 conversations require a more meaningful messageregardless of whether one is selling a product, raising money for a cause or sharing a political message. 
 We enable the programmatic marketplace with our self-serve platform. The unique architecture of our platform allows users access to highly granular targeting and reporting options, which we refer to as expressiveness. When combined with our data management capability and first-party data, our clients can reach their highly specified audiences with customized messages and generate favorable campaign outcomes. 
 By using our technology and the reach of the Internet, we can power this data-driven 1-to-1 messaging with massive global scale. We believe in order to do this effectively, we have to be a buy-side only platform across a spectrum of media, which we refer to as omnichannel. As the biggest brands desire to communicate with consumers worldwide, we have to be global, which is why we have employees and offices around the world. 
 Our company has had very few employees or clients ever leave the company. We believe this is a commentary on our technology, but this is especially a commentary on our culture and vision. 
 Our business and our culture is anchored on four core principles: 
 

 | No company can effect global change without passionate forward-thinking people as both employees and clients.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | By preserving an honest and transparent culture and avoiding client conflict, we can exert exponentially less effort to grow our business.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | We have committed to our clients and employees that we will never stop innovating.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Being profitable and changing the world can co-exist and is more likely to happen when striving for both simultaneously.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe we attract smart employees to our company and sophisticated ad buyers to our platform in large part because of our vision and unwavering commitment to empower the buy-side of advertising. We had $435,000 in 2016 revenue per employee at December 31, 2016, which we believe to be among the highest in the advertising technology industry. Our client retention rate on a year over-year-basis was over 95% for 2015 and 2016. 
 We derive nearly all of our gross spend and revenue from ongoing master service agreements that give users constant access to our platform, instead of insertion orders, which typically are one-off deals to run single campaigns. 
 We have grown faster than the programmatic market and have achieved significant revenue scale with $1.0 billion in gross spend in 2016. Our revenue was $202.9 million in 2016, representing a growth rate of 78% over $113.8 million in 2015, while programmatic advertising spend in the industry grew to $19 billion in 2016, according to Magna Global, representing a growth rate of over 27% from 2015.

We generated net income of $15.9 million in 2015 and $20.5 million in 2016. We generated Adjusted EBITDA of $39.2 million in 2015 and $65.2 million in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA is a financial measure not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. For a definition of Adjusted EBITDA, an explanation of our managements use of this measure and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, see footnote 3 in the section captioned Item 6. Selected Financial Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For additional financial information, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

 Our Industry 
 Since the introduction of ad-funded television in the middle of the 20th century and continuing through the present day, most advertising inventory has been transacted based on a rate card. Publishers, content owners, and their agents set a price for their inventory, and buyers place an order to purchase that inventory. Similar to how the equities and commodities markets have transitioned from paper transactions on trading floors to electronic trading, advertising is transitioning from manual to programmatic. 
 Several trends, happening in parallel, are revolutionizing the way that advertising is bought and sold. The rise of the Internet has led to a wholesale change in the way that media is consumed and monetized, as ads can be digitally delivered on a 1-to-1 basis. In traditional methods of advertising, such as broadcast TV, ads can target a specific network, program or geography, but not a single household or individual as digital ads can. 
 Some of the key industry trends are: 
 Media is Becoming Digital. Media is increasingly becoming digital as a result of advances in technology and changes in consumer behavior. This shift has enabled unprecedented options for advertisers to target and measure their advertising campaigns across nearly every media channel and device. The digital advertising market is a significant and growing part of the total advertising market. According to IDC, global advertising spend was approximately $651.7 billion in 2016 and is expected to grow to $767.1 billion in 2020, a compound annual growth rate of 4.2%. Also according to IDC, global digital advertising spend was $205.4 billion in 2016 and is expected to grow to $339.9 billion in 2020, a compound annual growth rate of 13.4%. We believe that the market is evolving and that advertisers will shift more spend to digital media. Since media is becoming increasingly digital, decisions based on consumer and behavioral data are more prevalent. 
 Fragmentation of Audience. As digital media grows, audience fragmentation is accelerating. A growing long tail of websites and content presents a challenge for advertisers trying to reach a large audience. Audience fragmentation has substantially impacted TV content distribution, perhaps more than any other channel, which we believe is setting up a significant change in how TV advertising inventory is monetized. Mirroring the fragmentation occurring in content, the number of devices used by individual consumers has increased. Both of these fragmentation trends are opportunities for technology companies that can consolidate and simplify media buying options for advertisers and their agencies. 
 Shift to Programmatic Advertising. We believe that the advertising industry is in the early stages of a shift to programmatic advertising, which is the ability to buy and sell advertising inventory electronically. Initially available for digital display advertising and transacted through real-time bidding platforms, programmatic advertising has evolved and is increasingly being used to transact across a wide range of advertising inventory, including display, mobile, video and audio among other inventory types, including TV. 
 We believe that TV advertising is just beginning its transition to programmatic. According to IDC research sponsored by our company, programmatic TV advertising spend is projected to grow from $239.8 million in 2015 to $17.3 billion in 2019. 
 
6 
 
Automation of Ad Buying. The growing complexity of digital advertising has increased the need for automation. Technology that enables fast, accurate and cost-effective decision-making through the application of computer algorithms that use extensive data sets has become critical for the success of digital advertising campaigns. Using programmatic inventory buying tools, advertisers are able to automate their campaigns, providing them with better price discovery, on an impression by impression basis. As a result, advertisers are able to purchase the advertising inventory they value the most, pay less for advertising inventory they do not value as much, and abstain from buying advertising inventory that does not fit their campaign parameters. Most of the growth in programmatic advertising to date has been driven by transactions on spot markets on advertising exchanges. Forward advertising markets and upfront purchases, which have traditionally been delivered manually, are also beginning to be handled programmatically. 
 Increased Use of Data. Advances in software and hardware and the growing use of the Internet have made it possible to collect and rapidly process massive amounts of user data. Data vendors are able to collect user information across a wide range of Internet properties and connected devices, aggregate it and combine it with other data sources. This data is then made non-identifiable and available within seconds based on specific parameters and attributes. Advertisers can integrate this targeting data with their own or an agencys proprietary data relating to client attributes, the advertisers own store locations and other related characteristics. Through the use of these data sources, together with real-time feedback on consumer reactions to the ads, programmatic advertising increases the value of impressions for advertisers, inventory owners and viewers who receive more relevant ads. 
 Ability to Target Advertising. In the past, an agency managing a campaign for a mens basketball shoe brand would typically buy TV time slots during sporting events and buy an ad on a high-traffic website for the entire March Madness basketball tournament. In contrast, by using programmatic technology, the advertisers agent can have more control and be more deliberate about where they advertise the shoes. Not every single consumer watching the March Madness tournament is interested in mens basketball shoes. So rather than paying the same price for every ad impression and every consumer, the advertiser and agent can more deliberately target the precise audience they want to reach. For instance, they can: 
 

 | advertise more often to people who frequently visit basketball websites;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | show more ads to consumers who recently visited the brands site;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


 | avoid showing ads to consumers who already purchased the shoes;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


 | spend more budget on men than women;
--+-------------------------------------


 | assign value to ads at the top of the webpage versus the bottom of the webpage;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | find the relative value of digital ads versus audio ads versus video ads; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | adjust budgets, bids and ultimately spend based on vast insights and billions of combinations of data elements.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Driven by these industry trends, programmatic advertising is expected to grow from $19 billion during 2016 to $42 billion by 2020, according to Magna Global. We believe that programmatic advertising will continue to grow as more content providers, content distributors and advertisers are able to realize its benefits. In addition, we expect that programmatic advertising will help grow the overall advertising market by enabling more advertisers to deploy more spend across a broader range of inventory channels. 
 Our industry continues to evolve. Recently, publishers of media content have increasingly been implementing the use of header bidding, a process in which advertising inventory that would have previously been sold to a certain set of buyers based on previously agreed prices and using a specific selling order is instead competitively bid across a variety of potential buyers, creating more choice for all buyers while potentially helping publishers increase their revenue. 
 By creating a more transparent marketplace for inventory, header bidding can have the effect of intensifying competition for intermediaries who are both buyers and sellers of advertising inventory. In addition, we believe 
 
7 
 
 that in recent years header bidding has contributed to higher average clearing prices for programmatically sold inventory, while also creating more price disparity between various inventory. We believe that we are well positioned to compete in an environment of increased header bidding as it enables us to have access to more inventory, which in turn may help us deliver better results for our clients. In addition, because of our advertiser focused business model, we are not subject to some of the challenges and conflicts that may arise for intermediaries who are both buyers and sellers of inventory, when competing in a transparent and competitive marketplace. Because our revenues are derived primarily from our platform fee, which is a percentage of purchases through our platform, we believe that we may benefit to the extent that header bidding results in higher prices for advertising, particularly as compared to other industry participants that generate their revenues from an arbitrage model whereby they seek to buy advertising inventory at low prices and resell it at higher prices. 
 Digital Advertising Eco-System
The digital advertising eco-system is divided into buyers, sellers and marketplaces, which can be further segmented on the basis of whether participants provide services or technology. We believe that participants on the buy-side or sell-side should be advocates for their buyers or sellers, while those in the market business should be more of a referee or have market-driven incentives to protect or enhance the integrity of the marketplace. 
 

Publishers and Their Agents. Publishers typically rely on advertising income as a key driver for their businesses. Because of the growing scale of digital advertising, publishers have increasingly adopted advanced technologies and tools that help them maximize the yield on their advertising inventory. Traditionally, many publishers used various tools and channels to sell their inventory, ranging from direct sales teams that tend to focus on their most sought-after inventory, to programmatic vendors that help them sell the rest of their inventory. Publishers are increasingly leveraging the benefits of programmatic technology through third-party agents, such as sell-side platforms, in order to achieve better yield through their own sales teams, as well as from new demand that comes to them from programmatic marketplaces. 
 Marketplaces, Exchanges and Transaction Enablers. Similar to the electronic communication networks that became part of stock exchanges, many companies are trying to create and preserve a fair and neutral marketplace for the buying and selling of ads. In addition, there are companies similar to rating agencies that evaluate advertising inventory and thus facilitate transactions. This ecosystem includes companies offering data and data management tools, independent measurement tools and quality assurance and verification products. 
 Advertisers and Their Agents. As Internet usage has increased, so has the fragmentation of audiences across websites, apps and devices. We believe the digital advertising ecosystem is more complex than ever. We also believe that as markets become more complex, the benefits of programmatic transactions become greater, similar to equities and commodities markets. Electronic transactions allow for more powerful decision making. While programmatic transactions allow buyers and sellers to deal with current market complexities, they also introduce new ones. We believe advertising marketplaces will continue to get more complex as buyers and sellers mature. As a result, the need for advertisers to have true advocates is greater than ever. Agencies and service providers are a critical element of the advertising industry, providing advertisers the advice and help that they need as they 
 
8 
 
 tackle a complex and often challenging media landscape. We believe that the scale of their operations, which employ hundreds of thousands of people, is a testament to the fact that advertising is an inherently service oriented industrywhere the agencies are, and will continue to be, the key gatekeepers for advertising budgets. 
 We believe that there are inherent conflicts of interest as some market participants serve both buyers and sellers. 
 What We Do 
 We are a technology company that empowers advertising agencies to purchase advertising more efficiently and effectively. We provide an intuitive self-serve platform that enables our clients to manage data-driven, digital advertising campaigns using their own teams. 
 

 | We Are an Enabler, Not a Disruptor. With our self-serve platform, we enable advertising agencies and service providers. We do not compete with our clients by selling our platform directly to their advertisers. Advertisers can benefit from a comprehensive solution that combines our technology platform with the services provided by advertising agencies. Our self-service technology platform provides control to our clients and gives us the benefits of a highly scalable business model. In addition to advertising agencies, our platform is used by other demand-side service providers as part of their service offerings.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | We Are Exclusively Focused on the Buy-Side. We focus on buyers since they control the advertising budgets. Also, the supply of digital advertising inventory exceeds demand, and accordingly we believe it is a buyers market. We also believe that by aligning our business only with buyers, we are able to avoid inherent conflicts of interest that exist when serving both the buy- and sell-side. This focus allows us to build trust with clients, many of whom incorporate their proprietary data into our platform. That trust and ability to use their own data on our platform, without worrying about it being used by other participants, enables our clients and their advertisers to achieve better results. This trust provides us the benefit of long-term and stable relationships with our clients.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | We Are Data-Driven. Our technology platform was founded on the principle that data-driven decisions would be the future of advertising. We built a data management platform first, before building our ad buying technology. While data from disparate third-party data providers can improve campaign performance, our clients success often relies largely on our ability to ingest first-party data from brands and their agencies to enable intelligent decisioning that optimizes advertising campaigns. Given our independent, non-conflicted buy-side focused approach and our strict protocol of carefully earmarking all client first-party data we ingest onto our data management platform, our clients trust us with their most granular and expressive data. Our technology platform enables the effective use of this granular data, which allows our clients to run more effective and precisely targeted advertising campaigns that maximize their return on advertising investment. Additionally, we are able to better optimize campaigns by using the data streams that we capture across different devices, such as phones, TVs and computers, so that data from one channel can be used to inform another. We believe that competitors that focus on only one channel such as video advertising do not benefit from the insights that come from having access to the behavior of users across the Internet. We believe that by being omnichannel, our platform has a data advantage over competitors that are channel specific.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | We Do Not Arbitrage Advertising Inventory. To further align our interests with those of our clients, we do not buy advertising inventory in order to resell it to our clients for a profit. Instead, we provide our clients with a technology platform that allows them to manage their omnichannel advertising campaigns, on a self-serve basis and with full transparency. Using our platform, our clients control their campaign spend and are able to access and choose from over 55 inventory sources. We derive substantially all of our revenue from ongoing master service agreements with our clients rather than episodic insertion orders. We believe that this approach helps us strengthen our relationships with our clients and grow their use of our platform.

 | We Are a Clear Box, Not a Black Box. Our platform is transparent and shows our clients their costs of advertising inventory, data, our platform fee and detailed performance metrics on their advertising campaigns. Our clients directly access and execute campaigns on our platform, control all facets of inventory purchasing decisions, and receive detailed, real-time reporting on all their advertising campaigns. By providing transparent information on our platform, our clients are able to continually compare results and target their budgets to the most effective advertising inventory, data providers and channels.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | We Are an Open Platform. Clients can customize and build their own features on top of our platform. Clients may use our application programming interfaces, or APIs, to, for example, design their own user interface, bulk manage advertising campaigns, and link other systems including ad servers or reporting tools. As of December 31, 2016, all of our top 10 clients used our APIs and nearly half of our clients have integrated with our APIs. Using our APIs or by working with our engineering team, clients are able to build their own proprietary tools in areas including reporting, campaign strategy, custom algorithms or proprietary data use cases. Our open platform approach enables clients to integrate with our technology, which we believe leads to long-term relationships and increased use of our platform.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | We Are Omnichannel. Our platform enables our clients to deliver unified advertising campaigns across multiple devices, including computers, smartphones, tablets, gaming consoles, digital TV and broadcast TV. We also support multiple formats, including display, video, broadcast TV, Internet-connected TV, mobile web, in-app mobile and native. The breadth of data that we collect from a multitude of data sources across all channels gives our clients a holistic view of audiences, enabling more effective targeting across different channels.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Strengths 
 We believe the following attributes and capabilities form our core strengths and provide us with competitive advantages: 
 

 | Expressiveness of Our Platform. Our platform allows clients to easily define and manage advertising campaigns with multiple targeting parameters that may result in quadrillions of permutations, which we refer to as expressiveness. We believe that expressiveness provides clients with the ability to target audiences with an extremely high level of precision and thus obtain higher returns on their advertising spend.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Scalable Self-Service Model. We offer a self-service model that lets clients direct their own purchases of advertising inventory without extensive involvement by our personnel. This model helps us scale efficiently and has allowed us to grow our business at a faster pace than the growth of our sales and support organization.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Loyal Client Base. We had approximately 566 clients, including the advertising industrys largest agencies, as of December 31, 2016. Many of our clients use our platform regularly as part of their digital advertising purchase workflow, creating ongoing relationships. As a result, our clients are loyal, with over 95% client retention during 2015 and 2016. In addition, our clients typically grow their use of our platform over time, with our clients who spent with us in 2015 increasing their spend on our platform by 71% during 2016.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Extensive Data Access. Our clients can easily buy targeting data from over 105 sources through our platform. We also provide clients access to our proprietary data, which increases with continued use of our platform. We believe that the integration of data and decisioning within a single platform enables us to better serve our clients.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Focus on Innovation. Our focus on innovation enables us to enhance our platform rapidly for our clients in a constantly evolving industry. We have designed the technology for our platform to enable us to develop new features and make changes quickly and efficiently. For example, we enhanced our platform with 47 releases of updated features and increased functionality in 2016.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
10 
 

 | Scaled and Profitable Business Model. We have grown our business rapidly while achieving profitability, demonstrating the power of our platform, the strength of our client relationships and the leverage inherent to our business model. During 2016, gross spend was $1.0 billion, helping us generate $202.9 million in revenue, up 78% from 2015. In 2016, our net income was $20.5 million and our Adjusted EBITDA increased by 67% to $65.2 million. See footnote 3 in the section captioned Item 6. Selected Financial Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Growth Strategy 
 The key elements of our long-term growth strategy include: 
 

 | Increase Our Share of Existing Clients Digital Advertising Spend. Many advertisers are moving a greater percentage of their advertising budgets to programmatic channels. We believe that this shift will provide us with the opportunity to capture a larger share of the overall advertising spend by our existing clients. Additionally, we plan to promote additional services and data to our clients, helping us grow our business.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Grow Our Client Base. We have extensive relationships with many advertising agencies and service providers, and believe that, given the decentralized nature of the advertising industry, we have the opportunity to expand our relationships within these agencies and with additional agencies, as well as new service providers. We expect to continue making investments in growing our sales and client service team to support this strategy.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Expand Our Omnichannel Capabilities. We believe offering clients capabilities across all media channels and devices enables advertisers to manage omnichannel campaigns and use data from each channel to inform decisions in other channels. We believe these capabilities will continue to further strengthen our relationships with our clients. We intend to continue to invest in innovation across all channels, including the integration of new inventory sources within digital radio, social, native and television. We believe that television and digital radio, in particular, present significant market opportunities.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Extend Our Reach to TV. TV is the largest category of advertising spend, and is transitioning to programmatic buying and selling. We believe that the future of TV is in streaming media and video on demand, as streaming TV subscription services are increasingly available at a fraction of the cost of traditional pay TV subscriptions. We intend to leverage our existing market position and technology platform to accelerate this transition. We plan to invest significant resources in technology, sales and support staff related to our TV growth initiatives.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Continue to Innovate in Technology and Data. We intend to continue to innovate in technology to improve our platform and enhance its features and functionalities. We view data as one of our key competitive advantages. We will continue to invest resources in growing our data offerings, both from third-party providers as well as our proprietary data.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Expand Our International Presence. Many of our clients serve advertisers on a global basis and we intend to expand our presence outside of the United States to serve the needs of those advertisers in additional geographies. As we expand relationships with our existing clients, we are investing in select regions in Europe and Asia. In particular, we believe that China and Indonesia may represent substantial growth opportunities and we are investing in developing our business in those markets.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Platform 
 Our platform enables a media planner or buyer at an advertising agency to: 
 

 | purchase digital media programmatically on various media exchanges and sell-side platforms;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | acquire and use third-party data to optimize and measure digital advertising campaigns;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | deploy their, or their clients, own first-party data in order to optimize campaign efficacy;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
11 
 

 | monitor and manage ongoing digital advertising campaigns on a real-time basis;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | link digital campaigns to offline sales results or other business objectives;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | access other services such as our data management platform and publisher management platform marketplace; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | use our user interface and APIs to build their own proprietary technology on top of our platform.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 At the core of our platform is our bid-factor based architecture, which we believe has advantages over line-item based architectures that other buy-side systems use. With a line-item based system, ad buyers need to identify the relevant individual audience characteristics, such as age, gender and location, and assign a bid value and budget for each targeted characteristic, and then choose their targeting data. A line-item based system then computes a potential set of advertising purchases and caches the results ahead of time. The system will subsequently compare the cached results to available inventory and make bids. This architecture limits the number of factors that an ad buyer can use to target, given the manual nature of the process and the memory required to cache all the possible combinations. Additionally, in order to maintain the fast response rates required to participate in real-time auctions, line-item based bidders often use predictive analytics to evaluate impressions, making them less precise and efficient. 
 In contrast, our bid-factor based system allows users to define desirable factors and the value associated with those factors. Based on these factors, our platform can compute in real-time the value of impressions and bid only for optimal impressions. Because of the granularity of the bid factors, users of our platform can rapidly create billions of different bid permutations with only a few clicks. This expressiveness enables better targeting, pricing and campaign results. 
 Our platform is useful and user-friendly based on the following: 
 

 | Easy to Use, Open and Customizable. Our platform provides multiple, easy-to-use automation tools that help our users focus on managing the key factors affecting their campaigns. Our platform also enables clients to integrate custom features and interfaces for their own use through our APIs.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Expressive. Our platform enables users to easily create, manipulate and change multiple factors that determine their campaign parameters, resulting in highly targeted and efficient campaigns that are simple to run and manage.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Integrated, Omnichannel and Cross-device. Our platform provides integrated access to a wide range of omnichannel inventory and data sources, as well as third-party services such as ad servers, ad verification services and survey vendors.

 | Data Management. Our data management capabilities are core to our platform, and are designed to make a broad selection of data available for real-time decision making at the most detailed level. Using our platform, users are able to purchase data from third-party vendors in a seamless and easy manner, enabling them to optimize their campaigns with the most relevant data.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Private Marketplace Support. For clients who wish to transact directly with individual publishers, we offer a comprehensive user interface for discovering and transacting via a wide variety of private pricing contracts. Additionally, we offer direct tags that advertisers can use when they negotiate deals with publishers through advertising agencies.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Technology 
 The core elements of our technology are: 
 

 | Scalable Architecture. On an average daily basis in 2016, our platform reviewed billions of ad impressions. Our platform infrastructure is hosted in 13 data centers.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Real-time Bidding. On average, our real-time bidding technology evaluates more than 400 billion ad opportunities per day, reaching over 290 million devices per day on a global basis. Our core bidding architecture is easily adaptable to a variety of inventory formats, allowing our platform to communicate with many different inventory sources.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Predictive Models. We use the massive data captured by our platform to build predictive models around user characteristics, such as demographic, purchase intent or interest data. Data from our platform is continually fed back into these models, which enables them to improve over time as the use of our platform increases.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Performance Optimization. During campaign execution, our optimization engine continually scores a variety of attributes of each impression, such as website, industry vertical or geography, for their likelihood to achieve campaign performance goals. Our bidding engine then shifts bids and budgets in real-time to deliver optimal performance. Additionally, our platform enables clients to set multiple, simultaneous optimization goals for their advertising.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Real-time Analytics. Our platform continuously collects data regarding inventory availability. In addition, real-time campaign delivery and spend totals are used to manage campaign budgets and goal caps, as well as campaign reporting. This data is fed back into our optimization engine to improve campaign performance, and into machine-learning models for user demographic predictive modeling.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Clients 
 Our clients consist of purchasers of programmatic advertising inventory and data. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 566 clients, consisting primarily of advertising agencies or groups within advertising agencies that have independent relationships with us, manage budgets independently of one-another, are based in different jurisdictions, and are served by unique Trade Desk teams. Many of these agencies are owned by holding companies, where decision-making is decentralized such that purchasing decisions are made, and relationships with advertisers are located, at the agency, local branch or division level. The number of clients is based on the party with which we have the relationship. Additionally, before being counted by us as a client, each client must have cumulatively spent more than $20,000 on our platform, signed a master service agreement with us and be able to support minimum spend thresholds. 
 If all of our individual client contractual relationships were aggregated at the holding company level, Omnicom Group Inc. would have represented more than 10% of our gross billings in 2014, Omnicom Group Inc. and WPP plc would have each represented more than 10% of our gross billings in 2015 and Omnicom Group Inc., WPP plc and Publicis Groupe would have each represented more than 10% of our gross billings in 2016. Our contractual and billing arrangement with Omnicom Group Inc. is at the holding company level and accounted for 11% of our gross billings in 2014, 12% in 2015 and 13% in 2016. For WPP plc and Publicis 
 
13 
 
 Groupe, we enter into separate contracts and billing relationships with various of its individual agencies and account for them as separate clients. We do not have any contractual relationship with the holding company WPP plc or Publicis Groupe. Mindshare, which is affiliated with WPP plc, accounted for 12% of our gross billings in 2015 and 11% in 2016. Vivaki, Inc., which is affiliated with Publicis Groupe, accounted for 15% of our gross billings in 2016. 
 Our clients typically enter into master service agreements, or MSAs, with us that give users constant access to our platform. The MSAs do not contain any material commitments on behalf of clients to use our platform to purchase ad inventory, data or other features. These MSAs typically have one year terms that renew automatically for one year periods, unless earlier terminated. The MSAs are terminable at any time upon 60 days notice by either party. 
 Our clients are loyal, as reflected by our client retention rate of over 95% in 2015 and 2016. In addition, our clients typically grow their use of our platform over time. 
 Our Advertising and Data Inventory Suppliers 
 For suppliers of programmatic advertising inventory and data, we believe that we are an important business client, as we represent one of the largest sources of buy-side demand within the digital advertising industry. 
 We obtain digital advertising inventory from over 55 ad exchanges, supply-side platforms, publishers and ad networks, providing us with access to a breadth of programmatic advertising inventory across computers, smartphones, audio devices and digital TV. 
 For third-party data vendors, we believe that we represent an important distribution channel. As of December 31, 2016, we have integrated our platform with over 105 third-party data vendors whose products we make available for purchase through our platform. 
 Our Competition 
 Our industry is highly competitive and fragmented. We compete with mostly smaller, private companies, but we also compete with divisions of large, well-established companies such as Google, as well as other demand-side platform providers. We believe that we compete primarily based on the performance, capabilities and transparency of our platform and our focus on the buy-side. We generally do not compete with advertising agencies and we refrain from serving advertisers who have a relationship with one of our clients. We believe that we are differentiated from our competitors in the following areas: 

 | we are an independent technology company exclusively focused on serving advertising agencies and the buy-side of our industry;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | our client relationships are based on master service agreements as opposed to campaign-specific insertion orders;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | our platform provides comprehensive access to a wide range of inventory types and third-party data vendors; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | our technology is differentiated and provides highly expressive targeting.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, we believe that new entrants would find it difficult to gain direct access to inventory providers, given their limited scale and the costs that additional integrations impose on inventory providers. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Given our self-serve business model, we focus on supporting, advising and training our clients to use our platform independently as soon as they are ready to transact. Our sales and marketing team, which consisted of 172 employees as of December 31, 2016, employs a consultative approach to both new and existing clients. 
 
14 
 
Once a new client has access to our platform, they work closely with our client service teams as they onboard the new client and provide continuous support throughout the early campaigns. Typically, once a client has gained some initial experience, it will move to a fully self-serve model and request support as needed. 
 To help train our clients, suppliers and other digital media participants, we have created an e-learning program called The Trading Academy. We believe that this initiative is an important component in our strategy of enabling rapid onboarding to our platform. 
 Our marketing efforts are focused on increasing awareness for our brand, executing thought-leadership initiatives, supporting our sales team and generating new leads. We seek to accomplish these objectives by presenting at industry conferences, hosting client conferences, publishing white papers and research, public relations activities, social media presence and advertising campaigns. 
 Seasonality 
 In the advertising industry, companies commonly experience seasonal fluctuations in revenue. For example, many advertisers allocate the largest portion of their budgets to the fourth quarter of the calendar year in order to coincide with increased holiday purchasing. Historically, the fourth quarter of the year reflects our highest level of advertising activity and the first quarter reflects the lowest level of such activity. We expect our revenue to continue to fluctuate based on seasonal factors that affect the advertising industry as a whole, and events such as the U.S. election cycle and the Olympics. 
Platform Development 
 Rapid innovation is a core driver of our business success and our corporate culture. We empower our development teams by encouraging them to release updated features and increase functionality fast and often. As a company, we refresh our platform on a weekly basis. Our development teams are intentionally lean and nimble in nature, providing for transparency and accountability. 
 We expect to continue investing in our technology in order to support increased volume of advertising spend on our platform and to facilitate our international expansion. In addition, we intend to invest in efforts aimed at developing new technologies and functionalities that will enhance our platform and further automate our business processes. As of December 31, 2016, we had 145 employees primarily engaged in technology and development. Our technology development expense totaled $7.3 million in 2014, $12.8 million in 2015 and $27.3 million in 2016.   Our Employees and Culture 
 As of December 31, 2016, we had 467 employees, of whom 345 are in the United States. Our team draws from a broad spectrum of backgrounds and experiences, across technology, advertising and securities trading and other areas. Led by our co-founders, Jeff T. Green and David R. Pickles, who were recognized by Ernst & Young in 2015 with Entrepreneur of the Year awards in the greater Los Angeles area, we facilitate an entrepreneurial culture so that we may remain focused and innovative over time, as we strive to serve our clients with openness, transparency and humility. When hiring, we place a special emphasis on our key cultural attributes of Grit, Humility, Emotional Intelligence and Generosity, which we believe have been instrumental in delivering value to our clients and thus contributing to our growth. 
 We have been consistently ranked as one of the best places to work for in the advertising industry as recognized by awards from Inc., Entrepreneur, Crains New York, Outside Magazine and the Great Place to Work Institute. We believe that our low employee voluntary turnover rate since our founding is a testament to our culture and team spirit. 
 Development of International Markets 
 We have recently increased our focus on markets outside the United States to serve the global needs of our clients. We believe that the global opportunity for programmatic advertising is significant, and should continue to 
 
15 
 
 expand as publishers and advertisers outside the United States seek to adopt the benefits that programmatic advertising provides. To capitalize on this opportunity, we intend to continue to invest to grow our presence internationally, including in China, where we have not historically operated to date. Our growth and the success of our initiatives in newer markets will depend on the continued adoption of our platform by our existing clients, as well as new clients, in these markets. Information about our geographic gross billings is set forth in Note 12 of Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Intellectual Property 
 The protection of our technology and intellectual property is an important component of our success. We rely on intellectual property laws, including trade secret, copyright and trademark laws in the United States and abroad, and use contracts, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements and other contractual rights to protect our intellectual property. We hold no patents because we believe our proprietary technology is best protected by keeping our technology architecture, trade secrets, and engineering roadmap private. We believe our platform is difficult to replicate and would be expensive to build. We also believe that the most important protection in digital advertising technology is the ability to execute and deliver new functionality quickly, and are continually developing new intellectual property as we innovate. 
Privacy and Data Protection Regulation 
 Privacy and data protection legislation and regulation play a significant role in our business. We and our clients use non-identifiable data about Internet users collected through our platform to manage and execute digital advertising campaigns in a variety of ways, including delivering advertisements to Internet users based on their particular geographic locations, the type of device they are using, or their interests as inferred from their web browsing or app usage activity. We do not use this data to identify specific individuals, and we do not seek to associate this data with information that can be used to identify specific individuals. We take steps not to collect or store personally identifiable information, or personal data, from any source. The definitions of personally identifiable information and personal data, however, vary by jurisdiction and are evolving. As a result, our platform and business practices must be assessed regularly in each jurisdiction where we do business to avoid violating applicable legislation and regulation. 
 In the United States, both state and federal legislation govern activities such as the collection and use of data by companies like us. Digital advertising in the United States has primarily been subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission, or the FTC, which has primarily relied upon Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, which prohibits companies from engaging in unfair or deceptive trade practices, including alleged violations of representations concerning privacy protections and acts that allegedly violate individuals privacy interests. Because our platform reaches users throughout the world, some of our activities may also be subject to foreign legislation. As we continue to expand internationally, we will be subject to additional legislation and regulation, and these laws may affect how we conduct business. 
 Additionally, U.S. and foreign governments have enacted or are considering enacting legislation that could significantly restrict our ability to collect, augment, analyze, use and share data collected through cookies and similar technologies, such as by regulating the level of consumer notice and consent required before a company can employ cookies or other electronic tools to track people online. In the United States, the FTC has commenced the examination of privacy issues that arise when marketers track consumers across multiple devices, otherwise known as cross-device tracking. In the European Union, or EU, Directive 2009/136/EC, commonly referred to as the Cookie Directive, directs EU member states to ensure that accessing information on an Internet users computer, such as through a cookie, is allowed only if the Internet user has given his or her consent. In response, some member states have adopted and implemented, and may continue to adopt and implement, legislation that impacts the use of cookies for online advertising. For instance, on October 19, 2016, the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that IP addresses in certain circumstances are personal data 
 
16 
 
 under current EU governing law, at least when such IP addresses are held by ISPs and other companies that have the ability to identify a users real-life identity. The EU also recently enacted the General Data Protection Regulation, which is anticipated to take effect in May 2018 and similarly will restrict the collection and use of IP addresses, cookie identifiers, and device identifiers for advertising purposes. 
 In prior years, some government regulators and privacy advocates advocated vigorously for a Do Not Track standard that would allow Internet users to express a preference, independent of cookie settings in their browser, not to have their online browsing activities tracked. In 2010, the FTC issued a staff report emphasizing the need for simplified notice, choice and transparency to the consumer regarding the collection, use and sharing of data, and suggested implementing a Do Not Track browser setting that would allow consumers to choose whether or not to allow tracking of their online browsing activities. All major Internet browsers have implemented some version of a Do Not Track setting. However, there is no commonly accepted definition of tracking, no consensus regarding what message is conveyed by a Do Not Track setting and no industry standards regarding how to respond to a Do Not Track preference. The World Wide Web Consortium chartered a Tracking Protection Working Group in 2011 to convene a multi-stakeholder group of academics, thought leaders, companies, industry groups and consumer advocacy organizations, to create a voluntary Do Not Track standard for the World Wide Web. The group has yet to agree upon a standard that has the backing of industry. California amended its main privacy law, the California Online Privacy Protection Act, or CalOPPA, to require companies to declare in their privacy policies how they respond to Do Not Track signals or similar mechanisms, and Delaware recently enacted a similar requirement in the Delaware Online Privacy and Protection Act, or DOPPA. Neither CalOPPA nor DOPPA, however, requires any particular response to those signals. 
 We participate in several industry self-regulatory programs, mainly initiated by the Network Advertising Initiative, or NAI, the Digital Advertising Alliance, or DAA, and their international counterparts. Under such programs, in addition to other compliance obligations, we provide consumers with notice about our use of cookies and similar technologies and our collection and use of data in connection with the delivery of targeted advertising. We also allow consumers to opt out from the use of data we collect for the delivery of targeted advertising, and we provide consumers notice with how to exercise such choice. We believe that this user-centric approach to addressing consumer privacy empowers consumers to make informed decisions on the use of their data.
