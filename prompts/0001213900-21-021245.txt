The Allied Esports Business



Gaming is one of the largest and fastest growing markets in the entertainment sector, with an estimated 2.7 billion gamers globally, and esports is the major driver of this growth. Esports, short for “electronic sports,” is a general label that comprises a diverse offering of competitive electronic games that gamers play against each other. Some of the popular esports games currently being played include Fortnite, League of Legends, Dota 2, Counter-Strike, Call of Duty, Overwatch and FIFA. Although you can play games on your own against the computer or console, one of the ways esports is different than the video games of old is the community and spectator nature of esports, whereby competitive play against another person — either one-on-one or in teams — that is viewed by an online and in-person audience, is a central feature of esports. Since players play against each other online, a global network of players and viewers has developed as these players compete against each other worldwide. Additionally, game developers have greatly increased the watchability of games, which has made the spectator aspect of gaming much more prevalent and further drives expansion of the gaming market. The expanded reach of high-speed Internet service and the computer technology advances in the last decade have also greatly accelerated the growth of esports. Esports has now become so popular that many colleges offer scholarships in esports and the best-known esports teams are receiving mainstream sponsorships and are being bought or invested in by celebrities, athletes and professional sports teams. The highest profile esports gamers have significant online audiences as they stream themselves playing against other players online and potentially can generate millions of dollars in sponsorship money and subscription fees from their online streaming channels. It is projected that by 2023, 646 million people will be watching esports globally, and that global esports revenue will grow to approximately $1.5 billion.



WPT successfully implemented a three-pillar strategy for over 16 years of its 18-year history. We believe this model can continue and also be applied to Allied Esports and the esports industry over time. Allied Esports intends to use those same pillars — in-person experiences, multiplatform content, and interactive services—independently and in connection with its strategic partners. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruption in our long-term growth plans for Allied Esports, and although our long-term strategy remains to fully implement the three-pillar strategy, we are currently focused on continuing our in-person experiences at our current arenas and developing multiplatform content. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruption in our long-term growth plans for Allied Esports, and although our long-term strategy remains to fully implement the three-pillar strategy, we are currently focused on continuing our in-person experiences at our current arenas and developing multiplatform content.



In June 2019, Allied Esports entered into a series of strategic transactions with Simon Equity Development, LLC and its affiliates (collectively, “Simon”), a global leader in the ownership of premier shopping, dining, entertainment, and mixed-use destinations, pursuant to which Allied Esports organized and staged an esports event program called the Simon Cup at certain Simon shopping centers in the U.S. and online. In January 2020, Allied Esports entered into a strategic partnership with Brookfield Property Partners, one of the world’s premier real estate companies, in which Allied Esports will develop integrated esports experience venues at mutually agreed upon shopping malls owned and/or operated by Brookfield or its affiliates that will include a dedicated gaming space and production capabilities to attract and to activate esports and other emerging live events. In connection with the foregoing partnership, Brookfield made a $5 million equity investment into the Company. As a result of the adverse effects that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the short-term operations and plans of Allied Esports, Allied Esports and its strategic partners are delaying further execution on their strategic plans as the COVID-19 pandemic continues.

In-person Experiences



Allied Esports will continue delivering first-in-class live experiences to customers at Allied Esports’ branded properties worldwide. Starting with the flagship esports arena, the HyperX Esports Arena Las Vegas, the AE Studios in Germany, its on-mall esports venues – the first of which that is planned to be open at the Mall of Georgia with construction and opening dates postponed until further assessment can be made following the COVID-19 pandemic, and its affiliate arenas in China and Australia, Allied Esports offers esports fans state-of-the-art facilities to compete against other players in esports competitions, host live events with esports superstars that potentially stream to millions of viewers worldwide, produce and distribute incredible esports content with its on-site production facilities and studios and provide an attractive facility for hosting corporate events, tournaments, game launches or other events. Additionally, Allied Esports has two mobile esports arenas, which are 18-wheel semi-trailers that convert into first class esports arenas and competition stages with full content production capabilities and interactive talent studios. Through this worldwide network of arenas, Allied Esports believes it can offer customers an unmatched ability to participate in simultaneous global esports events and offer sponsors and partners a truly scalable global platform and audience to promote their businesses and products. Allied Esports’ flagship HyperX Esports Arena Las Vegas serves as a marquee destination for esports fans globally, and has become one of the most recognized esports venues in the world.



Flagship Arena. In March 2018, Allied Esports opened its first flagship arena, the HyperX Esports Arena Las Vegas, at the Luxor Casino on the Vegas strip, whose pyramid is one of the most visible landmarks in Las Vegas. This arena has 80 to 100 gaming stations, two bars, food service, private rooms, a production facility, and space for up to 1,000 people for events. The arena is custom-built for esports tournaments and has a broadcast-ready television studio to broadcast live events and produce content. Allied Esports monetizes the arena through renting the space for live events; merchandise sales; daily usage fees from day-to-day gamers using the gaming stations; tournament entry and player venue fees; food and beverage; and sponsorship (i.e., our HyperX naming rights relationship).



Affiliate Arenas. One of Allied Esports’ strategic advantages is its global network of esports arena partners, which enables it to host events and promote competitions around the world, with those competitions culminating in live events held at the flagship arena in Las Vegas. Allied Esports achieves this through its Affiliate Program, which consists of strategic partnerships with third-party esports operators around the globe. Allied Esports generally charges these affiliates an upfront fee and a minimal annual revenue share of gross revenue, starting in the second year of the operation of the venue. Allied Esports’ brand visibility and reputation have already resulted in affiliate arrangements with arenas and gaming centers in China and a multi-year agreement with Fortress Esports Pty Ltd, a new gaming, esports and entertainment venue enterprise in Australia, which opened its first affiliate arena in Melbourne in March 2020 and reopened during the COVID-19 pandemic in December 2020. This network of affiliate arenas allows Allied Esports to scale its brand penetration worldwide on a rapid basis, driving more gamers into the Allied Esports ecosystem, with minimal costs to Allied Esports. Furthermore, the content that can be produced by these affiliate arenas can be on-sold by Allied Esports, with minimal production costs.



Mobile Arenas. The mobile arenas are 18-wheeler trucks that expand out into fully functional esports arenas with event hosting, broadcasting and production capabilities. The mobility of the trucks makes them ideal for sponsors to reach a large audience in multiple locations at an economical cost. The trucks serve as mobile billboards for potential third-party sponsorship, as well as the Allied Esports brand, providing highly visible brand presence wherever they appear. Allied Esports currently has two mobile arena trucks, with the first truck based in Germany and serving the European market, and a second truck based in Las Vegas and serving the U.S. market.



Strategic Investor Events. In addition to Allied Esports utilizing in-person experiences at its flagship, mobile and affiliate arenas, Allied Esports plans to leverage its experience to develop events and content with its strategic investors, Simon Property Group and Brookfield Property Partners.



Allied Esports plans to collaborate with Brookfield Property Partners to create a new product offering focused on delivering esports experiences through integrated gaming venues and production facilities in select shopping centers around the U.S. that are owned and/or operated by Brookfield. The on-mall venues will be designed to activate esports and other emerging live events through tournament play of all levels and daily use, featuring PC and console gaming, plus full food and beverage options, and experiential retail. The venues will have the capability to be expanded into common areas for larger esports activations and live events.

In addition, on September 30, 2019, Allied Esports and Simon launched The Simon Cup, a co-branded esports competition and gaming tournament series of on-mall regional festivals combining online and in-person play at select Simon centers in the New York and Los Angeles markets, with the winners of the regionals moving on to HyperX Esports Arena Las Vegas, where the first Simon Cup Champion was crowned on November 23, 2019.



As a result of the material adverse effects that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the short-term operations and plans of Allied Esports, Allied Esports and its strategic partners are delaying further execution on their strategic plans as the COVID-19 pandemic continues.



Multiplatform Content: Leveraging Branded Properties and Strategic Partnerships to Develop Content



Allied Esports’ worldwide network of branded esports properties provides Allied Esports with a platform to potentially develop a significant amount of content to distribute via digital live streams, broadcast and cable, and social media outlets. Allied Esports believes that its arenas will draw top-level esports talent (such as professional streamer Ninja, who was the featured talent at a successful event at Allied Esports’ Las Vegas arena in April 2018) for purposes of hosting events and developing content, which it can distribute live, post-produce into fully-produced episodic content, or repackage for over the top streaming platform and social media distribution. Allied Esports intends to monetize the content in multiple ways, including direct sales of the content, sponsorship revenue, and subscription and/or advertising fees for viewers of the content.



We believe Allied Esports’ ecosystem of esports branded properties gives it the reach, reputation and experience to produce world-class live events, in partnership with some of the most prominent names in the esports industry. These live events provide Allied Esports with the material to produce exciting content that can be distributed via three different formats, each of which has its own revenue generation model: live streaming, post-produced episodic content, and short-form repackaged content.



Live Streaming. Live streaming is the most popular esports content delivery channel today, as it offers the best interactive experiences for the audience. Vast improvements in technology and Internet service and speed have made live streaming with large audiences widely available today. Well-known gamers live stream themselves playing their favorite games on any of the popular streaming services (Twitch, YouTube, Facebook Gaming, etc.) to a worldwide audience. The streamers derive revenue from ad sales, sponsorship, subscription fees and gift payments from spectators. Through Allied Esports’ ecosystem of esports arenas, Allied Esports can offer streamers a large platform to put on live events that can be simultaneously streamed on both the streamer’s channels and on Allied Esports’ channels. An example is a streaming event Allied Esports held with one of the most prominent streamers in esports, Tyler Blevins, AKA Ninja, in April 2018. Famous for his streaming channel where he plays the popular esports game Fortnite, Ninja held a live event at the Las Vegas flagship arena that set records for Twitch live streams, with over 667,000 peak concurrent viewers and 2.4 million unique viewers. To put those audience numbers in perspective, those numbers are significantly higher than viewership of the average regular season NBA game in 2019. Allied Esports was able to sell multiple sponsorships for the event and earned significant revenue from the food and beverage, merchandise sales and usage fees from the gaming stations. Although large audiences can be garnered through these live event streams, there are limitations on the streams, as they have a one-and-done nature; repeat viewing is not popular for these events, which limits the sponsorship opportunities.



Post-Produced Content. Allied Esports intends to develop esports entertainment programming around its live experiences and, using its experienced editing and production teams, create serial, episodic content and segments that tell compelling storylines around its gaming talent, in person experiences, and gaming events around the world. Allied Esports developed this technique through the WPT, who took the slow-paced game of poker and dramatized it and created storylines that made for exciting and compelling viewing. This post-produced content can be valuable real estate for sponsors, as Allied Esports can integrate sponsors seamlessly into the show in a way that feels organic to the viewers. Allied Esports can focus on different storylines, create excitement via editing and music inclusion, and generally elevate the production quality from that achievable in a live stream. Allied Esports can then monetize this episodic content via sponsorship, advertising, selling the content itself to third party distributors, or even use it as a marketing tool to drive customers to come to Allied Esports’ branded properties, buy its merchandise or otherwise interact with Allied Esports.





3







Repackaged Content. The library of content Allied Esports will develop from events can be cut into smaller clips that can be used as marketing and promotion of the Allied Esports brand on social media. Allied Esports can also edit content to create new content, such as “best of” shows, focusing on one particular game as played by multiple well-known streamers, regional shows focusing on talent from a particular country, and so on.



Allied Esports’ global branded esports properties ecosystem will create opportunities for live events which provide material to develop great content, all of which Allied Esports can monetize in multiple ways. The large customer base Allied Esports develops through these in-person experiences, live streams and content distribution will give it a customer base to launch interactive services.



Interactive Services: Developing an Esports Entertainment Platform



Allied Esports intends to develop its own online platform where esports players and fans can watch, play and win with other members of the esports community and top esports personalities. The online platform will enable fans to compete against each other as well as participate in esports programs starring their favorite players. Subscriptions will provide members with exclusive access to numerous unique and proprietary experiences, products and services that are not available outside of Allied Esports’ ecosystem, such as exclusive online content, member-only tournaments, prizes and cash awards, exclusive live event and merchandise access, exclusive opportunities to be part of our entertainment programming, VIP treatment at Allied Esports’ arenas, and much more. Allied Esports intends to use the authenticity and reach driven by its in-person experiences and content viewership to drive platform adoption by esports fans. Allied Esports’ executive team has years of experience developing online platforms — its CEO, Frank Ng, has managed and run online platforms with approximately 700 million registered users in China for over 14 years, and its COO, David Moon, has produced, published and operated numerous game services for over 20 years, including helping build NHN Corporation’s global footprint to over 1 million concurrent users. Furthermore, WPT has developed and operated its subscription platform for poker fans, ClubWPT, since 2010, and developed and operated a social poker product, PlayWPT, starting in 2016. PlayWPT was licensed to a third party in May of 2018.
The WPT Business



The Company owns the World Poker Tour® (WPT®) — a premier name in internationally televised gaming and entertainment with brand presence in land-based poker tournaments, television, online and mobile. A leading innovator in the sport of poker since 2002, WPT helped ignite the global poker boom with the creation of a unique television show based on a series of high-stakes poker tournaments. WPT’s Tour Events are held at locations throughout the world and have awarded more than one billion in prize dollars in its 18-year history. WPT has broadcast globally in more than 150 countries and territories, and is currently producing its 18th season, which airs on FOX Sports Regional Networks in the United States. Season 18 of WPT is sponsored by its online subscription-based poker service, ClubWPT.com. WPT offers a suite of online poker services which it operates by itself and through its partners offering consumers the ability to access gaming content on a year-round 24/7 basis. ClubWPT.com is a unique online membership site that offers inside access to the WPT, as well as a sweepstakes-based poker club available in 43 states and territories across the United States, Australia, Canada, France and the United Kingdom, with innovative features and state-of-the-art creative elements inspired by WPT’s 18 years of experience in gaming entertainment. In June 2020, ClubWPT launched a premium level of ClubWPT membership called ClubWPT Diamond, which allows members to play for larger prize pools, more qualifying seats to official WPT live events, and exclusive line-ups of unique experience packages. In addition, WPT licenses its brand to social gaming sites through partners like Zynga as well as to educational learning platforms such as LearnWPT. These online products are scalable and offer geographic access that might be limited if WPT relied on tour stop participation alone. Additionally, WPT benefits from managing its own distribution business which currently has more than 1,100 hours of broadcast-ready content, and offers demographically similar programming to its poker content, such as esports, golf and MMA. WPT uses this large suite of programming as leverage to seek preferred airtimes on its various distribution channels where it may promote its online products or offer airtime to sponsors in territories they seek to enter. WPT also participates in strategic brand license, partnership, sponsorship opportunities and music licensing. As described below, WPT applies a three-pillar model of in-person experiences, developing multiplatform content and providing interactive services, to the sport of poker.

In-person Experiences: Worldwide Poker Tournaments



World Poker Tour Events. The WPT is a sports league of affiliated poker tournaments that are held at prestigious casinos and poker rooms around the world. WPT licenses the WPT brand to these casinos and card rooms so that they can brand their poker tournaments as WPT events, and these events are integrated into WPT’s tour. These events form the backbone of WPT’s brand identity and have turned the WPT into one of the most recognizable names in gaming. WPT has developed different types of tours, generally distinguishable by the size of the buy-in for competitors in the applicable tour’s events. The WPT Main Tour events generally have the biggest buy-ins (usually between $3,500 and $10,000), are held at the largest and most prestigious casinos and card rooms and are attended by many of the top professional poker players in the world. The WPT DeepStacks Tour and WPT500 events are smaller than Main Tour events, with buy-ins ranging from $300 to $1,000, and are meant to cater to the lower- to medium-stakes players. In addition, through a third-party licensing arrangement, WPT licenses its name to a third party operating the WPT League, which are small bar-league poker events held at bars and clubs on a social basis. These live events create touchpoints to a large community of poker players to whom WPT can market other WPT live events, advertise and market its sponsor’s products, and push towards its interactive products. Furthermore, the live events create the content WPT uses to monetize its brand, as set forth below. The World Poker Tour live events have been postponed during the recent outbreak of the COVID-19 virus throughout the world.
Multiplatform Content: The World Poker Tour Television Shows



The Content. WPT films the final table of six participants from a select group of WPT’s Main Tour stops, where the players compete for some of the poker world’s largest tournament prize pools. We then edit the footage from these tour stops, resulting in a series of one-hour or two-hour episodes which are distributed for telecast to both domestic audiences via our broadcast agreement with Sinclair, and international television audiences via numerous international distribution agreements. WPT has an agreement with Poker Go, a prominent poker-centric online platform, pursuant to which WPT live streams many of its events to Poker Go’s customer base. Many of WPT’s live events that are not broadcast on Sinclair are live streamed on Poker Go, which ensures almost all of WPT’s events are broadcast on some format. In addition, WPT films and produces special episodes based on a variety of non-traditional poker tournaments and/or cash games, which it also distributes for telecast along with the episodes based on WPT’s regular tour stops. Furthermore, WPT produced specialized shows meant to promote and market its ClubWPT membership site, such as its “King of the Club” shows in which ClubWPT members won the right, by winning certain tournaments on the ClubWPT platform, to play against each other for cash and prizes in a single-table tournament that was filmed and broadcast on FSN. WPT also filmed and prepared for distribution another series of shows to promote ClubWPT called “Challenge the Champs”, in which ClubWPT members who qualified on the ClubWPT platform received the chance to play against former WPT Main Tour champions for cash and prizes. These episodes premiered on FSN in August and September 2019.



WPT previously produced and broadcasted on FSN a series of shows called WPT Alpha8, based on a series of high-stakes poker tournaments with buy-ins of $100,000. In the Alpha8 events, some of the most elite high-stakes players in the world played in poker tournaments against one another in glamorous casinos and card rooms around the world, with the final eight players of each tournament filmed for production of the television episodes. The inaugural season of WPT Alpha8 began in 2013 and aired for three seasons, ending in 2016 and continues to be distributed internationally. In addition to the strategic advantage of the “World Poker Tour” and WPT-related brands, WPT has created significant efficiencies in its content programming through its affiliation and use of Allied ESports’ HyperX Esports Arena Las Vegas venue to film some of its Main Tour final tables and other special events. This change, which just began for Season 17, has significantly reduced production costs by reducing transportation and set up fees and has allowed for more content to be produced at a significantly more efficient cost. Moreover, by reducing the physical location needs from its casino partners that would otherwise be featured in a WPT televised event, WPT has greatly expanded the number of potential casino customers that can meet the requirements for hosting a WPT televised final table. Finally, WPT creates, owns and publishes its own music for WPT shows. In addition to receiving royalties for the music integrated into these programs, WPT has created a database of over 2,300 musical pieces which may be licensed for itself or for other third-party producers.

WPT Distribution Footprint. All of the WPT television programs air on Sinclair’s RSNs in the U.S., and in 33 different territories worldwide pursuant to licensing and distribution arrangements with various linear and digital networks. Virtually all of WPT’s 17-season poker library is fully available for distribution, providing hundreds of hours of top-tier broadcast grade poker sports content. WPT has greatly expanded the reach of its content by licensing it for broadcast on many digital platforms as well, such as PlutoTV, Unreel Entertainment, Samsung TV Plus, and many others. WPT does not receive fees from Sinclair for the domestic distribution of our content. Instead, WPT uses the WPT show to heavily promote its ClubWPT product and other online products and partnerships, such as Zynga’s WPT social poker game. WPT does provide Sinclair with a guaranteed revenue share from ClubWPT’s operations in exchange for significant promotion and distribution of the programs featuring ClubWPT marketing. This arrangement ensures that Sinclair has an incentive to keep WPT’s show on the air and to market and promote the show, as they share in the show’s success to the extent ClubWPT’s revenue increases. Since the ClubWPT customer base and broadcast television viewers are similar in demographics, the symbiotic relationship between Sinclair and WPT works well to keep WPT’s brand widely known and accessible to millions of people in the U.S. The Sinclair agreement also has other important broadcast requirements to ensure that WPT’s programming remains “appointment television” and airs at particular times on both the Sinclair networks and the RSNs. Internationally, some of WPT’s distribution partners pay WPT fees to broadcast content, but usually, WPT’s international revenues are based on distribution deals that pay via advertising time and sponsorship sales, as well as the intrinsic value of spreading WPT’s brand awareness worldwide. The international reach of WPT-related shows has grown meaningfully as a result of our expanding digital distribution footprint. WPT receives additional fees from our digital distribution agreements, but again see these as brand-building exercises and as avenues to get more people exposure for WPT’s online products, sponsors and advertisers. In addition to its World Poker Tour content, WPT also distributes various sports and lifestyle programming through its distribution business. As a result, WPT now controls over 1,100 hours of programming from which it may generate distribution fees, license fees, sponsorship revenue and music licensing revenue, as well as serving as a vehicle to promote its online gaming products worldwide. The ability to “bundle,” or offer large amounts of content, provides WPT distribution leverage in negotiating the amount of airings or preferred airing times of its content.



The Walt Disney Company (“Disney”) recently acquired 21st Century Fox (“FOX”). Under the terms of the acquisition, FOX’s non-regional news and sports assets, including FSN, were spun off into a new company, Fox Corporation (which is commonly referred to as “New Fox”), which remains owned by the prior FOX shareholders. The Department of Justice required Disney to sell all RSNs within ninety (90) days after the closing of the Disney/FOX acquisition. The RSNs (including FSN) were recently purchased by a joint venture company owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group and Entertainment Studios, Inc. (collectively, “Sinclair”). To date, Sinclair’s acquisition of the RSNs (including FSN) has not had any material effect on the airing of WPT’s content.



Sponsorship Revenue. Sponsorship revenue is the prime economic driver of the distribution of WPT content. WPT partners with prestigious brands, such as Dr. Pepper (soft drinks), Hublot (high-end timepieces), Corona (beer), Rockstar (energy drinks), Baccarat (fine crystal), Party Poker (online gaming in Europe), and offers them the ability to become the “Official ________ of the World Poker Tour”. The Season 17 sponsors have included Hublot, Rockstar, Baccarat, Faded Spade Poker (a playing card manufacturer), and Zynga Inc. (social gaming operator). WPT is able to seamlessly integrate its sponsors into the WPT television show by displaying sponsors on poker tables, on television sets, and specialized segments that are brought to viewers by the applicable sponsor. By integrating WPT’s sponsors into the show, WPT provides a powerful marketing tool in that viewers are seeing the sponsor as part of the show they are watching, as opposed to an advertisement that they may mute or skip if possible. WPT’s live events also offer WPT sponsors a great advertising platform to market directly to WPT players via signage, product sampling suites, flyers, and similar marketing endeavors.



Interactive Services: Poker Platforms



WPT’s live event global footprint and distribution of its content via broadcast, streaming and social media, allow WPT to generate significant marketing opportunities for both its sponsors and its own products. WPT has taken advantage of this marketing arm to promote several interactive products: ClubWPT, its subscription-based online poker club that WPT owns and operates, which also offers social poker; PlayWPT, a web and mobile social poker product that is operated by a third party utilizing software and branding that WPT licenses to such provider; Zynga Poker, who operates one of the world’s largest social poker products, to whom WPT has licensed its brand for certain WPT-branded poker tournaments on their platform; and HongKong Triple Sevens Interactive Co., Ltd, who licenses WPT’s Alpha8 brand to operate a social poker product they are in the process of developing.

ClubWPT. WPT’s subscription-based online club, ClubWPT.com, is operated in accordance with the principles of sweepstakes law and is available in 43 states and territories across the United States, Australia, Canada, France and the United Kingdom. A free alternative means of entry is offered for participants who wish to play in the tournaments but do not wish to purchase the other membership benefits. VIP members can play poker to win a share of $100,000 in cash and prizes every month, including seats in live WPT poker tournaments. Other benefits include access to every season of the WPT television series and all related content, discounted tickets to live events through ScoreBig, everyday savings for everyday things via the ClubWPT Entertainment Savers Guide, and other member benefits. In January of 2019, WPT added freemium social poker and casino gaming on the platform. Since that time, daily active revenue has risen steadily, and we anticipate the freemium products on the platform will be a meaningful driver of ClubWPT revenue going forward. The subscription fee for ClubWPT remains the same each month and players are not allowed to wager actual money online. One must be eighteen or older to participate. In June 2020, ClubWPT launched a premium level of ClubWPT membership called ClubWPT Diamond, which allows members to play for larger prize pools, more qualifying seats to official WPT live events, and exclusive line-up of unique experience packages.



Zynga Poker. WPT entered into a 3-year licensing agreement with Zynga, Inc. in 2018 pursuant to which Zynga agreed to pay WPT $3 million per year in exchange for the right to license the WPT name and brand to its massive social gaming database for WPT-branded poker tournaments on the Zynga social poker platform. WPT supports Zynga’s efforts through extensive marketing of its brand through its marketing network which includes its television programs, advertisements, and social media channels. Zynga has further used the WPT tournaments as a vehicle to reward their players through qualifying players to play in real money poker tournaments at WPT affiliated casinos. The partnership means that the Zynga and WPT brands elevate each other’s profile in the poker community through millions of impressions annually.



PlayWPT and Alpha8 Social Poker. WPT’s 3-year license agreements for PlayWPT and the Alpha8 social poker product that each commenced in 2018 provide WPT with a share of all revenue generated on those respective platforms, with annual minimums of the greater of $500,000 or 20% of revenue generated for PlayWPT, and the greater of $200,000 or 20% of revenue generated for the Alpha8 social poker product. These arrangements offer WPT significant annual payments based on the value and prestige of WPT’s brands and WPT’s ability to market and promote the platforms.



In addition to the three-pillar approach to monetizing the WPT brands as described above, WPT has also been able to combine these approaches in a regional manner to create localized versions of the WPT in other parts of the world. For example, WPT has an agreement with Adda52, one of the largest online poker operators in India, pursuant to which Adda52 utilizes WPT brands to put on WPT-branded tournaments, create and sell WPT merchandise, sponsor and distribute WPT content, and otherwise market and promote their own products using the WPT name. WPT had a similar arrangement for the Asia-Pacific region with WPT’s former parent company, Ourgame, and is negotiating similar arrangements with parties in other parts of the world, such as Latin America. These brand licensing arrangements not only provide WPT with revenue derived from upfront payments and revenue share, but they broaden WPT’s brand reach in localized ways to parts of the world that WPT would be hard-pressed to effectively market to on its own. WPT believes that this increased reach will have long-term benefits to WPT’s brand image and profitability.



Recent Developments.




On January 19, 2021, the Company and its direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries, Allied Esports Media, Inc. (“Esports Media,” and together with the Company, the “Selling Parties”) and Club Services, Inc. (“CSI”), entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Original Agreement”) with Element Partners, LLC (“Buyer”), pursuant to which the Selling Parties have agreed to sell 100% of the outstanding capital stock of CSI to Buyer. CSI is the Company’s indirect wholly-owned subsidiary that directly or indirectly owns 100% of the outstanding capital stock of each of the legal entities that collectively operate or engage in the Company’s poker-related business and assets (the “WPT Business”). The proposed sale of CSI is referred to herein as the “Sale Transaction.” In connection with the Original Agreement, Buyer agreed to pay Esports Media a total purchase price of $78.25 million for the stock of CSI, including an initial purchase price at closing of $68.25 million and $10.0 million in future payments after the closing of the Sale Transaction. After the execution of the Original Agreement, the Company received multiple unsolicited competing proposals to sell the Company and/or CSI to Bally’s Corporation. As a result of such proposals and further negotiation with Buyer, the Selling Parties, CSI and Buyer entered into an Amended and Restated Stock Purchase Agreement on March 19, 2021, and thereafter amended such agreement on March 29, 2021 (as amended, the “Stock Purchase Agreement”).

Buyer has agreed to pay Esports Media a total purchase price of $105 million for the stock of CSI (the “base purchase price”) at the closing of the Sale Transaction, as further described below. The base purchase price will be adjusted to reflect the amount of CSI’s cash, indebtedness and accrued and unpaid transaction expenses as of the closing of the Sale Transaction. Buyer remitted a $10.0 million advance payment of the base purchase price upon the execution of the Stock Purchase Agreement and is required to pay the balance of the base purchase price at the closing of the Sale Transaction.



The Stock Purchase Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, covenants and indemnification provisions. The closing of the Sale Transaction is subject to closing conditions, including the approval of the Sale Transaction by the Company’s stockholders and other customary closing conditions. The Company intends to consummate the Sale Transaction shortly after obtaining stockholder approval, assuming all other conditions to the completion of the Sale Transaction have been satisfied or waived by the appropriate parties.



The Stock Purchase Agreement may be terminated by Buyer or the Company if the closing of the Sale Transaction has not occurred by September 30, 2021, or upon the occurrence of certain customary events as set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement. Depending on the circumstances surrounding a termination of the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Buyer may be required to pay a $10.0 million non-performance fee to the Company, and the Selling Parties may be required to pay a $3.45 million termination fee to the Buyer, and the Selling Parties may be required to return to Buyer the $10.0 million advance payment of the purchase price and reimburse Buyer for up to $1.0 million of its documented out of pocket expenses incurred in connection with the authorization, preparation, negotiation, execution and performance of the Stock Purchase Agreement and the Sale Transaction.



Effective upon any termination of the Stock Purchase Agreement, other than a termination in which Buyer is required to pay a non-performance fee to us, Buyer (or its affiliate) and Peerless Media Limited, an indirect subsidiary of the Company that owns intellectual property related to the WPT Business, will enter into a 3-year brand license for Buyer’s (or its affiliate’s) use of the WPT brand in the territory of Asia for real-money gaming in exchange for revenue-based royalty payments of 20% of qualifying revenues, and minimum annual guaranteed royalty payments of $4.0 million, $6.0 million and $8.0 million for the first, second and third years, respectively. Such license will be subject to further customary terms and conditions and provide Peerless Media Limited with a $2.0 million buy-out right after the first year. In the event of any termination of the Stock Purchase Agreement under any circumstance in which the Buyer is required to pay a termination fee to us, the Company will have the option, but not the obligation, to require the Buyer to enter into such license agreement with Peerless Media Limited.



The rapid growth and popularity of gaming and esports during the COVID-19 pandemic has driven interest in the Company’s esports business, Allied Esports. In January 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors decided to explore strategic options for the esports business in order to maximize value to its stockholders, including a possible sale, and the Company has engaged a financial advisor to assist with the process. If the Company pursues and ultimately completes a sale of the esports business in addition to the sale of the WPT Business in the Sale Transaction (described below), the Company expects to proceed (likely under a new name) as a publicly traded holding company focused on using its cash resources to explore opportunities in online entertainment, including but not limited to, real money gaming and other gaming sectors. However, the Company does not plan to limit itself to any particular industry or geographic location in its efforts to identify prospective target businesses. Currently, the Company does not have any specific merger, asset acquisition, reorganization or other business combination under consideration or contemplation. At this time no potential or particular buyer has been identified to purchase the esports business, and there are no initial or ongoing negotiations in respect of the sale of the esports business.

Allied Esports Media, Inc. (“AEM”), a Delaware corporation, was formed in November 2018 to act as a holding company for Allied Esports International Inc.

Regulation



WPT tournaments are conducted by the host casinos and card rooms, and we believe WPT is not subject to government gaming regulation in connection with its affiliation with and telecasts of these events. We continue to monitor the legality of Internet gaming in domestic and international jurisdictions, but cannot be certain that changes in existing regulations will be beneficial to the gaming market. WPT’s subscription-based online club, ClubWPT.com, is operated in accordance with the principles of sweepstakes law. A free alternative means of entry is offered for participants who wish to play in the tournaments but do not wish to purchase the other membership benefits. The subscription fee for ClubWPT remains the same each month and players are not allowed to wager actual money online. One must be eighteen or older to participate. However, the awarding of cash and prizes will require compliance with the laws or regulations in various states or countries over sweepstakes, promotions and giveaways, are complicated and constantly changing.

Competition



WPT competes with other poker-related television programming, including ESPN’s coverage of the “World Series of Poker” and its “World Series of Poker” Circuit Events, among others. These and other producers of poker-related programming are well established and may have significantly greater resources than WPT does. Based on the popularity of these poker-related televised programs, WPT believes that additional competing televised poker programs may currently be in development or may be developed in the future. WPT’s programming also competes for telecast audiences and advertising revenue with telecasts of mainstream professional and amateur sports, as well as other entertainment and leisure activities.



The esports gaming industry is also competitive. Competitors range from established leagues and championships owned directly, as well as leagues franchised by well-known and capitalized game publishers and developers, interactive entertainment companies, diversified media companies and emerging start-ups. New competitors will likely continue to emerge, and many of these competitors will have greater financial resources than Allied Esports.



Territories



We sell products and services throughout the world.



Employees



As of April 11, 2021, we had approximately 114 employees, including 44 employees that operated under collective-bargaining agreements.
