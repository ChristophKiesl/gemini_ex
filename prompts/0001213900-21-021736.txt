ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

History and Company Overview
 
We are a provider of modular facilities (“Modules”). Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Modules we supplied were primarily for multi-family housing, military and restaurant use and were manufactured by third party suppliers using our proprietary technology and design and engineering expertise, which modifies code-engineered cargo shipping containers and purpose-built modules for use for safe and sustainable commercial, industrial and residential building. With our acquisition in September 2020 of Echo DCL, LLC (“Echo”), one of our key supply chain providers, we now have more control over the manufacturing process and have increased our product offerings to add containers made out of wood.  In March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic we began increasing our focus on providing our Modules as health care facilities for deployable medical response solutions. Our partnership with Clarity Lab Solutions, LLC (“Clarity Labs”) in Miami, Florida, a CLIA-certified laboratory, has allowed us to provide laboratory testing at our Modules. In addition, to providing our Modules as emergency healthcare facilities for rapidly deployable medical response solutions and our conducting testing services at such facilities, we also distribute and sell”) GeneFinder™ COVID-19 Plus RealAmp Kit™ PCR tests pursuant to a non-exclusive distributorship agreement that we entered into with Osang Healthcare Co Ltd (“Osang”) a Republic of Korea company in April 2020.
Prior to October 2019, our business model was solely a project-based construction model pursuant to which we were responsible for the design and construction of finished products that incorporated our technology primarily to customers in the multi-family housing, restaurant, military and education industries throughout the United States. In October 2019, we changed our business model for our residential building construction to a royalty fee model and entered into a five-year exclusive license with CPF GP 2019-1 LLC (“CPF”) under which CPF licensed on an exclusive basis our proprietary technology and intellectual property to develop and commercialize products in the United States (and its territories) for residential use, including, without limitation, single-family residences and multi-family residences, but excluding military housing. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, our core customer base was comprised of architects, landowners, builders and developers who use our Modules in commercial and residential structures. Our cargo modified Modules allow for the redesign, repurpose and conversion of heavy-gauge steel cargo shipping containers into SGBlocks™, which are safe green building blocks for commercial, industrial, and residential building construction, rather than consuming new steel and lumber. Our technology and expertise is also used to purpose-build modules, or prefabricated steel modular units customized for use in modular construction (“SGPBMs” and, together with SGBlocks™, “Modules”), primarily to augment or complement an SGBlocks™ structure.

 In March 2020, we began increasing our focus on providing our Modules as health care facilities for deployable medical response solutions. In May, we entered into a partnership with  Grimshaw and Osang for deployment of our  D-Tec suite of prefabricated health facilities for on-site immediate COVID-19 testing. In September 2020, we entered the U.S. test lab market by forming a joint venture with Clarity Labs , a manufacturer and market leader of rapid diagnostic tests, to launch CLIA-certified laboratories.  Our joint venture with Clarity has allowed us to not only supply our  D-Tec suite of prefabricated health facilities but also allows us to provide testing services at such facilities . We have supplied our building modular coronavirus testing centers and provide testing services for Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), Memorial in Wayne County, Michigan and have  been selected as a Trusted Testing Partner (TTP) for Hawaii’s COVID-19 travel testing program.
  
In September 2020, we acquired substantially all the assets of Echo, a Texas limited liability company, except for Echo's real estate holdings for which we obtained a right of first refusal. Echo is a container/modular manufacturer based in Durant, Oklahoma specializing in the design and construction of permanent modular and temporary modular buildings and was one of our key supply chain partners.  Echo catered to the military, education, administration facilities, healthcare, government, commercial and residential customers. This acquisition has allowed us to expand our reach for our Modules and offers us an opportunity to vertically integrate a large portion of our cost of goods sold, as well as increase margins, productivity and efficiency in the areas of design, estimating, manufacturing and delivery. On February 24, 2021, we announced the execution of our option to acquire Echo's real estate holdings.

  License Agreement with CPF GP 2019-1 LLC

On October 3, 2019, we entered into an Exclusive License Agreement (the “License Agreement”) with CPF, which at the time was one of our customers, pursuant to which we granted CPF an exclusive license (the “License”) solely within the United States and its legal territories to commercialize our GreenSteel™ proprietary technology, intellectual property, any improvements thereto, and any related permits, in order to develop and commercialize products within the field of design and project management platforms for residential use, including, without limitation, single-family residences and multi-family residences, but excluding military housing. As a result of the License, with respect to residential construction using our GreenSteel technology (other than residential construction for the military) in the U.S., we are neither responsible for constructing the Modules that are based on our technology nor responsible for the related costs. Instead, that service is performed by CPF and its subcontractors and our revenue under the License is generated from the royalties we receive from CPF based on the gross revenue that CPF receives from sales of these products based upon our licensed technology. The License Agreement has an initial term of five (5) years, with automatic renewal provisions for subsequent five (5) year periods. The License Agreement provides for customary termination provisions, including the right by us to terminate if CPF fails to make the minimum royalty payments  described below. In addition to the exclusion for military housing, our Ridge Avenue Project (described below) was excluded from the License. Echo also produces pre-fabricated modular containers, for both residential and commercial use, using wood as the base material instead of steel containers, which activities are not subject to the License. See “Other Modular Products” below.

In consideration for the License, during the initial term, CPF agreed to pay us a royalty of (i) five percent (5%) on the first $20,000,000 of gross revenues derived from CPF’s commercialization of the License (net of customary discounts, sales taxes, delivery charges, and amounts for returns) (the “Gross Revenues”), (ii) four and one-half percent (4.5%) on the next $30,000,000 of Gross Revenues, and (iii) five percent (5%) on all Gross Revenues thereafter (collectively, the “Royalty”), subject to the following minimum royalty payments determined on a cumulative basis during the initial term: $500,000 in year 1, $750,000 in year 2, $1,500,000 in year 3, $2,000,000 in year 4, and $2,500,000 in year 5. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we did not receive any royalty payments under the License. If the License Agreement is extended beyond the initial term, then the parties have agreed to negotiate in good faith the royalty rate and the minimum royalty payments for the renewal term(s). In addition, to the extent CPF sublicenses any aspect of the License to a sublicensee, CPF will pay to us fifty percent (50%) of all payments received by CPF from such sublicensee. We may also provide CPF with professional services with respect to the License, and CPF will reimburse us for employees’ time, materials, and expenses incurred in providing such professional services. CPF also separately agreed to reimburse us for any third-party expenses incurred by us in developing our remaining and future residential projects.
 
The License Agreement provides for customary indemnification obligations between the parties and further provides that CPF will indemnify us for any claims arising out of the commercialization of the License by CPF or any of its subsidiaries, contractors, or sublicensees. In addition, the License Agreement provides that we will provide CPF with cost estimates for the fabrication and manufacturing of residential projects in our existing pipeline as of the date of the License Agreement, and if such projects cannot be reasonably constructed and installed at or below such estimates, then CPF may withhold payment of any royalty due to us under the License Agreement on a dollar-for-dollar basis to offset the costs above the originally estimated amounts.
 
On October 3, 2019, we entered into a Loan Agreement and Promissory Note (the “Loan Agreement”) with CPF GP, which was amended on October 15, 2019 and further amended on November 7, 2019 pursuant to which we agreed to loan CPF GP $750,000 at an annual interest rate of five percent (5%), with a maturity date of July 31, 2023. Under the Loan Agreement, as amended agreed to advance to CPF GP the first installment of the principal amount, equal to $500,000, no later than January 31, 2020 and the second installment of the principal amount, equal to $250,000, no later than April 15, 2020. As security for this loan, we received a security interest in all of CPF GP’s membership interests in the Licensee. If we failed to fund either principal installment, such failure would have  constituted a default under the Loan Agreement and a cross default under the License Agreement. On January 21, 2020, pursuant to the Loan Agreement, CPF GP issued to us a promissory note in the principal amount of $400,000 (the “Company Note”) and issued to Paul Galvin, our Chairman and CEO, a promissory note in the principal amount of $100,000 (the “Galvin Note”). The transaction closed on January 22, 2020, on which date we loaned CPF GP $400,000 and Mr. Galvin personally loaned CPF GP $100,000 on behalf of us. The Company Note and Galvin Note bear interest at five percent (5%) per annum, payable, together with the unpaid principal amount of the promissory notes, on the earlier of the July 31, 2023 maturity date or upon the liquidation, redemption sale or issuance of a dividend upon the LLC interests in CPF MF 2019-1 LLC, a Texas limited liability company of which CPF GP is the general partner; provided, that the terms of the Galvin Note provide that all interest payments due to Mr. Galvin under the Galvin Note shall be paid directly to, and for the benefit of, our Company.

  Distribution Agreement with Osang
 
In April 2020, we expanded our product offerings and began focusing on medical projects. On April 30, 2020, we entered in a Distributorship Agreement (as amended, the "Distributorship Agreement") with Osang, effective as of April 28, 2020, for its GeneFinderTM COVID-19 Plus RealAmp KitTM , designed to detect SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus 2), the virus that causes COVID-19, through gene-based reverse transcription reaction and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing process.  On April 30, 2020, the Distributorship Agreement was amended to provide us with certain additional warranties from Osang. The Distributorship Agreement is Osang's standard form of distributorship agreement and provides us with the non-exclusive right to distribute Osang's GeneFinder COVID-19 Plus RealAmp Kit in the United States for a stated term of one (1) year. Pursuant to the terms of the Distributorship Agreement, we are required to make payment for 100% of any purchase order prior to shipment of the product from Osang, though we do not expect to make any cash outlays with respect to any product that we distribute and expect instead to require any third-party purchasers to make the necessary cash outlays as part of a purchase order entered into with us. The Distributorship Agreement does not guarantee us a specific quantity of kits to sell or a customer list, and may be terminated by either party at any time on thirty (30) days' notice. At the end of 2020, we began sales of the GeneFinder COVID-19 Plus RealAmp Kits. To date, the Distribution Agreement has not yielded the anticipated benefits or generated significant revenue.

On October 12, 2020, we and Osang, entered into a Managed Supply Agreement (the “Supply Agreement”) relating to the consignment (the “Consignment”) to us for 180 days of two (2) million units of Osang's flagship Genefinder Plus RealAmp Covid-19 PCR Test (the “Product”) from Osang for the cold-chain storage and distribution of Product in the United States of America and Canada by us on behalf of ourself, as well as for Osang to other distributors in Territory as well as for direct sales by Osang worldwide where permissible for a period of 180 days thereafter. The Supply Agreement provides  that we have no payment obligation to Osang for the Consignment until we sell the Product and that any unsold Product will remain the responsibility of Osang, except that we are responsible for the cold-storage fees. Notwithstanding Osang’s agreement to use its best efforts to sell the Products from the Consignment with priority, to date Osang has not drawn one unit of Product from the Consignment. On April 14, 2021, we filed suit against Osang for breach of contract and fraud seeking damages in the amount of $12 to $15 million in U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of New York (CV 21-1990). See Item 3. Legal Proceedings.
 
  Joint Development Agreement with Grimshaw
 
                On May 27, 2020, we entered into a Joint Development Agreement with Grimshaw Design, LLC ("Grimshaw"). Grimshaw is engaged in architecture, planning and industrial design. Our joint agreement is to develop a prototype and "proof of concept" for a scalable, customizable and rapidly deployable medical facility with laboratory systems, testing booths, spaces for in-patient and out-patient care and/or other medical care units, based upon Grimshaw's designs and utilizing our container-based or other modular structures, or pre-fabricated modular structures jointly developed by us and Grimshaw. 
 
On July 6, 2020, we expanded our relationship with Grimshaw when we entered into another Joint Development Agreement with Grimshaw. Our joint agreement is to develop a prototype and "proof of concept" for a scalable, customizable and rapidly deployable educational facility with classrooms, spaces for teaching, workshops, dining, recreation, sports and/or other education-related purposes, based upon Grimshaw's designs and utilizing our container-cased or other modular structures, or pre-fabricated modular structures jointly developed by us and Grimshaw.
 
On November 19, 2020, we and Memorial Hospital, of Michigan (“Memorial), entered into a Professional Services and Capital Support Contract (“PSCSC”) with Wayne County, Michigan to appoint Memorial the primary contractor for the construction of portable on-site laboratory facilities for COVID-19 testing. The PSCCS engages the Company as a sub-contractor to render services and support to Memorial in connection with the fulfillment of statements of work submitted from Wayne County to Memorial. The program deploys the D-Tec Product Series, designed by Grimshaw and developed by SG Blocks, to deliver COVID-19 PCR testing and on-site CLIA lab services directly into high risk and underserved areas.  The D-Tec 1 Units  are expected to be deployed throughout Wayne County and will provide sample extraction. Clarity Mobile Venture will be the primary operator of the facility.
 
  Joint Venture with Clarity Lab Solutions, LLC
 
On August 27, 2020, we entered into a joint venture agreement (the “Clarity Mobile Venture”) with Clarity Labs, a CLIA-certified laboratory based in Miami, Florida. Under the Clarity Mobile Venture, we, along with Clarity Labs have agreed to jointly market, sell, and distribute certain lab testing products and services (“Clarity Mobile Venture”). On November 12, 2020, Clarity Mobile Venture entered into a contract with the City of Los Angeles for the operations of a COVID-19 PCR Test Laboratory at Los Angeles International Airport ("LAX") to provide a full-service modular COVID-19 laboratory and testing facility onsite at Los Angeles International Airport.   This facility conducts PCR tests with results available within three hours for passengers and airline crew, and no later than 24 hours for LAX airport employees. Additionally, other rapid coronavirus tests including antigen tests are expected to become available. Clarity Mobile Venture is the primary operator. On November 16, 2020, we announced that the State of Hawaii had selected Clarity Labs and Clarity Mobile Venture to provide COVID-19 testing and clinical laboratory at LAX for testing of passengers travelling between Los Angeles and Hawaii.
 
Acquisition of Echo DCL, LLC 
 
On September 17, 2020, we, through our wholly owned subsidiary SG Echo, entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (“Asset Purchase Agreement”) with Echo DCL, LLC, a container/modular manufacturer that had been a key supplier of ours, to acquire substantially all the assets of Echo, except for Echo's real estate holdings, for which SG Echo has obtained a right of first refusal to acquire same. On September 23, 2020, we, SG Echo and Echo completed the transactions as contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Closing”).
 
Pursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, at the Closing we paid to Echo an aggregate of $1,059,600 in cash, subject to the escrow of certain of the purchase price funds, and SG Echo agreed to pay certain of Echo’s indebtedness, including the obligation to (i) satisfy a Guidance Line of Credit loan (“GLOC Loan”) in the principal amount of approximately $616,000 ($316,432 of which payoff proceeds was delivered by SG Echo to SG DCL at the closing), (ii) pay the debt service on certain of Echo’s indebtedness in the approximate principal amount of $1.7 million for 12 months following the closing, (iii) pay the monthly principal and interest due under the BTH Credit Line in the principal amount of $500,000 for 12 months following the closing and if Seller has not fully satisfied the outstanding principal and interest due under the BTH Credit Line and caused the BTH Lender to release and terminate any Encumbrances on the Purchase Assets arising out of the BTH Credit Line, Buyer may pay the outstanding principal and interest due, and (iv) pay earn out payments equal to the net income received from the acquired business during the 3-month period beginning on the first day of the first full month that is 3 months after the closing date, the 3-month period following the first earn out period and the 3-month period following the second earn out period, payable in 50% in cash and 50% in shares of our common stock to be valued a $2.50 per share; provided, that up to approximately $300,000 of any amounts paid in respect of the GLOC Loan, and any amounts paid in respect of the debt service on Echo’s indebtedness and line of credit with BTH Bank, as described in subparagraphs (i), (ii) or (iii) above, shall be offset against and reduce the earnout payments due to Echo DCL. In no event may the number of shares of common stock to be issued to Echo exceed 19.99% of our outstanding shares on the date of the execution of the Asset Purchase Agreement. 
 
Recent Developments
 
Effective December 7, 2020, the Company appointed William B. Rogers to serve as the Company’s Chief Operations Officer. Pursuant to an offer letter signed by Mr. Rogers on November 11, 2020 (the “Offer Letter”), Mr. Rogers will receive an annual salary of $300,000 per year and an annual bonus of up to 50% of his salary at the discretion of management and the Board of Directors (the “Board”) of the Company. Mr. Rogers was issued an initial grant of 100,000 restricted stock units following a 90-day probationary period, pursuant to the SG Blocks, Inc., Stock Incentive Plan, as amended (the “Incentive Plan”) which will vest over a two-year period.

On February 17, 2021, we formed SGB Development Corp., a Delaware corporation (“SGB Dev Co”) with the express purpose of real property development utilizing our technologies. We expect SG Dev Co will be a co-developer and owner of real estate development projects that deliver apartments and homes for sale. The homes and apartments will be manufactured by SG Echo so that the project is fully integrated into the SGBX eco-system. Many of the projects will utilize the products designed and manufactured through SG Home to reduce design costs, which savings can be passed on to buyers. 
 
SGB Dev Co has announced a 225-apartment unit project known as Lago Vista on Lake Travis in booming Austin, Texas.  The land closing is scheduled for Q2 2021, and the estimated manufacturing revenue from this project alone to SG Echo is approximately $30 million dollars over 36 months. Our profit share from sales is anticipated in the range of $5 to $7 million dollars over the period the units are sold.  Each project will have a third party real estate investor and day to day Manager so that we do not need to finance projects or be distracted from manufacturing excellence. 
 
On February 24, 2021, we announced the execution of our option to acquire Echo’s real estate holdings in Durant, OK, consisting of a 19-acre site and all of its structures. We expect to close on the Echo site in the second quarter of 2021.
 
  Products Produced with Our GreenSteel™ Modular Technology
 
The building products developed with our proprietary technology and design and engineering expertise are generally stronger, more durable, environmentally sensitive, and erected in less time than traditional construction methods. The use of the SG Blocks building structure typically provides between four to six points towards the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (“LEED”) certification levels, including reduced site disturbance, resource reuse, recycled content, innovation in design and use of local and regional materials. Due to the ability of SG  Blocks to satisfy such requirements, we believe the products produced utilizing our technology and expertise is a leader in environmentally sustainable construction.
 
There are three core product offerings that utilize our involves GreenSteel technology and engineering expertise. The first product offering involves GreenSteel Modules, which are the structural core and shell of an SG Blocks building. We procure the containers, engineer required openings with structural steel enforcements, paint the containers and then deliver them on-site, where the customer or a customer’s general contractor will complete the entire finish out and installation. The second product offering involves replicating the process to create the GreenSteel product and, in addition, installing selected materials, finishes and systems (including, but not limited to floors, windows, doors, interior painting, electrical wiring and fixtures, plumbing outlets and bathrooms, roofing system) and delivering SG Blocks pre-fabricated containers to the site for a third party licensed general contractor to complete the final finish out and installation. Finally, the third product offering is the completely fabricated and finished SG Blocks building (including but not limited to floors, windows, doors, interior painting, electrical wiring and fixtures, plumbing outlets and bathrooms, roofing systems), including erecting the final unit on site and completing any other final steps. The building is ready for occupancy and/or use as soon as installation is completed. Construction administration and/or project management services are typically included in our product offerings.

Other Modular Products
 
We also produce pre-fabricated modular containers, for both residential and commercial use, at Echo using wood as the base material instead of steel containers. We have found that many clients prefer a mix of wood and steel containers for their projects, wood for aesthetics and cost-savings, and steel for stability and durability.  Since our acquisition of Echo, approximately 65% of our Module sales have been for wood-based modules. 
 
ESR Approval

In April 2017, the ICC Evaluation Service, LLC (“ICC-ES”) granted us an Evaluation Service Report (“ESR”) for the SGBlocks structural building materials. We believe we are the first modular building company to receive such certification. Our ESR indicates that the ICC-ES recognizes the suitability and technical capabilities of the SGBlocks structural building materials for use in compliance with the International Building Code and Residential Code, the California Building Code and Residential Code, and the Florida Building Code—Building and Residential. We believe our ESR has expedited reviews and approvals by state and local building departments, helped the SGBlocks concept gain wider acceptance in the construction industry and opened up licensing opportunities internationally We also believe the ESR will make it more difficult for other companies in the industry to compete with us because the quality control and design acceptance criteria are specific to us and our associated facilities.
 
Our ESR is site-specific; therefore, only the inspected and approved facilities can place the ICC-ES mark on the containers. We currently source or fabricate our SGBlocks from 18 facilities located throughout the continental United States. The ICC-ES has currently approved six of these facilities to place the ICC-ES medallion and we will seek ICC-ES approval for additional facilities on an as needed basis. Each of these facilities undergo an annual inspection by ICC-ES. Currently, each of these facilities has been re-certified by ICC-ES and is current with their recertifications. All SGBlocks manufactured at these facilities have an ESR medallion that validates the quality control process.
 
Because our ESR does not cover SGPBMs, this certification does not extend to buildings constructed using SGPBMs. 
 
  Target Markets

To date, the target markets for the products that utilize our technology and expertise have been the new construction market in the United States. The Modules that utilize our technology and expertise have a particular application in a number of segments, including:

● | Single-Family and Multi-Family Housing
--+---------------------------------------


● | Restaurants and Quick Service Restaurants
--+------------------------------------------


● | Military 
--+--------------------------
● | Education/Student Housing
● | Health Care 


● | Equipment Enclosures and Stacking Solutions
--+--------------------------------------------
● | Office and Commercial 
● | Commercial and residential customers 
● | Athletic facilities and support structures 
● | Administration Facilities 


In addition, future target markets for expansion of such products and services include data centers, warehouse/public storage, reclamation/drop off centers and medical. 

Our Competitive Strengths
 
Although the construction industry is highly competitive, we are committed to educating the real estate community on the benefits of our technology and expertise and positioning the products that utilize our technology and expertise as complementary to the strategy of developers, rather than as competition. We and CPF may compete for building opportunities with regional, national and international builders that possess greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do, and competition within the general construction industry may increase if there is future consolidation in the land development and construction industry or from new building technologies that could arise. Within the modular building space, we compete against a small number of companies providing modular-building services. The principal competitive factors in our business include, but are not limited to, the availability of building materials; technical product knowledge and expertise; previous experience in modular construction; consulting or other service capabilities; pricing of products; and the marketability of our ESR within the structural building space.

We believe we can distinguish ourselves from our competitors on the basis of our ESR, quality, cost and construction time savings when utilizing our technology and expertise. Our proprietary construction for our cargo based containers method is typically less expensive than traditional construction methods, particularly in urban locations and multi-story projects, and construction time is also generally reduced by using our construction method, reducing both construction and soft costs substantially. SGBlocks are designed to be hurricane-, tornado- and earthquake-resistant and able to withstand harsh climate conditions. The flexibility and the stack-ability of the Modules allows architects, developers and owners to design Modules to meet their specific needs. In addition, our management team has a breadth of knowledge in the modular building industry with a combined 130 years of experience. Our experience in a wide range of construction applications, including office, enclosures, residential, commercial, quick service restaurants, experiential and restaurant applications, gives us an advantage over our competition through the use of market-based prototypes.

With the acquisition of Echo, we have been able to vertically integrate our manufacturing process and reduce some of our cost of goods sold, productivity and efficiency.

Our Customers
 
We market our construction products to a broad customer base, comprised primarily of contractors, home builders, building owners and other resellers across the continental United States and we also market our services and technology to customers in Canada.   In addition, as stated above, we now also supply our Modules to the medical community. SG Blocks customers come from all walks in the economy and include government agencies, private developers, the U.S. Military, the Native American Community, the QSR operators, individuals and families requiring COVID-19 tests and a host of entrepreneurs looking to launch ideas and technology. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, 79% and 92%, respectively, of the Company’s gross accounts receivable were due from three and one customers. Revenue relating to three and two customers represented approximately 61% and 78% of the Company’s total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 
Our Suppliers and Partners
 
Although the primary use of shipping containers is for transportation, when constructing SGBlocks we use standard materials to modify the container shell structure and finish out the modules. We utilize the same suppliers and materials used by conventional construction. Materials such as windows, doors, insulation mechanical systems, electrical systems and other such supplies are all off-the-shelf materials and equipment commonly available and used in the industry.

One of the main suppliers for the procurement of our containers is ConGlobal Industries, Inc. (“ConGlobal”), an independent third party, with whom we have an exclusive 10-year Collaboration and Supply Agreement (the “ConGlobal Agreement”) through May 14, 2024. ConGlobal is one of the largest depot operators in the United States. This arrangement provides us with a reliable source of supply of certified shipping containers. The ConGlobal Agreement provides that ConGlobal will be our exclusive supplier of SGBlocks for housing, office and retail uses generally constructed as permanent structures within the continental United States within a 50 mile radius of an existing ConGlobal site and ConGlobal will not supply shipping containers modified for building purposes to any entity competing with us during the term of the agreement. The Company believes it has access to alternative suppliers, with limited disruption to the business, should circumstances change with its existing suppliers.
 
  Intellectual Property
 
We operate under our United States registered trademarks “SGBlocks” and “GreenSteel” and our trademarked “SG” logo.  
 
Government Regulation and Approval
 
The design and construction of buildings is controlled at the project level, with local and state municipalities having jurisdiction in most cases. All buildings, conventionally built or modularly built, are subject to published building codes and criteria that must be achieved during the architectural and engineering phase in order to be approved for construction. There are no specific regulations that impact our technology. While much of the regulation in our industry occurs at the project level, we are subject to various federal, state and local government regulations applicable to the business in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including laws and regulations relating to our relationships with our employees, public health and safety, workplace safety, transportation, zoning and fire codes. We strive to operate in accordance with applicable laws, codes and regulations. We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with existing applicable environmental laws and regulations and, in addition, that our employment, workplace health and workplace safety practices comply with related regulations.

On June 30, 2016 (the “Effective Date”), the Plan became effective and the Debtors emerged from bankruptcy.

Prior to the Effective Date, SGB was authorized to issue: (i) 300,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 (the “Former Common Stock”) of which 42,918,927 shares were issued and outstanding as of June 29, 2016; and (ii) 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 (the “Former Preferred Stock”), none of which were issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Date.
 
On the Effective Date, and pursuant to the terms of the Plan, SGB entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement, dated June 30, 2016, pursuant to which SGB sold for a subscription price of $2.0 million a 12% Original Issue Discount Senior Secured Convertible Debenture to Hillair Capital Investments L.P. (“HCI”) in the principal amount of $2.5 million, with a maturity date of June 30, 2018 (the “Exit Facility”). 
 
On the Effective Date, all previously issued and outstanding shares of the Former Common Stock were deemed discharged, cancelled and extinguished, and, pursuant to the Plan, SGB issued, in the aggregate, 8,195 shares (as adjusted to effect a 1-for-20 reverse stock split) of common stock, par value $0.01 (the “New Common Stock”), to the holders of Former Common Stock. Further, under the Plan, upon the Effective Date, certain members of SGB’s management were entitled to receive options (the “Management Options”) to acquire approximately 10,919 shares (as adjusted to effect a 1-for-20 reverse stock split), of SGB’s New Common Stock, on a fully diluted basis.
 
  
On the Effective Date, pursuant to the terms of the Plan and SGB’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, SGB filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a Certificate of Designations of Convertible Preferred Stock, designating 1,801,670 shares (as adjusted to effect a 1-for-3 reverse stock split) of preferred stock, par value $1.00, all of which were issued upon our emergence from bankruptcy. Prior to our public offering that we consummated in June 2017, all outstanding shares of our preferred stock, were converted into 90,084 shares of common stock. No preferred stock currently remains outstanding.
 
Reverse Stock Split

All share and per share amounts set forth in the consolidated financial statements have been retroactively restated to reflect the split effected in February 2020 as if it had occurred as of the earliest period presented and unless otherwise stated, all other share and per share amounts for all periods presented in this Annual Report have been adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split effected in February 2020.  
Recent Financing Developments 
 
In April 2020, we completed a public offering of common stock (the "April Public Offering"). In connection with the April Public Offering, we sold 440,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $4.25 per share, resulting in aggregate net proceeds of approximately $1,522,339 after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other expenses related to the offering. We incurred a total of approximately $347,661 in issuance costs in connection with the offering and no warrants to purchase were issued to the underwriters. 
 
In May 2020, we completed a public offering of common stock (the "May Public Offering"). In connection with the May Public Offering, we sold 6,000,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $2.50 per share. Pursuant to the terms of the related Underwriting Agreement dated May 6, 2020 by and among the Company and ThinkEquity, a division of Fordham Financial Management, Inc., as representatives of several underwriters named therein ("ThinkEquity"), ThinkEquity was granted an over-allotment option to purchase up to an additional 900,000 shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Common Stock"), in connection with the previously announced public offering. On May 15, 2020, ThinkEquity exercised in full such option with respect to all 900,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock (the "Option Shares"). After giving effect to the full exercise of the over-allotment option, the total number of shares of Common Stock sold by us in the May Public Offering was 6,900,000 shares of Common Stock and total net proceeds to us, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses payable by us, were approximately $15,596,141. We incurred a total of approximately $1,653,859 in issuance costs in connection with the offering and issued warrants to purchase 300,000 shares of common stock to the underwriters.
