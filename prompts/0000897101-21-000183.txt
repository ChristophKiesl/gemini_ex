Market Overview:

Intricon serves as a JDM to leading medical device OEMs by designing, developing, engineering, manufacturing and distributing micromedical products, microelectronics, micro-mechanical assemblies, complete assemblies and software solutions. Revenue from these markets is reported on the respective diabetes, other medical, hearing health value based direct-to-end-consumer, hearing health value based indirect-to-end-consumer, hearing health legacy OEM, and professional audio lines in the discussion of our results of operations in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 23 “Revenue by Market” to the Company’s consolidated financial statements included herein.

The Company manufactures microelectronics, micro-mechanical assemblies, high-precision injection-molded plastic components and complete body-worn devices for leading and emerging medical device manufacturers. Intricon currently serves this market by offering medical device manufacturers the capabilities to design, develop, manufacture, package and distribute medical devices that are easier to use, smaller, lighter and use less power. Increasingly, the medical device industry is looking to outsource the manufacturing, assembly and packaging of their products.

The Company is committed to increasing investments to support its medical business development efforts. In early 2019, the Company hired a vice president of medical business development, and in connection with the EMS acquisition, has engaged one of the former owners of EMS as a corporate development consultant in an effort to leverage our core competencies and diversify our medical revenue base. The Company believes it has significant opportunities to serve the emerging home care markets through its already developed core competencies and capabilities to develop devices that are more technologically advanced, smaller and lightweight. 

Diabetes
Intricon currently has a strong presence in the diabetes market by working with Medtronic to manufacture their wireless continuous glucose monitors (CGM), sensor assemblies, and accessories associated with Medtronic’s insulin pump and CGM system. In September 2016, the FDA approved Medtronic’s current generation insulin pump system, the MiniMed 670G system. The MiniMed 670G was the world’s first hybrid closed loop insulin delivery system. In September 2020, Medtronic announced FDA approval for the MiniMed 770G Insulin Pump System with smartphone connectivity. This latest system by Medtronic expands the benefits of hybrid closed loop therapy to younger children living with type 1 diabetes and makes it easier to access and share real-time CGM and pump data. The system will enable caregivers to see user data remotely on their smartphones, with proactive in-app notices sent when glucose levels are out of range. The data can also be shared automatically with clinicians and educators to help facilitate more effective telehealth visits and product trainings. This connectivity also gives Medtronic the ability to provide upgrades to future technology via software updates which will enhance device features. The Company is excited that our components are designed into and support such a revolutionary diabetes management system. Looking ahead, the Company believes there are opportunities to expand our diabetes product offering with Medtronic, as well as move into new markets outside of the diabetes market.
Peripheral Vascular, Interventional Pulmonology and Electrophysiology
Intricon has a suite of micro-coil technology that it offers to various OEM customers. These products are currently used in surgical navigation clinical applications, such as interventional pulmonology and electrophysiology. On May 18, 2020, Intricon acquired EMS, which provides joint engineering and manufacturing services for complex medical devices, including catheters covering a range of applications for cardiology, peripheral vascular, neurology, radiology and pulmonology. EMS’s production capability consists of design, development, manufacturing, testing and non-sterile packaging services. The acquisition expands Intricon’s micro-coil capabilities, including the ability to offer complete full-length catheter-based devices in surgical navigation and accelerates diversification into potential new end-markets.
Drug Delivery 
Intricon manufactures bubble sensors and flow restrictors that monitor and control the flow of fluid in an intravenous infusion system. In addition, Intricon has automated the production of a family of safety needle products for an OEM customer that utilizes Intricon’s insert and precision miniature molding capabilities. These products are assembled using full automation, including built-in quality checks within the production lines.
Value-Based Hearing Healthcare
In the United States alone, there are approximately 40 million adults that report some degree of hearing loss. It is estimated that hearing aids can help more than 90 percent of people with hearing loss, however the current market penetration into the U.S. hearing-impaired population is approximately 20 percent, a percentage that has remained essentially unchanged for the last four decades. The primary deterrents to greater penetration are cost and access. Along with this, the legacy hearing aid distribution channel is made up of five large hearing aid manufacturers who utilize brick-and-mortar and licensed audiologists to sell devices while controlling the channel dynamics. As a result, the average cost of a hearing aid sold in the US market today is over $2,400 per device, more than double the cost from fifteen years ago. Approximately 70 percent of the hearing-impaired have hearing loss in both ears (referred to as a binaural loss), driving the total cost to almost $5,000 on average for a set of hearing aids.

 




The Company believe several factors have come together over the last few years to enable the emergence of a market disruptive, high-quality, low-cost distribution model. These factors include the continued consolidation of retail (causing escalating hearing aid prices), consumer outcry, consumer education, advancements in technology (such as behind-the-ear devices, advanced digital signal processing, low-power wireless, and self-fitting software) and pending regulatory change to allow the sale of over-the-counter (“OTC”) hearing aids. 

The Company believes the value-based hearing healthcare (VBHH) market offers significant growth opportunities. To best approach this market opportunity, the Company has sharpened its focus to identify potential high-profile branding partners that value Intricon’s ability to deliver superior hearing aids, self-fitting software and customer care to the U.S. market.

Legacy OEM Hearing Health Channel
The Company also believes there are niches in the legacy hearing health channel that will embrace outcomes-based products and technologies in the United States and Europe. High costs of legacy devices and retail consolidation have constrained the growth potential of the independent audiologist and dispenser. Intricon believes its specific software and product offering can provide independent audiologists and dispensers the ability to compete with larger retailers, and manufacturer owned retail distributors.
Professional Audio Communications
Intricon entered the high-quality audio communication device market in 2001, and now has a line of miniature, professional audio headset products used by customers focused on emergency response needs and military applications. The line includes several communication devices that are extremely portable and perform well in noisy and/or hazardous environments. These products are well suited for applications in the fire, law enforcement, safety, aviation and military markets. In addition, the Company has a line of miniature ear- and head-worn devices used by performers and support staff in the music and stage performance markets.
Core Technical Capabilities Overview:

Over the past several years, the Company has increased investments in the continued development of critical core competencies, including micro-coil winding and assembly, microelectronics assembly, interventional catheter assembly, precision miniature molding, ultra-low power (ULP) digital signal processing (DSP) and wireless communications, as well as self-fitting software for hearing health. These core competencies serve as the foundation of current and future product platform development. While our core competencies are impressive individually, the Company believes that its differentiating value proposition is its ability to integrate various competencies into innovative solutions for challenging clinical applications.
Micro-coil Winding and Assembly
Electromagnetic micro-coils are a core technical capability at Intricon. Working with a complete range of ultra-fine wires and ferromagnetic core materials, we use our proprietary modeling and engineering systems to design and produce micro-coils that meet electromagnetic goals such as induction, resistance, sensitivity and localization performance. We also routinely work within size constraints dictated by the design of the medical device, utilizing our capabilities of winding down to 58 AWG wire (.00991 mm or .00039 inches), about one-third the diameter of a human hair. Finished micro-coils often are small enough to fit through the eye of a needle.

Bonding the coil wire to slightly larger diameter wire (often a twisted pair that runs the length of the device), provides full-length connectivity. Intricon can also assemble the entire device, and many of these programs include embedded ROM chips that calibrate the location of the micro-coil within the finished device so that the device can plug in directly to the navigational systems used by physicians. Today, our micro-coils are used in a wide range of medical applications in tip location sensing such as diagnostic applications, active implants and therapeutic applications such as electrophysiology atrial fibrillation (AF) mapping and ablation.
Microelectronics Assembly 
Intricon has decades of experience in microelectronics design and assembly combined with a focus on joint development manufacturing. Our engineers work with our business partners to guide designs to ensure the highest performance and manufacturability. Intricon has state-of-the-art high-speed surface mount technology (SMT) pick-and-place machines to populate flex circuits and/or printed circuit boards. Automated computer-controlled testing equipment is used to download programs and perform electrical testing to verify that all requirements are met. Both proprietary automation equipment and low-cost/highly-skilled hand assembly are available at our facilities in the United States, Singapore and Indonesia.
Interventional Catheters
Intricon provides expertise and capabilities in advanced catheter and delivery systems and extrusion to support state-of-the-art, minimally invasive clinical procedures. Expertise includes tight tolerance, thin wall extrusions, braided and coiled catheter shafts with deflectable tip options while working with a full range of high-performance materials.

 



Full-length connectivity and fine wire bonding bring to life new and unique interventional devices that can be embedded with a range of sensors, electromagnetic micro-coils or various microchips at the distal tip. Intricon also packages and ships fully-assembled devices. Clinical applications for Intricon interventional catheters and delivery systems include cardiology, peripheral vascular, neurovascular, oncology, structural heart and more.
Precision Miniature Molding
Intricon has decades of experience in precision miniature medical molding and routinely achieves tolerances of ±.0005 inches in compliance with ASTM and Society of the Plastics Industry (SPI) standards, while utilizing scientific injection molding practices. Intricon works with a broad range of materials such as polyether ether ketone, nylon, polypropylene, liquid crystal polymer, acrylic, polyoxymethylene, polycarbonate and other materials. Intricon has particular expertise with insert-molding techniques which are often employed to reduce human error and lower labor costs compared to manual assembly.

ULP DSP and Wireless Communication 
With more than 20 years of experience designing and manufacturing components and devices for hearing health, electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring patches and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), Intricon is at the forefront of digital signal processing and wireless communications solutions that use industry-standard protocols like Bluetooth® and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) as well as proprietary wireless technologies developed by Intricon.

Self-Fitting Software 
The ability to efficiently and effectively “fit” hearing aids to an individual patient’s hearing loss is critical to building a value based eco-system of hearing healthcare. By developing more advanced fitting software systems, individuals can benefit from fittings that conform to their specific loss, while eliminating the need for an in-person appointment. In addition to the traditional fitting software (AccuFit, used in the conventional channel), Intricon has made significant investments in various advanced fitting software solutions, including its purchase of the source code for the Sentibo Smart Brain self-fitting software, that can enable remote and self-fitting solutions. Intricon believes these advanced fitting solutions, along with the other components of the eco-system, will drive access, affordability and superior customer satisfaction to the millions of individuals that cannot receive care today, primarily due to high cost and low access. 

Market Development:

Intricon intends to allocate more capital and resources in marketing and sales to increase revenue by leveraging its existing core competencies and technologies platforms in order to accelerate the diversification of its revenue base within its core markets of diabetes, peripheral vascular, interventional pulmonology, electrophysiology and hearing healthcare. In addition, the Company believes this will allow it to advance its technology portfolio, advance new product platforms, and strengthen its position as a leading JDM.

The Company is committed to increasing investments to support its medical business development efforts. In early 2019, the Company hired a vice president of medical business development, and in connection with the EMS acquisition, has engaged one of the former owners of EMS as a corporate development consultant in an effort to leverage our core competencies and diversify our medical revenue base.

Currently, Intricon sells some of its hearing device products directly to domestic hearing instrument manufacturers, and distributors and partnerships through an internal sales force. As a result of the investments in Hearing Help Express in 2016 and 2017, the Company began marketing and selling hearing aid devices directly to consumers through direct mail advertising, internet and a call center. In February 2020, however, the Company announced its decision to pivot its Hearing Help Express focus entirely towards supporting product development and testing in order to best capture the near-term benefits. As a result of this re-positioning, the advertising and marketing budget related to Hearing Help Express has decreased significantly in 2020. Sales of other medical and professional audio communications products are also made primarily through an internal sales force.

Internationally, sales representatives employed by Intricon GmbH, a wholly-owned German subsidiary, solicit sales from European hearing instrument, medical device and professional audio communications manufacturers and suppliers. 

Intricon markets its high-performance microphone products to the radio communication and professional audio industries and has several larger competitors who have greater financial resources. Intricon holds a small market share in the global market for microphone capsules and other related products.

Product Liability. As a supplier of consumer and medical products and parts, Intricon is subject to claims for personal injuries allegedly caused by its products. The Company maintains what it believes to be adequate insurance coverage.
‎

‎





Regulation. Most, if not all, of our business operates in marketplaces subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA, by comparable agencies in foreign countries and other regulatory agencies. In the United States, the FDA regulates the design control, development, manufacturing, labeling, record keeping, distribution, installation, service and post-market surveillance procedures for medical devices. 


United States Food and Drug Administration 

FDA regulations classify medical devices based on intended use and perceived risk to public health as either Class I, II or III devices. Class I devices are subject to general controls, Class II devices are subject to special controls and Class III devices are subject to special controls and pre-market approval (“PMA”) requirements. While most Class I devices are exempt from pre-market submission, it is necessary for most Class II devices to be cleared by a 510(k) pre-market notification prior to marketing. A “cleared” 510(k) establishes that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a predicate device which was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 or which itself has been found to be substantially equivalent, through the 510(k) process, after May 28, 1976. It is “substantially equivalent” if it has the same intended use and the same technological characteristics as the predicate. The 510(k) pre-market notification must be supported by data establishing the claim of substantial equivalence to the satisfaction of the FDA. The FDA has 90 days to complete the review of a 510(k) submission, and clearance is typically granted within four months, however obtaining a 510(k) clearance can sometimes take significantly longer. If the product is notably new or different and substantial equivalence cannot be established, the FDA will require the manufacturer to submit a PMA application for a Class III device that must be reviewed and approved by the FDA prior to sale and marketing of the device in the United States. The process of obtaining PMA approval can be expensive, uncertain, lengthy and frequently requires anywhere from one to several years from the date of FDA submission, if approval is obtained at all. A “De Novo” application may be submitted for a new type of Class II device for which there is no predicate. The FDA controls the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed and strictly prohibits the marketing of medical devices for unapproved uses. The FDA can require the manufacturer to withdraw products from the market for failure to comply with laws or the occurrence of safety risks. 

Our facilities are subject to FDA inspection on a routine basis. The Company is required to adhere to the Current Good Manufacturing Practices (“GMP”) requirements set forth in the Quality System Regulations published by the FDA, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow design, testing, control, documentation and quality procedures during the manufacturing process.

Intricon’s wireless and non-wireless hearing aids are air-conduction devices and, as such, are Class I and Class II medical devices. Air-conduction hearing aids are exempt from the 510(k) pre-market notification process. These hearing aids may be marketed either through distribution channels owned, in whole or in part, by Intricon or through non-affiliated distribution channels. In the latter sense, Intricon acts as the contract manufacturer to the distributing organization, assisting in design, development and manufacturing. The Company’s manufacturing operations are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA, whose primary purpose is to ensure the Company’s compliance with the Quality System Regulations published by the FDA and other applicable government standards. Strict regulatory action may be initiated in response to identified deficiencies or to product performance problems. Intricon believes that our Quality Management Systems and all regulated operations are in compliance with the requirements of the FDA regulations. Our most recent FDA inspection was conducted in May of 2019. No issues (observations) arising from this inspection were noted. 

International Regulation

International regulatory bodies have established varying regulations governing product standards, packaging and labeling requirements, import restrictions, tariff regulations, duties and tax. Many of these regulations are similar to those of the FDA. The Company believes it is in compliance with the regulatory requirements in the foreign countries in which our medical devices are marketed, as evidenced by our continuous certification to the ISO 13485 granted by our notified body, British Standards Institution (BSI). A notified body is an organization designated by a European Union (EU) country to assess the conformity of certain products before being placed on the market.

Medical device law in the EU requires that our quality management system conforms to international quality standards and that our medical devices conform to “essential requirements” set forth by the Medical Device Directive (“MDD”). In order to keep pace with accelerating technical reality and manufacturing risks, medical device law in the EU is changing rapidly. Effective May 5, 2017, the MDD has been replaced with a broader, more reaching Medical Device Regulation (“MDR”) with a four-year transition period and comes into effect on May 26, 2021. Intricon intends to comply with the MDR prior to the end of the transition period.

Intricon manufacturing facilities are audited at least annually by an International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) registrar to verify conformity of its quality management systems and products to the relevant standards and regulations. The ISO registrar for our US facilities is BSI while the registrar for our Asian facilities is SGS United Kingdom Ltd. 
‎





Technical documentation, including the essential requirements matrix, for each product placed on the market in the EU is audited by our European notified body (also BSI). Successful audits verify conformance to the essential requirements set forth by the MDD for the class of medical devices produced and result in a CE certificate. This entitles us to place the “CE” mark on our devices sold and distributed in Europe. In 2014, Intricon obtained "CE" certification for our own hearing aid devices and we are supplying these devices into the European market. Intricon’s hearing aids may also bear the CE mark of our customers who then assume regulatory responsibilities for those devices they place on the EU market under their own name. 

Our European authorized representative, CE Partner 4U, reviews and retains our technical documentation and registers our products as required with applicable authorities in all EU member states. CE Partner 4U also advises Intricon of any changes to relevant laws that will impact the marketability of our products. In addition, CE Partner 4U aids Intricon in conducting required post-market surveillance activities for our products sold and distributed in the EU.

Data Privacy and Security Law
The Company is subject to domestic and foreign data privacy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls as a result of accessing and processing confidential, personal, and/or sensitive data. Our failure to comply with these laws or significant changes in the laws could significantly impact our business and our future business plans.
