Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

 
Rennova Health, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, “Rennova”, “we” or the “Company”) is a provider of an expanding group of health care services for healthcare providers, their patients and individuals. Historically, we have operated our business under one management team, but beginning in 2017, the Company intends to operate in four synergistic divisions with specialized management: 1) Clinical diagnostics through its clinical laboratories; 2) supportive software solutions to healthcare providers including Electronic Health Records (“EHR”), Laboratory Information Systems and Medical Billing services; 3) Decision support and interpretation of cancer and genomic diagnostics; and 4) the recent addition of a hospital in Tennessee. We believe that our approach will produce a more sustainable relationship and the capture of multiple revenue streams from medical providers.
 
Historically, we have specialized in providing urine and blood drug toxicology and pain medication testing to physicians, clinics and rehabilitation facilities in the United States. We intend to expand our business operations in each sector in which we focus and will continue to assess the best way to do so. We may consider the sale of or spin-off of one or more of our business operations if deemed to be the best way to create value for our shareholders.
 
History and Development of the Company
 
Medytox Solutions, Inc. (“Medytox”) was organized on July 20, 2005 under the laws of the State of Nevada. In the first half of 2011, Medytox’s management elected to reorganize as a holding company, and Medytox established and acquired a number of companies in the medical service sector between 2011 and 2014.
 
On November 2, 2015, pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of April 15, 2015, by and among CollabRx, Inc. (“CollabRx”), CollabRx Merger Sub, Inc. (“Merger Sub”), a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of CollabRx formed for the purpose of the merger, and Medytox, Merger Sub merged with and into Medytox, with Medytox as the surviving company and a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of CollabRx (the “Merger”). Prior to closing, the Company amended its certificate of incorporation to effect a 1-for-10 reverse stock split and to change its name to Rennova Health, Inc. In connection with the Merger, (i) each share of common stock of Medytox was converted into the right to receive 0.4096 shares of common stock of the Company, (ii) each share of Series B Preferred Stock of Medytox was converted into the right to receive one share of a newly-authorized Series B Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company, and (iii) each share of Series E Convertible Preferred Stock of Medytox was converted into the right to receive one share of a newly-authorized Series E Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company. This transaction was accounted for as a reverse merger in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and, as such, the historical financial statements of Medytox became the historical financial statements of the Company.
 
Holders of Company equity prior to the closing of the Merger (including all outstanding Company common stock and all restricted stock units, options and warrants exercisable for shares of Company common stock) held 10% of the Company’s common stock immediately following the closing of the Merger, and holders of Medytox equity prior to the closing of the Merger (including all outstanding Medytox common stock and all outstanding options exercisable for shares of Medytox common stock, but less certain options that were cancelled upon the closing pursuant to agreements between Medytox and such optionees) held 90% of the Company’s common stock immediately following the closing of the Merger, in each case on a fully diluted basis, provided, however, outstanding shares of the newly-designated Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and Series E Convertible Preferred Stock, certain outstanding convertible promissory notes exercisable for Company common stock after the closing and certain option grants expected to be made following the closing of the Merger are excluded from such ownership percentages.
 
On November 3, 2015, the common stock of Rennova Health, Inc. commenced trading on The NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol “RNVA.” Prior to that date, our common stock was listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol “CLRX.” Immediately after the consummation of the Merger, the Company had 13,750,010 shares of common stock, 5,000 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock and 45,000 shares of Series E Convertible Preferred Stock issued and outstanding.
 
Recent Developments
 
On April 9, 2017, Robert Lee and Dr. Paul Billings resigned from our Board of Directors. Mr. Lee and Dr. Billings were the two independent directors and were members of the Audit, Compensation and Nominating/Corporate Governance Committees of the Board. On April 9, 2017, the remaining members of the Board elected Trevor Langley and Dr. Kamran Ajami as directors to fill those two Board vacancies. The Board of Directors determined that both of the new directors qualify as “independent” under the Listing Rules of The NASDAQ Stock Market and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
Trevor Langley, 55, since 1997 has been the Owner and Managing Partner of Avanti Capital Group LLC/Avanti Partners LLC (“Avanti”). Avanti assists micro, small and mid-cap publicly traded companies and those looking to become public by leveraging traditional and new communication strategies, with a specialization in healthcare and alternative energy markets.  Avanti also provides comprehensive consulting services.
 
Dr. Kamran Ajami, 58, is a pathologist and, since February 2011, has been the Medical Director of the laboratories at West Side Regional Medical Center and Plantation General Hospital. Since 1997, he has also been Owner and Chief Executive Officer of American Cytopathology Associates PA, which supplies medical directors for laboratories. 
 
The Board named Mr. Langley and Dr. Ajami as members of the Audit Committee, with Mr. Langley as Chairman.  In addition to each of them being “independent”, the Board of Directors determined that each of them is “financially literate” as required by the Listing Rules of The NASDAQ Stock Market and that Mr. Langley qualifies as an “audit committee financial expert” as defined by the rules and regulations of the SEC and meets the qualifications of “financial sophistication” under the Listing Rules of The NASDAQ Stock Market. The Board named Mr. Langley and Dr. Ajami also as members of the Compensation Committee (with Mr. Langley as Chairman) and of the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee (with Dr. Ajami as Chairman).
 
On March 21, 2017, we closed an offering of $10,850,000 principal amount of Senior Secured Original Issue Discount Convertible Debentures due March 21, 2019 (the “New Debentures”) and three series of warrants to purchase an aggregate of 19,608,426 shares of common stock, as further described below (each a “Warrant” and, collectively, the “Warrants”). The offering was pursuant to the terms of the Securities Purchase Agreement, dated as of March 15, 2017 (the “Purchase Agreement”), between the Company and certain existing institutional investors of the Company. The Company received proceeds of approximately $8.4 million from the offering, after giving effect to the original issue discounts and transaction expenses. The net proceeds were used to pay down certain related party and other indebtedness (see “Liquidity and Corporate Reserves”) and for general corporate purposes.

Also on March 21, 2017, we closed an exchange by which the holders of the Company’s Original Issue Discount Convertible Debentures issued on February 2, 2017 and holders of the Company’s Series H Convertible Preferred Stock exchanged $1,590,000 principal amount of such debentures and $2,174,000 stated value of such preferred stock for $5,160,260 principal amount of new debentures on the same items as, and pari passu with, the New Debentures (the “Exchange Debentures” and, together with the New Debentures, the “Debentures”) and Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 9,325,773 shares of common stock. All issuance amounts of Debentures reflect a 24% original issue discount.
 
The Debentures are convertible at any time at an initial conversion price of $1.66. The New Debentures begin to amortize monthly commencing on the 90th day following March 21, 2017 and the Exchange Debentures begin to amortize monthly immediately. On each monthly amortization date, the Company may elect to repay 5% of the original principal amount of Debentures in cash or, in lieu thereof, the conversion price of such Debentures shall thereafter be 85% of the volume weighted average price at the time of conversion. In the event the Company does not elect to pay such amortization amounts in cash, each investor, in their sole discretion, may increase the conversion amount subject to the alternative conversion price by up to four times the amortization amount. The Debentures contain customary affirmative and negative covenants. The conversion price is subject to reset in the event of offerings or other issuances of common stock, or rights to purchase common stock, at a price below the then conversion price, as well as other customary antidilution protections.
 
The Series A Warrants are exercisable for up to a number of shares of Common Stock equal to 100% of the shares underlying the Debentures, or an aggregate of 9,644,736 shares. They are immediately exercisable and have a term of exercise equal to five years. The Series B Warrants are exercisable for up to a number of shares of Common Stock equal to 100% of the shares underlying the Debentures, or an aggregate of 9,644,736 shares, and are exercisable for a period of 18 months commencing immediately. The Series C Warrants are exercisable for up to a number of shares of Common Stock equal to 100% of the shares underlying the Debentures, or an aggregate of 9,644,736 shares, and have a term of five years provided such Warrants shall only vest if, when and to the extent that the holders exercise the Series B Warrants. The Series A and Series C Warrants each have an exercise price of $1.95 and the Series B Warrants have an exercise price of $1.66. The exercise price of all Warrants is subject to reset in the event of offerings or other issuances of common stock, or rights to purchase common stock, at a price below the then exercise price, as well as other customary anti-dilution protections.
 
Holders of Debentures and Warrants are prohibited from converting or exercising such Debentures or Warrants into or for Common Stock if, as a result of such conversion or exercise, the holder, together with its affiliates, would own more than 4.99% of the total number of shares of Common Stock then issued and outstanding. However, any holder may increase or decrease such percentage to any other percentage not in excess of 9.99%, provided that any increase in such percentage shall not be effective until 61 days after notice to the Company.
 
The Company is obligated to file a registration statement registering for resale the shares underlying the Debentures and Warrants on or before April 7, 2017 and use best efforts to cause such registration statement to be declared effective within 45 days or 75 days if reviewed. Additionally, the Company is required to seek stockholder approval to issue in excess of 20% of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock. The holders were also granted a right of participation in up to 50% of any future offerings for so long as the Debentures and Warrants are outstanding.
 
On February 7, 2017, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation to effect a 1-for-30 reverse stock split of the Company’s shares of common stock effective on February 22, 2017 (the “Reverse Stock Split”). The stockholders of the Company had previously approved, on December 22, 2016, an amendment to the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation to effect a reverse split of all of the Company’s shares of common stock at a specific ratio within a range from 1-for-10 to 1-for-30, and granted authorization to the Board of Directors to determine in its discretion the specific ratio and timing of the reverse split prior to December 31, 2017.
 
As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, every 30 shares of the Company’s then outstanding common stock was combined and reclassified into one share of the Company’s common stock. Proportionate voting rights and other rights of common stockholders were not affected by the Reverse Stock Split, other than as a result of the rounding up of fractional shares. Stockholders who would have otherwise held a fractional share of common stock had their holdings rounded up to the nearest full share, as no fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split.

The reverse stock split became effective at the close of business on February 22, 2017 and our common stock began trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market on a post-split basis on February 23, 2017. The par value and other terms of the common stock were not affected by the Reverse Stock Split. The authorized capital of the Company of 500,000,000 shares of common stock and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock were also unaffected by the Reverse Stock Split. All outstanding preferred shares, stock options, warrants, convertible notes and equity incentive plans immediately prior to the Reverse Stock Split were adjusted by dividing the number of shares of common stock into which the preferred shares, stock options, warrants, notes and equity incentive plans of the common stock were exercisable or convertible by 30 and multiplying the exercise or conversion price by 30. All share and per share amounts discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been retroactively restated to give effect to the Reverse Stock Split.
 
On January 13, 2017, we closed on an asset purchase agreement to acquire certain assets related to Scott County Community Hospital, based in Oneida, Tennessee (the “Hospital Assets”). The Hospital Assets include a 52,000 square foot hospital building and 6,300 square foot professional building on approximately 4.3 acres. Scott County Community Hospital is classified as a Critical Access Hospital (rural) with 25 beds, a 24/7 emergency department, operating rooms and a laboratory that provides a range of diagnostic services. Scott County Community Hospital closed in July 2016 in connection with the bankruptcy filing of its parent company, Pioneer Health Services, Inc. We acquired the Hospital Assets out of bankruptcy for a purchase price of $1.0 million. We expect to have the hospital open in part in the second quarter of 2017, and that the hospital will be fully operational by the third quarter of 2017, in each case, subject to the receipt of the necessary licenses and regulatory approvals.
 
On January 11, 2017, we were notified by Nasdaq that we no longer comply with Nasdaq's audit committee requirements as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605 (the "Rule"), which requires the audit committee of the Company's Board of Directors to have at least three members, each of whom must be independent directors as defined under the Rule. With the passing of one of our directors, Benjamin Frank, in December of 2016, our audit committee currently consists of two independent directors. In accordance with Nasdaq Rule 5605(c)(4), we have until the earlier of our next annual shareholders' meeting or December 18, 2017 to regain compliance; or, if our next annual shareholders' meeting is held before June 16, 2017, then we must evidence compliance no later than June 16, 2017. If we do not regain compliance by the foregoing applicable dates, then Nasdaq will provide written notification to us that our securities will be delisted.
 
Our Services
 
We are a healthcare enterprise that delivers products and services to healthcare providers, their patients and individuals. Historically, we have operated our business under one management team, but beginning in 2017, we intend to operate in four synergistic divisions with specialized management: 1) Clinical diagnostics through our clinical laboratories; 2) supportive software solutions to healthcare providers including Electronic Health Records (“EHR”), Laboratory Information Systems and Medical Billing services; 3) Decision support and interpretation of cancer and genomic diagnostics; and 4) the recent addition of a hospital in Tennessee. We aspire to create a more sustainable relationship with our customers by offering needed and interoperable solutions to capture multiple revenue streams from medical providers.
Clinical Diagnostics
 
Our principal line of business over the past few years has been clinical laboratory blood and urine testing services, with a particular emphasis on the provision of urine drug toxicology testing to physicians, clinics and rehabilitation facilities in the United States. As we expand our customer base to include pain management and other healthcare providers, testing services to rehabilitation facilities represented approximately 75% of the Company’s revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 and approximately 95% of the Company’s revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. We believe that we are responding to the challenges faced by today’s healthcare providers to adopt paper free and interoperable systems, and to market demand for solutions by strategically expanding our offering of diagnostics services to include a full suite of clinical laboratory services. The drug and alcohol rehabilitation and pain management sectors provide an existing and sizable target market, where the need for our services already exists and opportunity is being created by a continued secular growth and need for compliance.

In 2016 we added genetic testing, specifically pharmacogenetic testing, to our array of services. Genetic testing represents the most rapidly expanding segment of the diagnostics market worldwide. Growing incidence of genetic diseases presents new opportunities for genetic testing. According to a report issued by Global Industry Analysts, Inc., the global market for genetic testing is forecast to reach $2.2 billion by 2017. Increasing knowledge about the potential benefits of genetic testing is one of the prime reasons for the growth of the market. Advancements in the genetic testing space, an aging population and a corresponding rise in the number of chronic diseases, and increasing incidence of cancer cases are other factors propelling growth in the genetic testing market.
 
Primary revenue generating activity in this market revolves around DNA profiling aimed at better understanding the predisposition for diseases and possible adverse reactions that may occur with drugs that are currently available and/or under clinical development. Rising importance of early infection detection and prevention together with growing demand of DNA tests in pharmacogenomics or cancer genetic testing are significant factors responsible for the anticipated growth. In order to further capitalize on this opportunity, we have entered into an agreement to acquire the remaining outstanding equity interests of Genomas, Inc., a biomedical company that develops PhyzioType Systems for DNA-guided management and prescription of drugs used to treat mental illness, pain, heart disease and diabetes.
 
The Company owns and operates the following products and services to support its business objectives and to enable it to offer these services to its customers:
 
Medytox Diagnostics, Inc. (“MDI”)
 Through our CLIA certified laboratories, Rennova offers toxicology, clinical pharmacogenetics and esoteric testing. Rennova seeks to provide these testing services with superior logistics and specimen integrity, competitive turn-around times and excellent customer service.
Clinical Laboratory Operations
 The Company, through its wholly-owned MDI subsidiary, owns four clinical laboratories, as follows:
 

Laboratory | Location 
--------------------------------------+------------------
Alethea Laboratories, Inc. | Las Cruces, NM 
International Technologies, LLC | Waldwick, NJ 
EPIC Reference Labs, Inc. | Riviera Beach, FL
Epinex Diagnostics Laboratories, Inc. | Tustin, CA 

 
During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company experienced a substantial decline in the volume of samples processed at its laboratories and continued difficulty in receiving reimbursement for certain diagnostics. As result, in an effort to reduce costs, the Company is currently operating all of its Clinical Laboratory Operations business segment out of its EPIC Reference Labs, Inc. (“EPIC”) laboratory, and cost reduction efforts are continuing in response to the operating losses incurred in 2016. MDI formed EPIC as a wholly-owned subsidiary on January 29, 2013 to provide reference, confirmation and clinical testing services. The Company acquired necessary equipment and licenses in order to allow EPIC to test urine for drugs and medication monitoring. Operations at EPIC began in January 2014 using approximately 2,500 square feet and the premises has since been expanded to occupy approximately 12,500 square feet.
 
Epinex Diagnostics has initiated a relationship and integration with a California-based Clinical Research Organization that the Company believes will see it providing testing services to this Clinical Research Organization starting in the second quarter of 2017. Alethea Laboratories operates in a State that permits direct to consumer testing but remains subject to certain regulations governing the patient in the State from which they might order a diagnostic.
 
The Company’s Medytox Medical Marketing & Sales, Inc. (“MMMS”) subsidiary was formed on March 9, 2013 as a wholly-owned subsidiary to provide marketing, sales, and customer service exclusively for our clinical laboratories.
 
Supportive Software Solutions

Clinlab
 ClinLab is a Windows-based web-enabled laboratory information management system. It acts as a HIPAA-compliant data warehouse for lab results and includes reporting, data acquisition, label printing, electronic signoff and numerous interface capabilities to a multitude of reference labs and practice systems that scales from small physician-operated labs to large clinical reference laboratories.
 
Medical Mime
 Medical Mime’s suite of solutions includes a uniquely optimized EHR for substance abuse and behavioral health providers, a dictation-based ambulatory EHR for physician practices, and advanced transcription services. Solutions are web-based, 100% secure, and HIPAA compliant, with remote access, on-site training and intensive 24/7 technical support.
 
The Company has four operating subsidiaries that provide supportive services, historically primarily to its clinical laboratories and corporate operations and to a lesser but now increasing extent, third party customers.
 
Medical Billing Choices, Inc. (“MBC”): MBC was acquired by the Company on August 22, 2011 in an agreement that closed in July 2013. MBC provides revenue cycle management services to third party customers, with an initial focus on substance abuse facilities, by utilizing tools designed to improve documentation and collect information, driving faster reimbursement with fewer denied claims. MBC also functions as our in-house billing company which compiles and sends invoices to our Clinical Laboratory Operations customers (primarily insurance companies, Medicaid, Medicare, and Preferred Provider Organizations (“PPOs”)) for reimbursement.
Health Technology Solutions, Inc. (“HTS”): HTS is a wholly-owned subsidiary that provides information technology and software solutions including continued development of software to our subsidiaries and outside medical service providers. This entity provides the set up services for customers and supports our clinical labs and other operations.
 
ClinLab, Inc. (“ClinLab”): ClinLab was acquired by the Company on March 18, 2014. ClinLab develops and markets laboratory information management systems (“LIS”). ClinLab has installed its LIS into the Company’s laboratories to create a uniform LIS platform throughout the Company’s laboratories.
 
Medical Mime, Inc. (“Mime”): Mime was formed on May 9, 2014 as a wholly-owned subsidiary that specializes in EHR, initially targeting the rehab marketplace. We launched an enhanced version of our EHR software in the second quarter of 2016, which includes Electronic Medication Administration Records (“eMAR”). Our eMAR enhancement allows physicians to transition additional processes from paper to our software platform. eMAR automates the gathering, consolidating and presenting of data with more speed and accuracy than any manual system.
Decision Support Interpretation of Cancer and Genomic Diagnostics
 
We own a solution in CollabRx to provide evidence, interpretation and therapy guidance to enhance genomic testing and to provide actionable decision support for standardized, evidence-based cancer care and superior clinical outcomes in precision oncology. We also operate a biomedical company, Genomas, Inc. (“Genomas”), bringing DNA-Guided medicine to clinical practice with products for personalized prescription of drugs used in the treatment of mental illness, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease (“CVD”). Our products eliminate trial-and-error prescription with DNA-Guided medicine and enable physicians to treat with unprecedented precision, avoiding significant drug side effects, improving efficacy and enhancing patient compliance. Core applications are drug treatments of mood and thought disorders in mental illness and of cardiometabolic risk in diabetes and CVD.
 
CollabRx was acquired by the Company on November 2, 2015 via the Merger as discussed above. CollabRx develops and markets medical information and clinical decision support products and services intended to set a standard for the clinical interpretation of genomics-based, precision medicine.  CollabRx offers interpretation and decision support solutions that enhance cancer diagnoses and treatment through actionable data analytics and reporting for oncologists and their patients.

We entered into an agreement to acquire Genomas in late 2016. Genomas has developed PhyzioGenomics technology as a proprietary platform integrating genotypic and phenotypic measures to correlate gene variability with physiological variability. Genomas has established a DNA repository and clinical registry of 6,000 patients with mental illness, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The clinical data from these extensive cohorts is integrated systematically into the PhyzioClinica Database. A PhyzioType System consists of three components: an array of inherited, stable DNA polymorphisms from various genes to establish a patient’s combinatorial genotype, bioclinical algorithms for predicting the patient’s drug response, and a portal for doctors to select the best drug for the patient.
 
Hospital
 
The Company believes that the acquisition or development of hospitals will create a stable revenue base as a needed service and believes that it can expand the sales of its products and services to surrounding medical providers and doctors’ groups.
 
On January 13, 2017, we acquired the Hospital Assets, which include a 52,000 square foot hospital building and 6,300 square foot professional building on approximately 4.3 acres. Scott County Community Hospital, since renamed Big South Fork Medical Center, is classified as a Critical Access Hospital (rural) with 25 beds, a 24/7 emergency department, operating rooms and a laboratory that provides a range of diagnostic services. We expect to have the hospital open in part in the second quarter of 2017, and that the hospital will be fully operational by the third quarter of 2017, in each case, subject to the receipt of the necessary licenses and regulatory approvals.
 
The hospital had unaudited annual revenues of approximately $12 million, and a normalized EBITDA of approximately $1.3 million for Fiscal 2015, the last full year of the hospital's operation. These revenues were attributable to the typical services of a rural acute care hospital, including emergency room visits, outpatient procedures, diagnostic ancillary tests, physical therapy and inpatient hospital stays. Based on the hospital's historical information, we believe the hospital offers an established patient and stable revenue base as it serves the general healthcare needs of its community and supports local physicians.
 
Marketing Strategy
 
Rennova provides a suite of products and services to the medical services sector. We endeavor to be a single source for multiple business solutions that serve the medical services industry. We have invested in a professional sales team, a client services team and proprietary technologies to better serve the needs of the modern-day medical provider. The Company intends to expand, through its acquisition and subsequent integration of businesses, into a robust business model providing an extensive range of services to medical providers that demonstrate improved patient care and outcomes.
Competition
 
For our diagnostics division, the Company competes in a fragmented industry split between independently-owned and physician-owned laboratories. There are three predominant players in the industry that operate as full-service clinical laboratories (processing blood, urine and other tissue). In addition, the competition ranges from smaller privately-owned laboratories (3-6 employees) to large publicly-traded laboratories with significant market capitalizations.
 
For our software division the market for practice management, EHR and revenue cycle management (“RCM”) information solutions and related services is highly competitive, and we expect competition to increase in the future. We face competition from other providers of both integrated and stand-alone practice management, EHR and RCM solutions, including competitors who utilize a web-based platform and providers of locally installed software systems. Our competitors also include larger healthcare IT companies with longer operating histories, greater brand recognition and greater financial, marketing and other resources than us. We also compete with various regional RCM companies, some of which may continue to consolidate and expand into broader markets. We expect that competition will continue to increase as a result of consolidation in both the information technology and healthcare industries.
 
For our decision support and interpretation of cancer and genomic diagnostics sector, while we believe we have some distinguishing and unique features that create a competitive advantage, we also recognize that the sector has attracted many larger companies that have greater financial strength and marketing capabilities.
 
Governmental Regulation
 
General
 The clinical laboratory industry is subject to significant governmental laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels. As described below, these laws and regulations concern licensure and operation of clinical laboratories, claim submission and payment for laboratory services, health care fraud and abuse, security, privacy and confidentiality of health information, quality and environmental and occupational safety.

Regulation of Clinical Laboratories
 The Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (“CLIA”) are regulations that include federal standards applicable to all U.S. facilities or sites that test human specimens for health assessment or to diagnose, prevent, or treat disease. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”), in partnership with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) and the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), supports the CLIA program and clinical laboratory quality. CLIA requires that all clinical laboratories meet quality assurance, quality control and personnel standards. Laboratories also must undergo proficiency testing and are subject to inspections.
 
Standards for testing under CLIA are based on the complexity of the tests performed by the laboratory, with tests classified as “high complexity,” “moderate complexity,” or “waived.” Laboratories performing high complexity testing are required to meet more stringent requirements than moderate complexity laboratories. Laboratories performing only waived tests, which are tests determined by the FDA to have a low potential for error and requiring little oversight, may apply for a certificate of waiver exempting them from most of the requirements of CLIA. All Company facilities hold CLIA certificates to perform high complexity testing. The sanctions for failure to comply with CLIA requirements include suspension, revocation or limitation of a laboratory's CLIA certificate, which is necessary to conduct business, cancellation or suspension of the laboratory's approval to receive Medicare and/or Medicaid reimbursement, as well as significant fines and/or criminal penalties. The loss or suspension of a CLIA certification, imposition of a fine or other penalties, or future changes in the CLIA law or regulations (or interpretation of the law or regulations) could have a material adverse effect on the Company.
 
In addition to compliance with the federal regulations, the Company is also subject to state and local laboratory regulation. CLIA provides that a state may adopt laboratory regulations different from or more stringent than those contained in Federal law. There are approximately 12 states with state licensure or permit requirements for an independent lab facility physically located within the state. State laws may require that laboratory personnel meet certain qualifications, specify certain quality controls, or require maintenance of certain records. There are a number of states (including California and Florida) that have even more stringent requirements with which lab personnel must comply to obtain state licensure or a certificate of qualification.
 
The Company believes that it is in compliance with all applicable laboratory requirements. The Company's laboratories have continuing programs to ensure that their operations meet all such regulatory requirements, but no assurances can be given that the Company's laboratories will pass all future licensure or certification inspections. The Company has implemented the position of Chief Compliance Officer with supporting staff, including staff specifically for licensing, credentialing and certification inspection purposes. We embrace compliance as an integral part of our culture and we consistently promote that culture of ethics and integrity.
 
The FDA has regulatory responsibility over instruments, test kits, reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories. The FDA has issued draft guidance regarding FDA regulation of laboratory-developed tests (“LDTs”), but if or how the draft guidance will be implemented is uncertain. On November 18, 2016, the FDA announced it would not release final guidance at this time and instead would continue to work with stakeholders, the new administration and Congress to determine the right approach, and on January 3, 2017, the FDA released a discussion paper outlining a possible risk-based approach for FDA and CMS oversight of LTDs. There are many other regulatory and legislative proposals that would increase general FDA oversight of clinical laboratories and LDTs. The outcome and ultimate impact of such proposals on the business is difficult to predict at this time. Our point of collection testing devices are regulated by the FDA. The FDA has authority to take various administrative and legal actions for non-compliance, such as fines, product suspension, warning letters, injunctions and other civil and criminal sanctions. We make every good faith effort to exercise proactive monitoring and review of pending legislation and regulatory action.
 
Payment for Clinical Laboratory Services
 In each of 2016 and 2015, the Company derived less than 10% of its net sales directly from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. In addition, the Company's other business depends significantly on continued participation in these programs and in other government healthcare programs, in part because clients often want a single laboratory to perform all of their testing services. In recent years, both governmental and private sector payers have made efforts to contain or reduce health care costs, including reducing reimbursement for clinical laboratory services.

Reimbursement under the Medicare program for clinical diagnostic laboratory services is subject to a clinical laboratory fee schedule that sets the maximum amount payable in each Medicare carrier's jurisdiction. This clinical laboratory fee schedule is updated annually. Laboratories bill the program directly for covered tests performed on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries. State Medicaid programs are prohibited from paying more than the Medicare fee schedule limit for clinical laboratory services furnished to Medicaid recipients.
 
Payment under the Medicare fee schedule has been limited from year to year by Congressional action, including imposition of national limitation amounts and freezes on the otherwise applicable annual Consumer Price Index (“CPI”) updates. For most diagnostic lab tests, the national limitation is now 74.0% of the national median of all local fee schedules established for each test. Under a provision of the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 (“BIPA”), for tests performed after January 1, 2001 that the Secretary of Health and Human Services determines are new tests for which no limitation amount has previously been established, the cap is set at 100% of the median.
 
Medicare, Medicaid and other government program payment reductions will not currently have a direct adverse effect on the Company's net earnings and cash flows, due to insignificant revenue earned, however, it is not currently possible to project what impact will be had in future years.
 
In addition to reimbursement rates, the Company is also impacted by changes in coverage policies for laboratory tests. Congressional action in 1997 required the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) to adopt uniform coverage, administration and payment policies for many of the most commonly performed lab tests using a negotiated rulemaking process. The negotiated rulemaking committee established uniform policies limiting Medicare coverage for certain tests to patients with specified medical conditions or diagnoses, replacing local Medicare coverage policies which varied around the country. The final rules generally became effective in 2002, and the use of uniform policies improves the Company's ability to obtain necessary billing information in some cases, but Medicare, Medicaid and private payer diagnosis code requirements and payment policies continue to negatively impact the Company's ability to be paid for some of the tests it performs. Due to the range of payers and policies, the extent of this impact continues to be difficult to quantify.
 
Future changes in federal, state and local laws and regulations (or in the interpretation of current regulations) affecting government payment for clinical laboratory testing could have a material adverse effect on the Company. In March 2010, comprehensive healthcare legislation, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“ACA”), was enacted. Numerous proposals continue to be discussed in Congress and the administration to repeal, amend or replace the ACA. Based on currently available information, the Company is unable to predict what type of changes in legislation or regulations, if any, will occur.
 
Standard Electronic Transactions, Security and Confidentiality of Health Information and Other Personal Information
 The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) was designed to address issues related to the security and confidentiality of health insurance information. In an effort to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the health care system by facilitating the electronic exchange of information in certain financial and administrative transactions, HIPAA regulations were promulgated. These regulations apply to health plans, health care providers that conduct standard transactions electronically and health care clearinghouses (“covered entities”). Five such regulations have been finalized: (i) the Transactions and Code Sets Rule; (ii) the Privacy Rule; (iii) the Security Rule; (iv) the Standard Unique Employer Identifier Rule, which requires the use of a unique employer identifier in connection with certain electronic transactions; and (v) the National Provider Identifier Rule, which requires the use of a unique health care provider identifier in connection with certain electronic transactions.
 
The Privacy Rule regulates the use and disclosure of protected health information (“PHI”) by covered entities. It also sets forth certain rights that an individual has with respect to his or her PHI maintained by a covered entity, such as the right to access or amend certain records containing PHI or to request restrictions on the use or disclosure of PHI. The Privacy Rule requires covered entities to contractually bind third parties, known as business associates, in the event that they perform an activity or service for or on behalf of the covered entity that involves access to PHI. The Security Rule establishes requirements for safeguarding patient information that is electronically transmitted or electronically stored. The Company believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with the requirements of the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules.

The Federal Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), which was enacted in February 2009, with regulations effective on September 23, 2013, strengthens and expands the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules and their restrictions on use and disclosure of PHI. HITECH includes, but is not limited to, prohibitions on exchanging PHI for remuneration, and additional restrictions on the use of PHI for marketing. HITECH also fundamentally changes a business associate's obligations by imposing a number of Privacy Rule requirements and a majority of Security Rule provisions directly on business associates that were previously only directly applicable to covered entities. Moreover, HITECH requires covered entities to provide notice to individuals, HHS, and, as applicable, the media when PHI is breached, as that term is defined by HITECH. Business associates are similarly required to notify covered entities of a breach. The Company believes its policies and procedures are fully compliant with the HITECH requirements.
 
On February 6, 2014, the CMS and HHS published final regulations that amended the HIPAA Privacy Rule to provide individuals (or their personal representatives) with the right to receive copies of their test reports from laboratories subject to HIPAA, or to request that copies of their test reports be transmitted to designated third parties. Previously, laboratories that were CLIA-certified or CLIA-exempt were not subject to the provision in the Privacy Rule that provides individuals with the right of access to PHI. The HIPAA Privacy Rule amendment resulted in the preemption of a number of state laws that prohibit a laboratory from releasing a test report directly to the individual. The Company revised its policies and procedures to comply with these new access requirements and has updated its privacy notice to reflect individuals' new access rights under this final rule.
 
The standard unique employer identifier regulations require that employers have standard national numbers that identify them on standard transactions. The Employer Identification Number, also known as a Federal Tax Identification Number, issued by the Internal Revenue Service, was selected as the identifier for employers and was adopted effective July 30, 2002. The Company believes it is in compliance with these requirements.
 
The administrative simplification provisions of HIPAA mandate the adoption of standard unique identifiers for health care providers. The intent of these provisions is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the electronic transmission of health information. The National Provider Identification Rule requires that all HIPAA-covered health care providers, whether they are individuals or organizations, must obtain a National Provider Identifier (“NPI”) to identify themselves in standard HIPAA transactions. NPI replaces the unique provider identification number - as well as other provider numbers previously assigned by payers and other entities - for the purpose of identifying providers in standard electronic transactions. The Company believes that it is in compliance with the HIPAA National Provider Identification Rule in all material respects.
 
The total cost associated with the requirements of HIPAA and HITECH is not expected to be material to the Company's operations or cash flows. However, future regulations and interpretations of HIPAA and HITECH could impose significant costs on the Company.
 
In addition to the HIPAA regulations described above, there are a number of other Federal and state laws regarding the confidentiality and security of medical information, some of which apply to clinical laboratories. These laws vary widely, but they most commonly regulate or restrict the collection, use and disclosure of medical and financial information and other personal information. In some cases, state laws are more restrictive than and therefore not preempted by HIPAA. Penalties for violation of these laws may include sanctions against a laboratory's licensure, as well as civil and/or criminal penalties. Violations of the HIPAA provisions could result in civil and/or criminal penalties, including significant fines and up to 10 years in prison. HITECH also significantly strengthened HIPAA enforcement. It increased the civil penalty amounts that may be imposed, required HHS to conduct periodic audits to confirm compliance and also authorized state attorneys general to bring civil actions seeking either injunctions or damages in response to violations of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations that affect the privacy of state residents. Additionally, numerous other countries have or are developing similar laws governing the collection, use, disclosure and transmission of personal and/or patient information.
 
The Company believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with the current Transactions and Code Sets Rule. The Company implemented Version 5010 of the HIPAA Transaction Standards and believes it has fully adopted the ICD-10-CM code set. The compliance date for ICD-10-CM was October 1, 2015. The costs associated with ICD-10-CM Code Set were substantial, and failure of the Company, third party payers or physicians to apply the new code set could have an adverse impact on reimbursement, day’s sales outstanding and cash collections. As a result of inconsistent application of transaction standards by payers or the Company's inability to obtain certain billing information not usually provided to the Company by physicians, the Company could face increased costs and complexity, a temporary disruption in receipts and ongoing reductions in reimbursements and net revenues.

The Company believes it is in compliance in all material respects with the Operating Rules for electronic funds transfers and remittance advice transactions, for which the compliance date was January 1, 2014.
 
Fraud and Abuse Laws and Regulations
 Existing federal laws governing federal health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, as well as similar state laws, impose a variety of broadly described fraud and abuse prohibitions on health care providers, including clinical laboratories. These laws are interpreted liberally and enforced aggressively by multiple government agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice, HHS' Office of Inspector General (“OIG”), and various state agencies. Historically, the clinical laboratory industry has been the focus of major governmental enforcement initiatives. The federal government's enforcement efforts have been increasing over the past decade, in part as a result of the enactment of HIPAA, which included several provisions related to fraud and abuse enforcement, including the establishment of a program to coordinate and fund federal, state and local law enforcement efforts. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 also included new requirements directed at Medicaid fraud, including increased spending on enforcement and financial incentives for states to adopt false claims act provisions similar to the federal False Claims Act. Recent amendments to the False Claims Act, as well as other enhancements to the federal fraud and abuse laws enacted as part of the ACA, are widely expected to further increase fraud and abuse enforcement efforts. For example, the ACA established an obligation to report and refund overpayments from Medicare within 60 days of identification (whether or not paid through any fault of the recipient); failure to comply with this new requirement can give rise to additional liability under the False Claims Act and Civil Monetary Penalties statute. On February 11, 2016, CMS issued the final rule clarifying certain aspects of the overpayment requirement for purposes of Medicare, effective on March 14, 2016.
 
The federal health care programs’ anti-kickback law (the “Anti-Kickback Law”) prohibits knowingly providing anything of value in return for, or to induce the referral of, Medicare, Medicaid or other federal health care program business. Violations can result in imprisonment, fines, penalties, and/or exclusion from participation in federal health care programs. The OIG has published “safe harbor” regulations which specify certain arrangements that are protected from prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Law if all conditions of the relevant safe harbor are met. Failure to fit within a safe harbor does not necessarily constitute a violation of the Anti-Kickback Law; rather, the arrangement would be subject to scrutiny by regulators and prosecutors and would be evaluated on a case by case basis. Many states have their own Medicaid anti-kickback laws and several states also have anti-kickback laws that apply to all payers (i.e., not just government health care programs).
 
From time to time, the OIG issues alerts and other guidance on certain practices in the health care industry that implicate the Anti-Kickback Law or other federal fraud and abuse laws. Examples of such guidance documents particularly relevant to the Company and its operations follow.
 
In October 1994, the OIG issued a Special Fraud Alert on arrangements for the provision of clinical laboratory services. The Fraud Alert set forth a number of practices allegedly engaged in by some clinical laboratories and health care providers that raise issues under the federal fraud and abuse laws, including the Anti-Kickback Law. These practices include: (i) providing employees to furnish valuable services for physicians (other than collecting patient specimens for testing) that are typically the responsibility of the physicians' staff; (ii) offering certain laboratory services at prices below fair market value in return for referrals of other tests which are billed to Medicare at higher rates; (iii) providing free testing to physicians' managed care patients in situations where the referring physicians benefit from such reduced laboratory utilization; (iv) providing free pick-up and disposal of bio-hazardous waste for physicians for items unrelated to a laboratory's testing services; (v) providing general-use facsimile machines or computers to physicians that are not exclusively used in connection with the laboratory services; and (vi) providing free testing for health care providers, their families and their employees (i.e., so-called “professional courtesy” testing). The OIG emphasized in the Special Fraud Alert that when one purpose of such arrangements is to induce referrals of program-reimbursed laboratory testing, both the clinical laboratory and the health care provider (e.g., physician) may be liable under the Anti-Kickback Law, and may be subject to criminal prosecution and exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. More recently, in June 2014, the OIG issued another Special Fraud Alert addressing compensation paid by laboratories to referring physicians for blood specimen processing and for submitting patient data to registries. This Special Fraud Alert reiterates the OIG’s longstanding concerns about payments from laboratories to physicians in excess of the fair market value of the physician’s services and payments that reflect the volume or value of referrals of federal healthcare program business.

Another issue the OIG has expressed concern about involves the provision of discounts on laboratory services billed to customers in return for the referral of federal health care program business. In a 1999 Advisory Opinion, the OIG concluded that a proposed arrangement whereby a laboratory would offer physicians significant discounts on non-federal health care program laboratory tests might violate the Anti-Kickback Law. The OIG reasoned that the laboratory could be viewed as providing such discounts to the physician in exchange for referrals by the physician of business to be billed by the laboratory to Medicare at non-discounted rates. The OIG indicated that the arrangement would not qualify for protection under the discount safe harbor to the Anti-Kickback Law because Medicare and Medicaid would not get the benefit of the discount. Similarly, in a 1999 correspondence, the OIG stated that if any direct or indirect link exists between a discounts that a laboratory offers to a skilled nursing facility (“SNF”) for tests covered under Medicare's payments to the SNF and the referral of tests billable by the laboratory under Medicare Part B, then the Anti-Kickback Law would be implicated.
 
The OIG also has issued guidance regarding joint venture arrangements that may be viewed as suspect under the Anti-Kickback Law. These documents have relevance to clinical laboratories that are part of (or are considering establishing) joint ventures with potential sources of federal health care program business. The first guidance document, which focused on investor referrals to such ventures, was issued in 1989 and another concerning contractual joint ventures was issued in April 2003. Some of the elements of joint ventures that the OIG identified as “suspect” include: arrangements in which the capital invested by the physicians is disproportionately small and the return on investment is disproportionately large when compared to a typical investment; specific selection of investors who are in a position to make referrals to the venture; and arrangements in which one of the parties to the joint venture expands into a line of business that is dependent on referrals from the other party (sometimes called “shell” joint ventures). In a 2004 advisory opinion, the OIG expressed concern about a proposed joint venture in which a laboratory company would assist physician groups in establishing off-site pathology laboratories. The OIG indicated that the physicians' financial and business risk in the venture was minimal and that the physicians would contract out substantially all laboratory operations, committing very little in the way of financial, capital, or human resources. The OIG was unable to exclude the possibility that the arrangement was designed to permit the laboratory to pay the physician groups for their referrals, and therefore was unwilling to find that the arrangement fell within a safe harbor or had sufficient safeguards to protect against fraud or abuse.
 
Violations of other fraud and abuse laws also can result in exclusion from participation in federal health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. One basis for such exclusion is an individual's or entity's submission of claims to Medicare or Medicaid that are substantially in excess of that individual's or entity’s usual charges for like items or services. In 2003, the OIG issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would have defined the terms “usual charges” and “substantially in excess” in ways that might have required providers, including the Company, to either lower their charges to Medicare and Medicaid or increase charges to certain other payers to avoid the risk of exclusion. On June 18, 2007, however, the OIG withdrew the proposed rule, saying it preferred to continue evaluating billing patterns on a case-by-case basis. In its withdrawal notice, the OIG also said it “remains concerned about disparities in the amounts charged to Medicare and Medicaid when compared to private payers,” that it continues to believe its exclusion authority for excess charges “provides useful backstop protection for the public fisc from providers that routinely charge Medicare or Medicaid substantially more than their other customers,” and that it will continue to use “all tools available … to address instances where Medicare or Medicaid are charged substantially more than other payers.” An enforcement action by the OIG under this statutory exclusion basis or an enforcement by Medicaid officials of similar state law restrictions could have a material adverse effect on the Company.
 
Under another federal statute, known as the “Stark Law” or “self-referral” prohibition, physicians who have a financial or compensation relationship with a clinical laboratory may not, unless an exception applies, refer Medicare patients for testing to the laboratory, regardless of the intent of the parties. Similarly, laboratories may not bill Medicare for services furnished pursuant to a prohibited self-referral. There are several Stark Law exceptions that are relevant to arrangements involving clinical laboratories, including: 1) fair market value compensation for the provision of items or services; 2) payments by physicians to a laboratory for clinical laboratory services; 3) an exception for certain ancillary services (including laboratory services) provided within the referring physician's own office, if certain criteria are satisfied; 4) physician investment in a company whose stock is traded on a public exchange and has stockholder equity exceeding $75.0 million; and 5) certain space and equipment rental arrangements that are set at a fair market value rate and satisfy other requirements. All of the requirements of a Stark Law exception must be met to take advantage of the exception. Many states have their own self-referral laws as well, which in some cases apply to all patient referrals, not just government reimbursement programs.

There are a variety of other types of federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including laws prohibiting submission of false or fraudulent claims. The Company seeks to conduct its business in compliance with all federal and state fraud and abuse laws. The Company is unable to predict how these laws will be applied in the future, and no assurances can be given that its arrangements will not be subject to scrutiny under such laws. Sanctions for violations of these laws may include exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health care programs, significant criminal and civil fines and penalties, and loss of licensure. Any exclusion from participation in a federal or state health care program, or any loss of licensure, arising from any action by any federal or state regulatory or enforcement authority, would likely have a material adverse effect on the Company's business. In addition, any significant criminal or civil penalty resulting from such proceedings could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business.
 
Environmental, Health and Safety
 The Company is subject to licensing and regulation under federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety laws and regulations relating to the handling, transportation and disposal of medical specimens, infectious and hazardous waste and radioactive materials. All Company laboratories are subject to applicable federal and state laws and regulations relating to biohazard disposal of all laboratory specimens and the Company generally utilizes outside vendors for disposal of such specimens. In addition, the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for health care employers, including clinical laboratories, whose workers may be exposed to blood-borne pathogens such as HIV and the hepatitis B virus. These regulations, among other things, require work practice controls, protective clothing and equipment, training, medical follow-up, vaccinations and other measures designed to minimize exposure to, and transmission of, blood-borne pathogens.
 
On November 6, 2000, Congress passed the Needle Stick Safety and Prevention Act, which required, among other things, that companies include in their safety programs the evaluation and use of engineering controls such as safety needles if found to be effective at reducing the risk of needle stick injuries in the workplace. The Company has implemented the use of safety needles at all of its service locations, where applicable.
 
Although the Company is not aware of any current material non-compliance with such federal, state and local laws and regulations, failure to comply could subject the Company to denial of the right to conduct business, fines, criminal penalties and/or other enforcement actions.
 
Drug Testing
 There is no comprehensive federal law that regulates drug testing in the private sector. The Drug-Free Workplace Act does impose certain employee education requirements on companies that do business with the government, but it does not require testing, nor does it restrict testing in any way. Drug testing is allowed under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) because the ADA does not consider drug abuse a disability -- but the law does not regulate or prohibit testing. Instead of a comprehensive regulatory system, federal law provides for specific agencies to adopt drug testing regulations for employers under their jurisdiction. As a general rule, testing is presumed to be lawful unless there is a specific restriction in state or federal law.
Controlled Substances
 The use of controlled substances in testing for drugs of abuse is regulated by the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration.
 
Compliance Program
 The Company continuously evaluates and monitors its compliance with all Medicare, Medicaid and other rules and regulations. The objective of the Company's compliance program is to develop, implement, and update compliance safeguards as necessary. Emphasis is placed on developing and implementing compliance policies and guidelines, personnel training programs and various monitoring and audit procedures to attempt to achieve implementation of all applicable rules and regulations.
 
The Company seeks to conduct its business in compliance with all statutes, regulations, and other requirements applicable to its clinical laboratory operations. The clinical laboratory testing industry is, however, subject to extensive regulation, and many of these statutes and regulations have not been interpreted by the courts. There can be no assurance that applicable statutes and regulations will not be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that would adversely affect the Company. Potential sanctions for violation of these statutes and regulations include significant fines and the loss of various licenses, certificates, and authorizations, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business.
