ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview 
 
Black Diamond, Inc. (which may be referred to as the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us”), through its ownership of Black Diamond Equipment, Ltd., is a global leader in designing, manufacturing, and marketing innovative outdoor engineered equipment and apparel for climbing, mountaineering, backpacking, skiing, and a wide range of other year-round outdoor recreation activities. Black Diamond Equipment and PIEPS™, are synonymous with performance, innovation, durability and safety in the outdoor consumer community. We are targeted not only to the demanding requirements of core climbers, skiers and alpinists, but also to the more general outdoor performance enthusiasts and consumers interested in outdoor-inspired gear for their backcountry and urban activities. Our Black Diamond® and PIEPS™ brands are iconic in the active outdoor and ski industries, and linked intrinsically with the modern history of these sports. Headquartered in Salt Lake City at the base of the Wasatch Mountains, our products are designed and exhaustively tested by an engaged team of discerning entrepreneurs and engineers.
 
We offer a broad range of products including: high performance apparel (such as jackets, shells, pants and bibs); rock-climbing equipment (such as carabiners, protection devices, harnesses, belay devices, helmets, and ice-climbing gear); technical backpacks and high-end day packs; tents; trekking poles; headlamps and lanterns; and gloves and mittens. We also offer advanced skis, ski poles, ski skins, and snow safety products, including avalanche airbag systems, avalanche transceivers, shovels, and probes.  We distribute our products through a network comprised primarily of leading independent specialty retailers, specialty chains such as Recreational Equipment, Inc. (“REI”), independent global distributors selling to specialty retail, and direct-to-consumer through our website and wholly-owned retail store. Our products are sold in North America, Europe, Asia, and the rest of the world in over 50 countries, with international sales representing approximately 49% of our sales for the year ended December 31, 2016. Canada is our single largest international country in which we conduct business, representing 8% of our total sales for the year ended December 31, 2016.
 
Our heritage dates back to 1957 when Chouinard Equipment Ltd. pioneered the market for durable, precise, and reusable pitons — devices used to ascend or protect oneself in the event of a fall in the sport of big wall rock climbing. Over the next thirty years, Chouinard Equipment expanded to design and manufacture all kinds of equipment for rock climbing and mountain, canyon, and crag activities. In 1989 Black Diamond Equipment was founded when our predecessor company acquired the business and assets of Chouinard Equipment. In our 60 year heritage, we have developed a track record of gear innovations that has changed the nature of climbing, mountaineering, and skiing. By extension, our history and brands have become synonymous with the sports in which we participate. The genesis of the current Black Diamond, Inc. was through the May 2010 acquisition of Black Diamond Equipment, Ltd. (which may be referred to as “Black Diamond Equipment” or “BDEL”) and Gregory Mountain Products, Inc. (which may be referred to as “Gregory Mountain Products”, “Gregory” or “GMP”) by Clarus Corporation, a public company. Clarus Corporation, incorporated in Delaware in 1991, was renamed Black Diamond, Inc. in January 2011. In July 2012, we acquired POC Sweden AB and its subsidiaries (collectively, “POC”) and in October 2012, we acquired PIEPS Holding GmbH and its subsidiaries (collectively, “PIEPS”).
 
On July 23, 2014, the Company and Gregory Mountain Products, its wholly-owned subsidiary, completed the sale of certain assets to Samsonite LLC (“Samsonite”) comprising Gregory’s business of designing, manufacturing, marketing, distributing and selling technical, alpine, backpacking, hiking, mountaineering and active trail products and accessories as well as outdoor-inspired lifestyle bags (the “Gregory Business”) pursuant to the terms of that certain Asset Purchase Agreement (the “GMP Purchase Agreement”), dated as of June 18, 2014, by and among the Company, Gregory and Samsonite. Under the terms of the GMP Purchase Agreement, Samsonite paid $84,135,000 in cash for Gregory’s assets comprising the Gregory Business and assumed certain specified liabilities (the “GMP Sale”). The activities of Gregory have been segregated and reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
 
On March 16, 2015, the Company announced that it was exploring a full range of strategic alternatives, including a sale of the entire Company and the potential sales of the Company’s Black Diamond Equipment (including PIEPS) and POC brands in two separate transactions.
 
On October 7, 2015, the Company and the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Ember Scandinavia AB (“Ember”), sold their respective equity interests in POC comprising POC’s business of designing, manufacturing, marketing, distributing and selling advanced-design helmets, body armor, goggles, eyewear, gloves, and apparel for action or “gravity sports,” such as skiing, snowboarding, and cycling pursuant to a Purchase Agreement (the “POC Purchase Agreement”), dated as of October 7, 2015, by and among the Company and Ember, as sellers, and Dainese S.p.A. and Dainese U.S.A., Inc. (collectively “Dainese”), as purchasers. Under the terms of the POC Purchase Agreement, Dainese paid $63,639,000 in cash for POC (the “POC Disposition”). The activities of POC have been segregated and reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented.

On October 8, 2015, the Company announced the completion of the POC Disposition resulting in the conclusion of the Company’s review of strategic alternatives.
 
On November 9, 2015, the Company announced that it is seeking to redeploy our significant cash balances to invest in high quality, durable, cash flow-producing assets potentially unrelated to the outdoor industry in order to diversify our business and potentially monetize our substantial net operating losses as part of our asset redeployment and diversification strategy. We intend to focus our search primarily in the United States, although we will also evaluate international investment opportunities should we find such opportunities attractive.
 
Market Overview
 
Our business and brands are focused on the convergence of function and fashion in the outdoor and athletic apparel, footwear, and equipment space. We believe consumer purchase decisions are driven by both a need for functional products with distinctive aesthetics and a desire to create a particular lifestyle perception. This confluence and consumer behavior can be seen in a number of highly successful lifestyle brands including Lululemon, Under Armour, The North Face, Patagonia and Nike. Primary growth drivers in our business include innovative products that provide a higher level of protection, performance and/or comfort, an increased awareness in health and wellness, the desire to own functional products that are aesthetically pleasing, and the continued success and exposure of our key retail partners, including REI, Mountain Equipment Co-op, Backcountry.com, Au Vieux Campeur, Globetrotter, Sport Shuster, and Bachli Bergsport. The outdoor products marketplace, both domestically and internationally, is highly fragmented. Specialty brands, particularly throughout Europe, hold respectable market share relative to larger competitors. We see this fragmentation as an opportunity for a leader to emerge, particularly in the more technical categories. We believe that our strong relationships in the specialty retail channel and our expanding online presence provide us with a competitive advantage and the opportunity for continued growth.
Competitive Strengths
 
We live and breathe the adventure sports that we represent and approach business like we approach our sporting passions, where there is precious little room for error. We believe the following strengths differentiate us from our competitors, allowing us to take advantage of the large and growing market in which we participate:
 
Authentic Portfolio of Iconic/Lifestyle Brands. We believe that our brands are iconic among devoted active outdoor adventurers and skiers with a strong reputation for innovation, style, quality, design, safety and durability. Our brands also appeal to everyday customers seeking high quality, outdoor-inspired lifestyle products for outdoor or urban and suburban living. The authenticity of our brands is reinforced by our selective distribution strategy focused on specialty retail stores that we believe are the most influential stores within the outdoor recreation and active lifestyle communities. We believe our brands transcend age, culture and geography, and our paradigm-changing products define their respective product categories. Our focus on innovation, safety and style differentiates us from our competitors and positions Black Diamond Equipment to address the growing market for outdoor recreation equipment and active lifestyle products.
 
Global Brands

Product Innovation and Development Capabilities. We have a long history of technical innovation and product development, with over 100 patents and patents pending worldwide and hundreds of new product introductions since 1989. Our employees’ passion and intimacy with our core outdoor activities fosters new and innovative ideas, which we believe provides a significant advantage that will drive our company and industry to new levels. Our Salt Lake City headquarters, nestled in the Wasatch Mountains, with a vibrant user community, provides the ideal backdrop for our employees, many of whom are high-level performance athletes in these sports themselves, to test and refine our new products. We endorse several top athletes who evaluate our products in the field, providing valuable feedback and suggestions to our designers. In recent years, we have developed many innovative products that have revolutionized the active outdoor space including: Revolt, our highly versatile rechargeable headlamp, featuring a waterproof design, PowerTap Technology and massive 300 lumens with the added option of charging via USB or using standard alkaline batteries; First Light Hoody, constructed with lightweight Schoeller® and packed with PrimaLoft® Silver Insulation Active; Helio Fixed Length Carbon ski pole, built with 100% inflation-molded carbon fiber for the ultimate combination of strength and lightweight performance; Camalot Ultralights, incorporating sculpted lobes and a patent-pending continuously looped Dyneema® core to replace the cable stem making them among the lightest camming units on the market; JetForce®, the first avalanche airbag that uses electronically controlled jet-fan inflation technology; trekking poles with FlickLock® technology; Z-Poles™, trekking poles that can fold to one-third their size; the Magnetron® magnetically locking carabiner; the Vapor climbing helmet, one of the lightest climbing helmets on the market; and PIEPS Micro beacon, having a patented sensor technology. We seek to design products that enhance our customers’ personal performance, safety, and comfort as they participate in the activities we serve. We integrate quality assurance and quality control teams throughout the entire design process to maintain the quality, integrity, and safety that our brands are known for. We believe that our vertically integrated design, development process and enthusiastic employee base provide us with a unique competitive advantage to continue to drive future innovation for our Company and the markets we serve.
 
Diversified Portfolio by Product, Geography and Channel. Our business is highly diversified across products, geographies, and channels. We operate a multi-brand business with Black Diamond® and PIEPS™ branded products spanning 29 single product categories addressing three primary categories of climbing, mountaineering, and skiing. Our lighting product category is the only product category which accounts for more than 15% of annual sales. This provides seasonal diversification with a balance of sales across both the fall/winter and spring/summer sports seasons. Our brands are truly global with approximately 49% of our sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 generated outside the United States in over 50 countries. We have a diversified customer base and sell products in approximately 5,000 retail locations, including independent and specialty stores, our wholly-owned retail store, our website at www.blackdiamondequipment.com, and other retail locations. We believe that our product, geographic, and distribution channel diversity allows us to maximize the reach of our brand portfolio while reducing the risk associated with any single product category or point of distribution.
 
Scalable Global Operating Platform. We have developed a highly scalable global platform of manufacturing, sourcing, quality assurance, distribution, IT, and back office capabilities. We manufacture approximately 20% to 25% of our proprietary products in-house, which we believe helps us maintain our competitive advantage over our peers. We also have a global network of high-quality strategic partners, many of whom we have had relationships with for over ten years, from which we source the remaining approximately 75% to 80% of our products. We have an in-house quality assurance team in Salt Lake City, allowing for real-time testing and development. Our back-office functions, including supply chain management, warehousing, sourcing, and finance, run on our global ERP platform.
Core Values Deeply Rooted in Organization. Our company was founded with the vision of being one with the sports we serve, absolutely indistinguishable from them. Our mission is to profitably design, manufacture, and bring to market innovative and technical products of high quality, high performance, and exemplary durability that are targeted toward our primary customers – climbers, mountaineers, off-piste skiers, and outdoor enthusiasts. We define ourselves on a five-pillar founding construct: passion and intimacy, innovation, efficiency, value and service, and style. Our employees have a tight bond and shared enthusiasm for the active outdoors. We take pride in our efforts to support conservation, education, and recreation groups that are on the frontlines of protecting and preserving the wild lands we love and depend on. These shared core values enable us to attract and retain like-minded, highly motivated employees with passion for the active outdoors.
Experienced and Incentivized Senior Management Team. Our senior management team has been involved in the operation, acquisition, and integration of several successful companies. We are also supported by the skills and collective experience of Warren B. Kanders, our Executive Chairman, and Robert R. Schiller, our Executive Vice Chairman, who have substantial experience working together in managing operations and building public companies through strategic acquisitions and organic development, notably at Armor Holdings, Inc. Mr. Kanders and Mr. Schiller have worked together for the past 20 years. We have assembled a proven and talented global management team. Our executives share a passion for outdoor recreation and an active lifestyle, and possess substantial experience in product development, marketing, and merchandising. The members of our Board of Directors and our executive officers, including Messrs. Kanders and Schiller, are substantial stockholders of the Company and beneficially own approximately 34% of our outstanding common stock as of March 1, 2017, which we believe aligns the interests of our Board of Directors and our executive officers with those of our stockholders.

Growth Strategy
 
We intend to achieve sustainable, profitable growth by expanding organically in each of our historical product lines.
 
Continue to service and grow existing retail accounts. Since our inception, we have developed strong relationships with our key retail partners through a mutual respect and admiration for the sports we serve. As the outdoor retail industry expands in terms of both sales and store count, we believe that we are well-poised to capitalize on this growth opportunity. Through our various corporate initiatives, a focus on being easy to do business with, the extension of our existing product portfolios, and an emphasis on brand awareness and in-store marketing, we plan to grow our existing retail accounts as well as foster new relationships.
 
Introduce New Product Technologies and Expand Existing Brands Into New Categories. We believe our investment in research and development and new product extensions present opportunities, through both technological innovation and expansion into new categories. We have a long history of technical innovation, introducing hundreds of new products and growing sales at a 12% compound annual growth rate since 1989. We expect our continued product innovation will drive future growth.
 
We continue to seek to expand our business into both adjacent and complementary product categories, including outdoor technical apparel and footwear. We have expanded our product offerings and grown our sales through innovation in gloves, trekking poles, helmets, headlamps and apparel as well as introducing new technologies, such as our JetForce avalanche airbags. We believe apparel represents a logical progression for our outdoor brands while also believing that footwear is another natural extension of our product offerings.
 
Broaden Distribution Footprint. We believe there is a significant opportunity to expand our brand presence and penetration outside of the U.S. market. The European alpine market is currently significantly larger than the U.S. market and is highly fragmented by country, with no clear leader across Europe. We have been able to gain market share by emphasizing our Black Diamond® brand, positioning it as a global brand with American roots and PIEPS™ as a global brand with European roots. Furthermore, we plan to seek to increase the number of doors we sell through and drive higher sales through new and existing doors.
 
We believe that our presence in Asia, driven by our business in Hong Kong, China, South Korea, Japan and other key Asian markets, represents a significant growth opportunity.
 
Develop Brand Profile. We believe there is an opportunity to further enhance our brand image through enhanced marketing efforts. Our brands have a strong and iconic reputation among outdoor enthusiasts, and we expect that reinforcing our brand message with targeted marketing efforts will further develop our brand position. Our social media reach is large, and online engagement is growing. Continued focus on these channels is also expected to enhance our brand equity.
Expand Our Operating Margins. We believe opportunities exist to increase our margins to be more in-line with our outdoor peers. A primary driver of our expected margin expansion will include leveraging investments made into our global operating platform as our sales grow, and cost and operational improvements in our sourcing and supply chain. Additionally, we expect to see margin expansion as we shift our sales mix to higher margin products and build our direct-to-consumer business with their higher margins.
Our Brands
 
Our Black Diamond® and PIEPS™ brands represent the pinnacle of innovation, quality, and performance to our customers in the active outdoor industry. Both have rich histories that we believe transcend age, ethnicity, and geography, and both have reputations as pioneers in the industry, designing and manufacturing gear that has changed the history of their collective sports.
Black Diamond®
 
Founded in 1989, Black Diamond Equipment is devoted to fostering the enthusiasm and dreams necessary to design and manufacture what we believe to be the best climbing and skiing gear in the world. Black Diamond Equipment’s roots date back to 1957, when Chouinard Equipment Ltd. first manufactured rock climbing equipment. From its inspired beginning in 1957, Black Diamond Equipment has grown into a global company with operations in the United States and Europe. Since then, Black Diamond Equipment’s innovative gear designs have set the standards in numerous areas, including rock climbing, mountaineering, backcountry skiing, ice climbing, and trekking. This is the result of dedication, desire, and passion on the part of Black Diamond Equipment’s team of people who are climbers, skiers and mountaineers.

Black Diamond Equipment’s brand philosophy is based on building equipment to be ‘one with the sports we serve’. Innovation in equipment design pares with progression in human achievement. Award winning and acclaimed carbon fiber ice tools, super-light wire gate carabiners, avalanche safety products and best-in-class trekking poles and headlamps allow climbers and skiers to go further and encounter more difficult terrain; focusing on the experience, not the gear that facilitates adventure.
 
Today, our commitment to the founding principles of Black Diamond Equipment remains as strong as ever. With 60 years of heritage and 27 years in business, Black Diamond Equipment continues to strive to serve the spirit for all the sports we serve, and the sports’ values and goals, past, present, and future.
 
Black Diamond Equipment’s intimacy with skiing, climbing, and mountaineering is validated by winning four awards at the Winter Outdoor Retailer Winter Market 2017 in Salt Lake City, Utah, in the backcountry skiing and equipment categories. In 2016, Black Diamond was honored by over 20 media channels and independent reviewers garnering nearly 40 awards in 2016 for equipment and apparel in climbing, mountaineering, and skiing.
 
PIEPS™
 
Founded in 2006, with roots dating back to 1972, PIEPS is recognized as an innovator and technology leader in avalanche safety equipment. PIEPS offers a focused range of premium avalanche safety products, including transceivers and probes, shovels, safety equipment, and packs. PIEPS is the official safety partner of the Association of Austrian Mountain and Ski Guides. PIEPS played a key partnership role with Black Diamond Equipment in the development of the new JetForce avalanche airbag technology platform.
Our Products
 
Black Diamond Equipment has grown in revenue and stature by designing, manufacturing, and distributing products that naturally anticipate the needs of our consumers. As end users, Black Diamond Equipment employees use, design, engineer, build and repeat the process ceaselessly, incrementally improving upon innovation year over year. This is manifested throughout Black Diamond Equipment’s hardware line with the evolution of camming devices from the original Camalot® to the modern Camalot® Ultralight. In avalanche safety Black Diamond Equipment debuted the AvaLung in 1999, the first device to allow a buried avalanche victim to breathe while buried, and in 2014 Black Diamond Equipment again broke the mold with the first jet-fan based airbag system, the JetForce. Our products have won nearly 40 awards from within the industry groups, from design media and consumer media including Backcountry, Backpacker, Blue Ridge Outdoors, Climbing, Forbes, Freeskier, National Geographic Adventure, Men’s Journal, Outside, Powder, Rock & Ice, Ski and Skiing.
 
Our products span 29 single product categories and include a wide variety of technical outdoor equipment and lifestyle products for rock and ice climbers, alpinists, hikers, skiers, and outdoor enthusiasts. We design many of our products for extreme applications, such as high altitude mountaineering, ice and rock climbing, as well as backcountry skiing and alpine touring. Generally, we divide our product offerings into the following three primary categories:
 

· | Climb: Our climb line consists of technical apparel, sportswear, and equipment such as belay/rappel devices, bouldering products, carabiners and quickdraws, chalk, chalk bags, climbing packs, crampons, crash pads, harnesses, technical and mountaineering ice axes, ice and rock protection devices, a bouldering line of technical apparel, and various other climbing accessories. Our climb line represented approximately 34% of our sales during the year ended December 31, 2016.

· | Ski: Our ski line consists of technical apparel, JetForce avalanche airbags, winter packs for skiing, bindings, poles, skis, skins, snow gloves, snow packs, and avalanche safety devices, including transceivers, probes, and shovels. Our ski line represented approximately 23% of our sales during the year ended December 31, 2016.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Mountain: Our mountain line consists of mountaineering backpacks for backpacking, expeditions, alpinism, and an array of day uses both in the outdoor environment and urban environments. We also offer gloves, headlamps, lights, tents, trekking poles, and various other hiking and mountaineering accessories. Our mountain line represented approximately 43% of our sales during the year ended December 31, 2016.

Product Design and Development
 
We are a company founded on innovation and believe that our success is uniquely tied to our ability to consistently introduce new product innovations across all of our brands. We have a long history of technical innovation and product development, introducing hundreds of new products since 1989, with over 100 patents and patents pending worldwide. In recent years, we have developed many innovative products that we believe have revolutionized the active outdoor space including: Helio™ Fixed Length Carbon ski pole, built with 100% inflation-molded carbon fiber for the ultimate combination of strength and lightweight performance; Camalot Ultralight, incorporating sculpted lobes and a patent-pending continuously looped Dyneema® core to replace the cable stem making them among the lightest camming units on the market; and JetForce, the first avalanche airbag that uses electronically controlled jet-fan inflation technology. We have been an innovator in trekking poles, introducing the first poles with FlickLock® technology that allow a single-handed locking mechanism and Z-Poles that can fold to one-third their size. Our innovations in lighting have re-defined the headlamp niche by taking simple components and combining them in a unique manner with a focus on recharge ability and protection from water.

Each person involved in our product design and development process shares a passion for the active outdoor sports that we serve and strives to develop and iterate new ideas. We conduct our product research and design activities at our locations in Salt Lake City, Utah, and Lebring, Austria, and conduct product evaluations at our offices located in Innsbruck, Austria.
 
Our employees’ passion and intimacy with our core outdoor activities helps foster new and innovative ideas. Our in-house research and development teams engage in all stages of planning, conceptualization, design, development, commercialization, and production. Our vertically integrated process allows our design team to conduct market research, brainstorm, plan product lines, prototype, and review designs before turning them over to our engineers to begin the development and production of the product. Quality assurance and control are a key component of our development process and products undergo rigorous in-house and field-testing at regular stages of the process. Our Salt Lake City headquarters, in the Wasatch Mountains, with a vibrant user community, provides the ideal backdrop for our employees to test our new products. Likewise, our European locations provide quick access to their products’ intended environments. Additionally, the athletes who endorse our products evaluate these products in the field and provide valuable feedback and suggestions to our designers. We believe this collaborative interaction helps preserve the brand image, authenticity, quality, and performance.
 
We typically bring new products from concept to market in approximately 24 to 36 months depending upon the technology integration and complexity of the product. We work simultaneously on product lines for the four subsequent selling seasons.
 
We expense research and development costs as incurred. As of December 31, 2016, we had 31 employees dedicated to research and development and have spent approximately $21.4 million in connection with research and development activities over the last three calendar years.
 
Customers
 
We market and distribute our products in over 50 countries, primarily through independent specialty stores and specialty chains, including premium sporting goods and outdoor recreation stores, in the United States, Canada, Europe, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, and South America. Outside of North America and Europe, we sell our products through independent global distributors into specialty retail stores. We also sell our products directly to customers through our wholly-owned retail store in Salt Lake City, Utah, as well as online at www.blackdiamondequipment.com.
 
We have long-standing relationships with our specialty retail customers and maintain our commitment to continue to sell through this channel. We have a diversified customer base and sell products in approximately 5,000 retail locations, with the bulk of our business being done through independent retailers.
 
Our end users include a broad range of consumers, including mountain, rock, ice, and gym climbers, winter outdoor enthusiasts, backpackers, and outdoor-inspired consumers. Such consumers demand high-quality, reliable, and well-designed products to enhance their performance and safety in a multitude of outdoor activities in virtually any climate. We expect to leverage our user intimacy, engineering prowess, and design ability to expand into related technical product categories that target the same demographic group and distribution channels.
 
During 2016, REI accounted for approximately 16% of our sales. The loss of this customer could have a material adverse effect on us.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We deploy our sales force by geographic region with a focus on providing our products to a broad spectrum of active outdoor enthusiasts. Within each of our brands, we strive to create a unique look and image for our products.
 
Our marketing strategy has a three-pronged approach: 1) maintain core credibility through sports and community marketing; 2) build brand awareness through digital marketing; and 3) drive sell-through via in-store marketing.
 
For the past 27 years, we’ve established and maintained ongoing relationships with professional athletes who excel at the sports of climbing, mountaineering, and skiing. These top athletes evaluate our products in the field with demanding use and under punishing conditions, providing valuable feedback and suggestions to our designers. They also promote our products at events, tradeshows and while in the field pursuing their sports. Finally, we believe they are invaluable at establishing brand authenticity with customers.
 
Our digital marketing is designed to increase consumer demand and awareness by connecting directly with our customer base as well as potential customers through www.blackdiamondequipment.com, www.pieps.com, and a variety of social media outlets. Our online flagship marketing vehicle is www.blackdiamondequipment.com, where we seek to give consumers in depth insight into our research and technology efforts, educate consumers, drive excitement for our products, and provide a memorable ecommerce experience for core athletes and beginners alike.

We continue to focus heavily on evolving our approach to social media and online marketing (email, paid and organic search) with the goal of increasing qualified visits to our websites. The broader goal remains to offer our customer a best-in-class, intuitive, and consistent two-way conversation that enables them to interact authentically with our brands. Part of this effort includes the development and nurturing of social media outlets as stand-alone Black Diamond® brand outposts. Our social media strategy is to leverage the strength of our growing fan bases as extremely well-targeted segments for brand-rich communications. These outposts engage our most enthusiastic brand advocates with product updates, information regarding our sponsored athletes, their accomplishments and in turn, better help us create a sense of brand community while reinforcing brand identity. This past year has seen Black Diamond grow its Facebook “Likes” by 20% to 300,000, and Instagram followers by 118% to 386,000. The progress in our online marketing programs enabled the online business to achieve growth of 24% year-over-year.
 
Manufacturing, Sourcing, Quality Assurance and Distribution
 
Manufacturing
 
Since the beginning of our history as a manufacturer of precisely engineered rock climbing equipment, we have grown in both capacity and capability. Our manufacturing operations have further professionalized and today are based on lean manufacturing principles. We still maintain the notion of craftsmanship melded into engineering as a driving force for what we manufacture.
 
Our objective is to deliver high quality products on-time, in the most cost efficient manner, and to support innovation to market. To achieve this, everyone in the organization is involved to continuously improve how we operate.
 
The Black Diamond Equipment and PIEPS manufacturing and distribution operations are ISO 9001–2008 certified by an independent certifying agency and are audited yearly by an independent certifying body to ensure Black Diamond Equipment’s and PIEPS’ quality management systems meet the requirements of ISO 9001–2008 and to ensure that Black Diamond Equipment’s and PIEPS’ certified products meet all necessary certification requirements.
 
We manufacture approximately 20% to 25% of our products, including nearly all climbing hard goods, in our facility in the United States. The remaining approximately 75% to 80% of our products are also manufactured to our specifications in third-party, independently-owned facilities. We keep employees and agents on-site or via regular visits at these third-party, independently owned facilities to ensure that our products are manufactured to meet our specifications. While we do not maintain a long-term manufacturing contract with those facilities, we believe that our long-term relationships with them will help to ensure that a sufficient supply of goods built to our specification are available in a timely manner and on satisfactory economic terms in the future.
 
Sourcing
 
We source raw materials and components from a variety of suppliers. Our primary raw materials include aluminum, steel, nylon, corrugated cardboard for packaging, metal, plastic and electrical components, and various textiles, foams, and fabrics. The raw materials and components used to manufacture our products are generally available from numerous suppliers in quantities sufficient to meet normal requirements.
 
We source packaging materials both domestically as well as from sources in Asia and Europe. We believe that all of our purchased products and materials could be readily obtained from alternative sources at comparable costs.
 
Quality Assurance
 
Quality assurance at the Company has two primary functions:
 

· | The first is to ensure that the products that we design and develop are manufactured to meet or exceed the Company’s own standards and international regulatory standards. This involves creating inspection documentation, reviewing manufacturing processes with our various vendor-partners, and inspecting finished product to assure it meets the rigorous standards required by our customers. These activities take place globally, wherever our products are manufactured.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The second function is to provide real and meaningful input to the new product development process. Quality assurance professionals interact closely with the design team and bring knowledge and expertise to the design process, ensuring that the products we bring to market truly meet the criteria established by the category director when a new product is envisioned.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The engineering prowess of the quality assurance group is a core competency that the Company seeks to leverage across all product lines and brands.

Our distribution model allows us to ship a broad cross-section of our product line in smaller quantities to our own global distribution centers and to those of our Independent Global Distributors (IGD) more frequently and at lower transportation and logistics costs.
Competition
 
Because of the diversity of our product offerings, we compete by niche with a variety of companies. Our products must stand up to the high standards set by the world’s elite mountain climbers, mountaineers, skiers, and adventurers. In the outdoor industry, quality and durability are paramount among these athletes who rely on our products to withstand some of the world’s most extreme conditions. In addition to extreme adventurers, we believe all outdoor enthusiasts benefit from the high-quality standards of our products. We also believe our products compete favorably on the basis of product innovation, product performance, marketing support, and price.
 
The popularity of various outdoor activities and changing design trends affect the desirability of our products. Therefore, we seek to anticipate and respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of available product offerings by developing new products with innovative performance features and designs, and by marketing our products in a persuasive and memorable fashion to drive consumer awareness and demand. Failure to anticipate or respond to consumer needs and preferences in a timely and adequate manner could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability.
 
We compete with niche, privately-owned companies as well as a number of brands owned by large multinational companies, such as those set forth below.
 

· | Climb: Our climbing products and accessories, such as belay devices, carabiners, and harnesses, compete with products from companies such as Arc’Teryx, Petzl, CAMP, EDELRID, and Mammut.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Ski: Our skiing apparel, equipment and accessories, such as technical apparel, skis, poles, avalanche airbags and transceivers, compete with products from competitors such as Arc’Teryx, Backcountry Access, Dynafit (Salewa), Dynastar (Lange), K2, Mammut, Marker, Nordica, Ortovox, Salomon, Scarpa, Scott, and Volkl.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Mountain: Our mountaineering products, such as backpacks, trekking poles, headlamps, and tents, compete with products from companies such as Petzl, Mammut, Deuter, Leki, Komperdell, Marmot, Mountain Hardwear, Osprey, Sierra Designs, and The North Face.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition, we compete with certain of our large wholesale customers who focus on the outdoor market, such as REI, Mountain Equipment Co-op and Decathlon, which manufacture, market and distribute their own climbing, mountaineering, and skiing products under their own private labels.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We believe our registered and pending word and icon trademarks worldwide, including the Black Diamond and Diamond “C” logos, Black Diamond®, ATC®, Camalot®, AvaLung®, FlickLock®, Ascension™, Time is Life®, Hexentric®, Stopper®, Dawn Patrol®, Bibler®, “Use.Design.Build.Engineer.Repeat”™, and PIEPS™, create international brand recognition for our products.
 
We believe our brands have an established reputation for high quality, reliability, and value, and accordingly, we actively monitor and police our brands against infringement to ensure their viability and enforceability.
 
In addition to trademarks, we hold over 100 patents and patents pending worldwide for a wide variety of technologies across our product lines.
 
Our success with our proprietary products is generally derived from our “first mover” advantage in the market as well as our commitment to protecting our current and future proprietary technologies and products, which acts as a deterrent to infringement of our intellectual property rights. While we believe our patent and trademark protection policies are robust and effective, if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, competitors may manufacture and market products similar to ours. Our principal intellectual property rights include our patents and trademarks but also include products containing proprietary trade secrets.
 
We cannot be sure that we will receive patents for any of our patent applications or that any existing or future patents that we receive or license will provide competitive advantages for our products. While we actively monitor our competitors to ensure that we do not compromise the intellectual property of others, we cannot be sure that competitors will not challenge, invalidate or void the application of any existing or future patents that we receive or license. In addition, patent rights may not prevent our competitors from developing, using or selling products that are in similar product niches as ours.

Seasonality
 
Our products are outdoor recreation related, which results in seasonal variations in sales and profitability. On a calendar year basis, we generally experience our greatest sales in the first and second quarters for certain of our products, including rock climbing gear, headlamps, helmets, lanterns, packs, trekking poles, and tents and in the third and fourth quarters for our technical apparel, ski, glove, snow safety, and ice climbing products. Sales of these products may be negatively affected by unfavorable weather conditions and other market trends. The fall/winter season represents approximately 55% of our sales while spring/summer represents approximately 45% of our sales.
 
Working capital requirements vary throughout the year. We fund our working capital through cash on hand and, if needed, the use of our line of credit facilities. Working capital typically increases during the first and third quarters of the year as inventory builds to support peak shipping periods and then typically decreases during the second and fourth quarters of the year as those inventories are sold and accounts receivable are collected. As of December 31, 2016, we had no amounts outstanding on our Zions First National Bank line of credit.
 
Environmental Matters
 
Our operations are subject to federal, state, and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those that impose workplace standards and regulate the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the handling, generation, emission, release, discharge, treatment, storage, and disposal of materials and substances including solid and hazardous wastes. We believe that we are in material compliance with such laws and regulations. Further, the cost of maintaining compliance has not, and we believe in the future, will not have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition. Due to the nature of our operations and the frequently changing nature of environmental compliance standards and technology, we cannot predict with any certainty that future material capital or operating expenditures will not be required in order to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, we had over 400 employees worldwide. None of our employees are represented by unions or covered by any collective bargaining agreements. We have not experienced any work stoppages or employee-related slowdowns and believe that our relationship with employees is satisfactory.
