 The restaurant market is fragmented,  we support major corporations and their franchisees, and businesses of all sizes, including single store operators. We believe our ability to offer comprehensive services including installation, maintenance, and technical support to a diverse set of customers differentiates us from our competitors.
 
Using a suite of software applications, our experienced service organization provides customers with knowledge based diagnostic solutions to resolve customer service issues. Our service providers compile information about potential customer or product trends and opportunities, and provide this information to our remote service technicians, to assist them in diagnosing issues occurring at customer locations, in real-time; reducing the need for physical on-site service calls.  Our customer relationship management system allows our call center personnel to maintain customer profiles, including customer hardware and software details, service history, and database of problem-resolutions, to maximize our service resolution effectiveness and customer satisfaction.
 
We work closely with our customers to identify and address the latest restaurant or retail technology requirements by creating interfaces to the latest innovations in operational equipment, including Europay, MasterCard and Visa (EMV), digital, and additional solutions located inside and outside of the customer’s premises. PAR provides systems integration expertise to interface specialized components, including but not limited to video monitors, wireless networks, and video surveillance, to meet requirements of its global customers.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
 In the U.S., we market and sell our products through our dedicated sales teams, who directly interface with our tier 1 customers (owner and/or operator of 2,000 or more sites), tier 2 customers (owner and/or operator of 101-1,999 sites) and tier 3 customers (owner and/or operator of a 2 – 100 sites).

Both Wegmans and Wal-Mart selected the SureCheck solution to food safety and task management requirements.
 
Competition
 
 POS software and hardware offerings to the restaurant and retail markets is highly competitive. Most of our significant customers have several approved suppliers of software and/or hardware similar to one or more of our products. We compete directly with some product offerings from Oracle Corporation, NCR Corporation, and Panasonic Corporation among others. We compete on the basis of product delivery (cloud based software applications v. traditional), product design, features and functionality, quality and reliability, price, and customer service. Our competitive advantages include our integrated solutions offerings, including our cloud (SaaS delivery model) and on-premise software, ergonomic purpose-built hardware, advanced development capabilities, extensive domain knowledge and expertise, excellent product reliability, a customer dedicated direct sales force organization, and world class and responsive customer service and support.
 
The markets that are the focus of SureCheck are immature and there are currently few competitors.  However, as the functionality and efficiencies of the SureCheck solution become more known and demonstrable, we will face competition in this product offering category as well.

 Manufacturing and Suppliers
 
 We assemble our ES 8000 series of hardware internally as well as source hardware products and hardware related components from third parties. Although we purchase most of the materials, supplies, product sub-assemblies and full assemblies for our internal assembling of products from several suppliers, we do rely on sole sources for certain of our assembly components and hardware products. As a result, we periodically review and evaluate potential risks of disruption to our supply chain operations in the event one or more supplier should fail to perform.
Government Segment:
 
PAR’s Government segment provides a range of solutions and services for the U.S. Department of Defense (“DoD”) and federal agencies. It is focused on two principal offerings – Solutions and Services; and Mission Support.

Marketing and Competition
 
We obtain contracts primarily through competitive proposals in response to solicitations from government organizations and prime contractors. In addition, PAR sometimes obtains contracts by submitting unsolicited proposals. Although we believe we are well positioned in our business areas, competition for government contracts is intense. Many of our competitors are major corporations, or subsidiaries thereof, that are significantly larger and have substantially greater financial resources. We also compete with many smaller, economically disadvantaged companies, many of which are designated by the government for preferential “set aside” treatment, that target particular segments of the government contract market. The principal competitive factors are past performance, the ability to perform the statement of work, price, technological capabilities, management capabilities and service. Many of our department of defense customers are migrating to low-price/technically acceptable procurements while leveraging commercial software standards, applications, and solutions.
Backlog
 
The value of existing Government contracts at December 31, 2016, net of amounts relating to work performed to that date, was approximately $126.0 million, of which $36.4 million was funded. The value of existing Government contracts at December 31, 2015, net of amounts relating to work performed to that date, was approximately $101.2 million, of which $48.4 million was funded. Funded amounts represent those amounts committed under contract by Government agencies and prime contractors.  The December 31, 2016 Government contract backlog of $126.0 million represents firm, existing contracts.  Of this backlog amount, approximately $55.4 million is expected to be completed in calendar year 2017, as funding is committed.
Intellectual Property and Other Rights
 
We develop a substantial amount of our products internally as original developments, discoveries and know-how or based on existing copyrighted works and/or patents issued or pending of PAR or third party licensors.  We have a number of U.S. and foreign patents and patents pending and trademarks, as well as copyrights that relate to internally developed software, various distinctive characteristics of our products, including certain attributes, functionality, and brand association and goodwill. In addition to our publicly available intellectual property, we possess competitive confidential information and trade secrets.  We protect our intellectual property and other proprietary information by actively pursuing U.S. and foreign patent and trademark protection of our proprietary product developments, discoveries and know-how and our brands and logos, and by entering into license agreements and non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements.
