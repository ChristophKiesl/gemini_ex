Item 1. Business.
Overview



We are a Delaware blank check company incorporated in October 2020 whose business purpose is to effect our initial business combination.



While we may pursue an initial business combination opportunity in any business, industry, sector or geographical location, we are currently focusing on the restaurant, hospitality, food and beverage, retail, consumer, food and food related technology and real estate industries such as “proptech,” including sectors that service or are connected to these industries in the United States and other developed countries. These industries complement our leadership team’s extensive background and we are capitalizing on the ability of our leadership team to identify and acquire a target business in such sectors.



We are focusing our initial business combination efforts, such as the EUR Business Combination, on targets that (i) have strong brand and business fundamentals; (ii) may have been adversely affected by COVID-related shutdowns, but have a definable path forward; (iii) will benefit from our leadership team’s expertise in creating, building, marketing, distributing, leading and monetizing brands and products; (iv) will likely benefit from enhanced data gathering to support cross-channel distribution; and (v) can serve as a platform company to make future bolt-on acquisitions.



Initial Public Offering



On November 8, 2021, we consummated our initial public offering of 15,500,000 units. Each unit consists of one share of common stock, and one-half of one redeemable warrant of the Company, with each warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of common stock for $11.50 per whole share. The units were sold at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $155,000,000.



Simultaneously with the closing of the initial public offering, we completed the private sale of an aggregate of 770,000 shares to our sponsor at a purchase price of $10.00 per private placement share, generating gross proceeds of $7,700,000.



A total of $158,100,000, comprised of $152,805,604 of the proceeds from the initial public offering and $5,294,396 of the proceeds of the sale of the private placement shares was placed in the trust account maintained by Continental, acting as trustee.



Our management team is led by Steve Salis, our Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, and Jamie Karson, our Non-Executive Vice-Chairman of the Board of Directors. We must complete our initial business combination by August 8, 2023, which is the end of the Combination Period. If our initial business combination is not consummated by August 8, 2023, then our existence will terminate, and we will distribute all amounts in the trust account.



EUR Business Combination



On October 24, 2022, the Company, entered into the EUR Merger Agreement. Capitalized terms not defined but otherwise used in the following description have the meanings ascribed to them in the EUR Merger Agreement.



Subject to its terms and conditions, the EUR Merger Agreement provides that the Company and ELAT will become wholly-owned subsidiaries of PubCo, a newly formed holding company. Pursuant to the EUR Merger Agreement, at the Closing, (a) Pubco will acquire all of the issued and outstanding capital shares of ELAT from EUR in exchange for Pubco Ordinary Shares, and any shares EUR holds in Pubco shall be surrendered for no consideration, such that ELAT becomes a wholly owned subsidiary of Pubco and EUR becomes a shareholder of Pubco, which we refer to as the Share Exchange; and immediately thereafter (b) Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving entity and wholly owned subsidiary of Pubco.

Merger Consideration



Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the EUR Merger Agreement, in connection with the Effective Time of the Business Combination:




(i) | each of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock will be exchanged for the right to receive one Pubco Ordinary Share (and following such exchange the share of the Company’s common stock will be cancelled);

Additional Pubco Ordinary Shares will be contingently issuable to EUR, in the form of an earnout which is subject to certain terms and conditions relating to the price of Pubco Ordinary Shares, during the five year period following the consummation of the Business Combination, and which we refer to as the Earnout Shares. The Earnout Shares represent a number of Pubco Ordinary Shares equal to up to 10% of the Closing Share Consideration, and half (or 5%) are issuable if Pubco Ordinary Shares’ VWAP (as defined in the EUR Merger Agreement) trade above $15 dollars per share, and the other half (or 5%) are issuable if such price for Pubco Ordinary Shares trade above $20 per share, in each case for any twenty trading days in any thirty day trading days during this period.



Representations and Warranties



The EUR Merger Agreement contains customary representations and warranties by each of the Company, ELAT, EUR, Pubco and the Merger Sub. Many of the representations and warranties are qualified by materiality or Material Adverse Effect. “Material Adverse Effect” as used in the EUR Merger Agreement means with respect to the relevant party, subject to certain customary exceptions, any event, state of facts, condition, change, development, circumstance, occurrence or effect that, individually or in the aggregate, has had, or would reasonably be expected to have, a materially adverse effect on the business, assets, financial condition or results of operations of the Company or ELAT and its subsidiaries, as applicable, taken as a whole. Certain of the representations are subject to specified exceptions and qualifications contained in the EUR Merger Agreement or in information provided pursuant to certain disclosure schedules to the EUR Merger Agreement.



Covenants of the Parties



The EUR Merger Agreement contains certain customary covenants for transactions of this type by each of the parties during the period between the signing of the EUR Merger Agreement and the earlier of the Closing or the termination of the EUR Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms.



ELAT and EUR also agreed to cooperate in good faith and use reasonable best efforts to obtain any consents required and to transfer certain contracts from EUR to ELAT to enter into a new contract with the applicable counterparty on substantially identical terms to such contracts.



EUR agreed that its board of directors will not withhold, withdraw or modify its recommendation that ELAT’s stockholders vote in favor of the approval of the EUR Merger Agreement and the Business Combination and other matters relating thereto unless the ELAT’s board of directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its legal and financial advisors, that it is required to do so in order to comply with its fiduciary duties under applicable law (and then only subject to certain requirements).

The parties also agreed to ensure Pubco’s board of directors immediately after the Closing consists of five directors, a majority of which will be independent under the requirements of the Nasdaq Global Market (“Nasdaq”) (i) with ELAT being entitled to nominate and appoint four directors (of which at least two will qualify as independent under the requirements of Nasdaq and be eligible to serve on an audit committee) and (ii) with the Company being entitled to nominate and appoint one member to be reasonably approved by ELAT (such member being qualified as independent and being eligible to serve on an audit committee).



The parties further agreed that prior to the Closing, Pubco will approve and adopt, subject to the Company’s stockholder approval, (i) an incentive equity plan (the “Incentive Equity Plan”), and (ii) an employee stock purchase plan (the “ESPP”), in each case effective as of one business day prior to the Closing Date. The Incentive Equity Plan will have an initial share reserve ranging from 5% to 10% of the outstanding number of Pubco Ordinary Shares immediately following the Closing, plus an annual “evergreen” increase, which in each case will be based upon benchmarking against peer companies in consultation with an independent outside compensation advisor. The ESPP will have an initial share reserve of no more than 2% of the outstanding number of Pubco Ordinary Shares immediately following the Closing and an annual “evergreen” increase based upon benchmarking against peer companies in consultation with an independent outside compensation advisor.



The Company, EUR and Pubco also agreed to jointly prepare, and Pubco will file with the SEC, the EUR Registration Statement with respect to the Pubco Ordinary Shares that constitute Merger Consideration and the Pubco warrants. The EUR Registration Statement will include a proxy statement/prospectus for the purpose of soliciting proxies from the Company’s stockholders for the matters relating to the Business Combination to be acted on at the special meeting of the Company’s stockholders and providing such stockholders with an opportunity to participate in the Redemption. EUR agreed to prepare (with the Company’s reasonable cooperation) and file with the ASX (at the sole cost and expense of EUR) the circular to be provided to the shareholders of EUR relating to the EUR Shareholders’ Meeting.



Survival and Indemnification



None of the representations and warranties of the parties to the EUR Merger Agreement will survive the Closing, and no claim for indemnification may be made with respect thereto after the Closing.



None of the covenants and agreements of the parties contained in the EUR Merger Agreement will survive the Closing, and no claim for indemnification may be made with respect thereto after the Closing, except that those covenants and agreements that by their terms are required to be performed in whole or in part after the Closing will survive the Closing and continue until fully performed in accordance with their terms.



Conditions to Closing



The EUR Merger Agreement contains customary conditions to Closing, including the following mutual conditions of the parties (unless waived by all of the parties): (i) approval of the shareholders of EUR and the Company’s stockholders of the Business Combination and the other matters requiring shareholder approval; (ii) any required approvals of governmental authorities and completion of any antitrust expiration periods; (iii) no law or order preventing the Business Combination; (iv) approval of Pubco’s Nasdaq listing application; (v) the EUR Registration Statement having become effective in accordance with the Securities Act, without any stop order or proceeding seeking such a stop order threatened or initiated by the SEC which remains pending; (vi) the satisfaction of the $5,000,001 minimum net tangible asset test by the Company or Pubco; (vii) appointment of directors to the Pubco Board as contemplated under the EUR Merger Agreement; (viii) adoption of the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association of Pubco by the shareholders of Pubco; and (ix) Pubco qualifying as a “foreign private issuer” pursuant to rule 3b-4 of the Exchange Act as of the Closing.

Unless waived by the Company, the obligations of the Company to consummate the Transaction are subject to the satisfaction of the following additional Closing conditions, in addition to the delivery by ELAT and Merger Sub of customary certificates and other Closing deliverables: (i) the representations and warranties of ELAT, EUR, Pubco and Merger Sub being true and correct as of the date of the EUR Merger Agreement and as of the Closing (subject to a qualifier as to material adverse effect, other than with respect to specified fundamental representations and warranties), except that a representation and warranty relating to an absence of an ELAT material adverse effect (as defined in the EUR Merger Agreement) and absence of certain changes and events in each case is required to be true and correct only as of the date of the EUR Merger Agreement; (ii) ELAT, PubCo, Merger Sub and EUR having performed all agreements and covenants required by the EUR Merger Agreement required to be performed by it at or prior to the Closing Date, in each case in all material respects; (iii) no change, event state of facts, development or occurrence shall have occurred since the date of the EUR Merger Agreement, that individually or in the aggregate with all other change, events, state of facts, developments or occurrences, has had or would reasonably be expected to have an ELAT material adverse effect (as defined in the EUR Merger Agreement) that is continuing; and (iv) each of the Investors Agreement, Lock-Up Agreement and Registration Rights Agreement shall be in full force and effect as of the Closing.



Termination



The EUR Merger Agreement may be terminated under certain customary and limited circumstances at any time prior to the Closing, including: (i) by mutual written consent of the Company and ELAT; (ii) by written notice by either the Company or ELAT if the Closing has not occurred on or prior to May 3, 2023 (the “Outside Date”), other than by a party whose action or failure to act constitutes a material breach of the EUR Merger Agreement and has been a principal cause of the failure of the Business Combination to occur; (iii) by either the Company or ELAT in the event of the other party’s uncured breach of a representation, warranty covenant or agreement in the EUR Merger Agreement (or with respect to the Company, a breach by the Company or Sponsor of the Sponsor Support Agreement), if such breach would result in the failure of the related closing condition of that party in the EUR Merger Agreement, following 30 days written notice to the other party of that party’s breach, which breach remains uncured, or following the Outside Date if the other party exercised reasonable best efforts to cure such breach, other than by a party whose action or failure to act resulted in a breach of the applicable closing condition; (iv) by either the Company or ELAT, if the Company holds the Special Meeting (including any postponement or adjournment of the meeting) in which a vote is taken and the required approvals of the Company’s stockholders relating to the EUR Merger Agreement and Business Combination are not obtained in accordance with applicable law and the Company’s organizational documents; (v) by ELAT, if the Company’s Board has changed or fail to make as applicable its approval of the EUR Merger Agreement and Business Combination or its resolution to recommend to the Company’s stockholders to vote at a special meeting in favor of the adoption of the EUR Merger Agreement in accordance with the DGCL; (vi) by EUR, in order to substantially concurrently enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a superior proposal, if EUR has paid to the Company the Expense Reimbursement; (vii) by the Company, prior to the approval of EUR shareholders of the EUR Merger Agreement and the Business Combination, if (A) there has occurred a EUR Adverse Recommendation Change, or (B) at any time after a EUR Competing Proposal has been publicly proposed or publicly announced the board of directors of EUR has failed to publicly affirm the EUR Board Recommendation within 10 business days (after one written request by the Company relating to any proposal or publicly disclosed material amendment to such proposal), provided that the Company has exercised this termination right within 10 business days after being entitled to do so under this section; (ix) by the Company, if ELAT has not delivered audited financials, for the years ended June 30, 2021 and 2022, on or prior to December 31, 2022 (unless the Company has not exercised this termination right and ELAT delivers such audited financials); (x) by ELAT, if the Minimum Cash Condition is not anticipated to be met, as reasonably determined by ELAT following the conclusion of an extension meeting to extend the time period for the Company to consummate a business combination; or (x) by the Company, if an ELAT material adverse effect (as defined in the EUR Merger Agreement) following the date of the EUR Merger Agreement is uncured and continuing for at least 30 days.





4







If the EUR Merger Agreement is terminated, all further obligations of the parties under the EUR Merger Agreement (except for certain obligations related to publicity, confidentiality and access to information, waiver of claims against the Trust Account, transaction litigation, termination and related fees and general provisions) will terminate, and no party to the EUR Merger Agreement will have any further liability to any other party thereto except for liability for willful breach.



If the Company terminates the EUR Merger Agreement because of an EUR Adverse Recommendation Change (as defined above) or EUR terminates as a result of a superior proposal, in each case, ELAT will pay the Company $5 million as expense reimbursement, which we refer to as the Expense Reimbursement Fee. If the Merger Agreement is terminated when an EUR Competing Proposal has been publicly announced or disclosed and not abandoned, and EUR enters into a definitive agreement relating to such EUR Competing Proposal within twelve months of such termination, then EUR will pay the Company the Expense Reimbursement Fee.



Trust Account Waiver



ELAT and EUR each agreed that they and their affiliates will not have any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies in the Company’s trust account (including any distributions therefrom) held for its public stockholders, and agreed not to, and waived any right to, make any claim against the trust account (including any distributions therefrom to Company’s public stockholders).

This amendment further provided that, in the event of the consummation of the Business Combination, EUR would be reimbursed by Pubco for ELAT transaction expenses, and clarified that Pubco would be responsible for the Company’s transaction expenses and ELAT transaction expenses (in each case as defined in the EUR Merger Agreement) incurred or paid prior to Closing upon consummation of the Business Combination.

The sponsor also agreed to take certain other actions in support of the EUR Merger Agreement and the EUR Business Combination and to refrain from taking such actions that would adversely impede the ability of the parties to perform the EUR Merger Agreement. The Sponsor Support Agreement also prevents transfers of Company securities held by the sponsor between the date of the Sponsor Support Agreement and the date of the Closing or earlier termination of the EUR Merger Agreement unless the transferee executes a joinder to the Sponsor Support Agreement. The Sponsor also agreed to surrender 2,049,250 shares of Company Common Stock to the Company for no consideration immediately prior to Closing.

Pursuant to the Lock-Up Agreement, the Sponsor and EUR agreed not to, during the period commencing from the Closing and ending 180 days after the date of the Closing: (A) sell, publicly offer to sell, enter into a contract or agreement to sell, hypothecation or pledge of, grant of any option to purchase or otherwise disposition of or agreement to dispose of, in each case, directly or indirectly, or establishment or increase of a put equivalent position or liquidation with respect to or decrease of a call equivalent position with respect to, any security, (B) enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of any security, whether any such transaction is to be settled by delivery of such securities, in cash or otherwise or (C) publicly announce any intention to effect any transaction specified in clause (A) or (B), any Lock-up Shares (in each case, subject to certain limited permitted transfers where the recipient takes the shares subject to the restrictions in the Lock-Up Agreement). “Lock-up Shares” means (a) with respect to EUR or each of its permitted transferees, the Pubco Ordinary Shares (i) received by EUR as Closing Share Consideration and (ii) received by EUR as Earnout Consideration and (b) with respect to the Sponsor, (i) the Pubco Ordinary Shares it receives as Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Company common stock that the Sponsor held immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) any Pubco Ordinary Shares issued to the Sponsor in connection with the exercise or settlement of any Company warrant or Pubco warrant.



A copy of the Lock-Up Agreement is filed as Exhibit 10.10 to this Report and is incorporated herein by reference, and the foregoing description of the Lock-Up Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference thereto.



Investors Agreement

Warrant Assignment, Assumption and Amendment Agreement



In connection with the Closing, PubCo, the Company and Continental, as warrant agent, will enter into the Warrant Assignment, Assumption and Amendment Agreement (the “Assumed Warrant Agreement”), which will amend that certain Warrant Agreement (the “Original Warrant Agreement”), dated as of November 3, 2021, and filed with the SEC on November 8, 2021, by and between the Company and Continental, which Original Warrant Agreement governs all of the Warrants issued by the Company. Pursuant to the Assumed Warrant Agreement, the Company will assign to PubCo all of the Company’s right, title and interest in and to the Original Warrant Agreement and PubCo will assume, and agree to pay, perform, satisfy and discharge in full, as the same become due, all of the Company’s liabilities and obligations under the Original Warrant Agreement, as amended. As a result, each public warrant will automatically cease to represent a right to be exercised into shares of the Company stock and will instead represent a right to be exercised into PubCo Shares pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Original Warrant Agreement, as amended.

Other than as specifically discussed, this Report does not assume the Closing of the EUR Business Combination.



Extension Amendment and Redemptions



On February 1, 2023, we held a special meeting of stockholders and approved, among other things, the Extension Amendment, which extended the date by which we must consummate a business combination from February 8, 2023 to August 8, 2023 (or such earlier date as determined by the board). In connection with the Extension Amendment, shareholders holding 11,076,703 shares of common stock exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the trust account. We paid cash in the aggregate amount of $114.3 million, or approximately $10.32 per share to redeeming shareholders in the Extension Redemptions. For each one-month extension our sponsor will deposit in the trust account a Contribution of $200,000 in the aggregate for shares of common stock not redeemed in connection with the Extension Amendment. The first Contribution was made on February 6, 2023 and subsequent Contributions are payable monthly through the Company’s extension date in August 2023 (if we fully extend the term we have to complete our initial business combination). Our board has the sole discretion whether to continue extending for additional calendar months until August 8, 2023, the end of the Combination Period.
Industry Opportunity 



While we may acquire a business in any industry, such as the EUR Business Combination, our focus was in the restaurant, retail, consumer, tech, real estate, and hospitality industries. The leadership team has had demonstrable success over a period of years creating, buying and managing businesses in these industries. The leadership team has demonstrated an ability to spot undervalued assets in one or more of these industries. We also believe that businesses in these industries represent opportunities for growth and consolidation over the next 12-24 month period. Sales by businesses in these industries have been materially and adversely affected by COVID. While we expect overall rents to decrease as a percentage of sales, this will be offset by increased labor and increased operating costs due to high third-party delivery costs which represents a larger portion of the typical revenue mix. Revenue choppiness combined with increased costs will result in a number of companies and their owners weighing their strategic alternatives.
Acquisition Criteria



Consistent with our strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, including the EUR Business Combination, but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that meets some, but not all of these criteria and guidelines.

● | Large Market Opportunity. We are seeking to acquire one or more businesses that operate in large addressable markets. We believe operating in these market segments will create the opportunity for significant growth, including those with embedded or underexploited growth opportunities and those that may benefit from synergistic bolt-on acquisitions, new product markets and geographies, increased production capacity, expense reduction and increased operating leverage. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Strong Potential Competitive Position. We are focusing on acquisition targets that have the potential to develop a leading, growing or significant niche market position in their respective industries and that can form the foundation to add additional companies in the future. We are analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of target businesses relative to their competitors. We are seeking to acquire one or more businesses that we believe have the ability to demonstrate advantages such as improvements to quality of care or significant measurable cost savings when compared to their competitors, which may help to develop and increase their market position and profitability. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------






7








● | Experienced Management Team. We are seeking to acquire one or more businesses with a complete and experienced management team that provides a platform for us to further develop the acquired company. We are seeking to partner with a potential target’s management team and expect that the operating and financial abilities of our leadership team will complement the acquired company’s existing capabilities. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Benefit from Being a Public Company. We intend to acquire one or more businesses that will benefit from being publicly traded and can effectively utilize the broader access to capital and the public profile that are associated with being a publicly traded company. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Strong Cash Flow. We are focusing on targets with cash flow metrics equal to or exceeding its public company competitors and which demonstrate a clear path to gaining market share and profitable growth. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Opportunity For Broader Consolidation. We are focusing on companies in underpenetrated market segments and distribution channels and present expansion opportunities for their existing brands. We are seeking to obtain high-level efficiencies for back-office, including but not limited to purchasing, HR, accounting and finance and construction management. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Strong Millennial/Gen Z Consumers Base; Use of Data. We believe that target companies with a core base of millennial and Gen Z consumers attract consumers of all different age groups. We believe that once the millennial and Gen Z consumer develops brand loyalty they will market the concept or product through social media platforms thus creating brand buzz on a cost efficient basis. We also believe that the use of data in consumer-facing businesses is becoming increasing important. We intend to find a suitable target where data collection around consumer preferences could potentially result in increased guest frequency, higher per person check averages and ultimately, higher revenues. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that from time to time our leadership may deem relevant.



Effecting a Business Combination



We will either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, such as the EUR Business Combination, at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination or do not vote at all, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), or (2) provide our stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of our proposed business combination or allow stockholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek stockholder approval. If we decide to allow stockholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer, we will file tender offer documents with the SEC that will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination as is required under the SEC’s proxy rules. We will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 immediately prior to or upon consummation of such business combination and, if we seek stockholder approval, unless otherwise required by applicable law, regulation or stock exchange rules, a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination. We have no specified maximum percentage threshold for conversions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and even those public stockholders who vote in favor of our initial business combination have the right to convert their public shares. As a result, this may make it easier for us to consummate our initial business combination.





8







We will have until August 8, 2023 to consummate an initial business combination. If we are unable to consummate an initial business combination within such time period, we will redeem 100% of our outstanding public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the trust account, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our tax obligations, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to applicable law and as further described herein, and then seek to dissolve and liquidate. We expect the pro rata redemption price to be approximately $10.20 per share of common stock, without taking into account any interest earned on such funds. However, we cannot assure you that we will in fact be able to distribute such amounts as a result of claims of creditors which may take priority over the claims of our public stockholders.



Fair Market Value of Target Business



Nasdaq listing rules require that the target business or businesses that we acquire must collectively have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance of the funds in the trust account (excluding deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination. Based on the valuation analysis of our management and board of directors, we have determined that the fair market value of EUR was substantially in excess of 80% of the funds in the trust account and that the 80% test was therefore satisfied. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we are not then listed on Nasdaq for whatever reason, we would no longer be required to meet the foregoing 80% fair market value test.



We currently anticipate structuring a business combination to acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination where we merge directly with the target business or a newly formed subsidiary or where we acquire less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we could acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target; however, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of trust account balance test.



The fair market value of the target will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community (such as actual and potential sales, earnings, cash flow and/or book value). The proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents used by us in connection with any proposed transaction will provide public stockholders with our analysis of the fair market value of the target business, as well as the basis for our determinations. If our board is not able to independently determine that the target business has a sufficient fair market value, we will obtain an opinion from an unaffiliated, independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We will not be required to obtain an opinion from an investment banking firm as to the fair market value if our board of directors independently determines that the target business complies with the 80% threshold. Based on the valuation analysis of our leadership and board of directors, we have determined that the fair market value of EUR was substantially in excess of 80% of the funds in the trust account and that the 80% test was therefore satisfied.

Lack of Business Diversification



We may seek to effect a business combination with more than one target business, although we expect to complete our business combination with just one business, such as EUR. Therefore, at least initially, the prospects for our success may be entirely dependent upon the future performance of a single business operation. Unlike other entities which may have the resources to complete several business combinations of entities operating in multiple industries or multiple areas of a single industry, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses. By consummating a business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

● | subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to a business combination, and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | result in our dependency upon the performance of a single operating business or the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




If we determine to simultaneously acquire several businesses and such businesses are owned by different sellers, we will need for each of such sellers to agree that our purchase of its business is contingent on the simultaneous closings of the other acquisitions, which may make it more difficult for us, and delay our ability, to complete the business combination. With multiple acquisitions, we could also face additional risks, including additional burdens and costs with respect to possible multiple negotiations and due diligence investigations (if there are multiple sellers) and the additional risks associated with the subsequent assimilation of the operations and services or products of the acquired companies in a single operating business.



Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target Business’ Management



Although we scrutinize the management of a prospective target business, including the management team of EUR, when evaluating the desirability of effecting a business combination, and plan to continue to do so if the EUR Business Combination is not consummated and we seek other business combination opportunities, we cannot assure you that our assessment of the target business’ management will prove to be correct. In addition, we cannot assure you that the future management will have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of our officers and directors, if any, in the target business following a business combination cannot presently be stated with any certainty. While it is possible that some of our key personnel will remain associated in senior management or advisory positions with us following a business combination, it is unlikely that they will devote their full-time efforts to our affairs subsequent to a business combination. Moreover, they would only be able to remain with the company after the consummation of a business combination if they are able to negotiate employment or consulting agreements in connection with the business combination. Such negotiations would take place simultaneously with the negotiation of the business combination and could provide for them to receive compensation in the form of cash payments and/or our securities for services they would render to the company after the consummation of the business combination. While the personal and financial interests of our key personnel may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business, their ability to remain with the company after the consummation of a business combination will not be the determining factor in our decision as to whether or not we will proceed with any potential business combination. Additionally, we cannot assure you that our officers and directors will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.



Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that any such additional managers we do recruit will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.



Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve an Initial Business Combination



In connection with any proposed business combination, including the EUR Business Combination, we will either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination or do not vote at all, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), or (2) provide our stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or will allow stockholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek stockholder approval. If we determine to engage in a tender offer, such tender offer will be structured so that each stockholder may tender all of his, her or its shares rather than some pro rata portion of his, her or its shares. In that case, we will file tender offer documents with the SEC which will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination as is required under the SEC’s proxy rules. Whether we seek stockholder approval or engage in a tender offer, we will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 immediately prior to or upon consummation of such business combination and, if we seek stockholder approval, unless otherwise required by applicable law, regulation or stock exchange rules, a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination. We have no specified maximum percentage threshold for redemptions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and even those public stockholders who vote in favor of our initial business combination have the right to redeem their public shares. As a result, this may make it easier for us to consummate our initial business combination.





10







We chose our net tangible asset threshold of $5,000,001 to ensure that we would avoid being subject to Rule 419 promulgated under the Securities Act. However, if we seek to consummate an initial business combination with a target business that imposes any type of working capital closing condition or requires us to have a minimum amount of funds available from the trust account upon consummation of such initial business combination, we may need to have more than $5,000,001 in net tangible assets immediately prior to or upon consummation and this may force us to seek third party financing which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. As a result, we may not be able to consummate such initial business combination and we may not be able to locate another suitable target within the applicable time period, if at all. Public stockholders may therefore have to wait until August 8, 2023 in order to be able to receive a pro rata share of the trust account.



Our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed (1) to vote any shares of common stock owned by them in favor of any proposed business combination, (2) not to convert any shares of common stock in connection with a stockholder vote to approve a proposed initial business combination and (3) not sell any shares of common stock in any tender in connection with a proposed initial business combination.



None of our officers, directors, sponsor, or their affiliates has purchased units or shares of common stock in our initial public offering, or has since indicated any intention to do so from persons in the open market or in private transactions. However, if we hold a meeting to approve a proposed business combination and a significant number of stockholders vote, or indicate an intention to vote, against such proposed business combination or that they wish to convert their shares, our officers, directors, sponsor, or their affiliates could make such purchases in the open market or in private transactions in order to influence the vote and reduce the number of conversions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our officers, directors, sponsor, and their affiliates will not make purchases of shares of common stock if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act, which are rules designed to stop potential manipulation of a company’s stock.



See “EUR Business Combination” above for more information on the requisite approvals for the EUR Business Combination.



Conversion Rights



At any meeting called to approve an initial business combination, such as the EUR Business Combination, public stockholders may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination or do not vote at all, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, less any taxes then due but not yet paid. Alternatively, we may provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares of our common stock to us through a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, less any taxes then due but not yet paid.



Our sponsor, initial stockholders and our officers and directors will not have conversion rights with respect to any shares of common stock owned by them, directly or indirectly, whether acquired prior to our initial public offering or purchased by them in our initial public offering or in the aftermarket.





11







We may require public stockholders, whether they are a record holder or hold their shares in “street name,” to either (i) tender their certificates to our transfer agent or (ii) deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using the DWAC System, at the holder’s option, in each case prior to a date set forth in the proxy materials sent in connection with the proposal to approve the business combination. There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced delivery process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker a nominal amount and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise conversion rights. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising conversion rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. However, in the event we require stockholders seeking to exercise conversion rights prior to the consummation of the proposed business combination and the proposed business combination is not consummated this may result in an increased cost to stockholders.



Any proxy solicitation materials we furnish to stockholders in connection with a vote for any proposed business combination will indicate whether we are requiring stockholders to satisfy such certification and delivery requirements. Accordingly, a stockholder would have from the time the stockholder received our proxy statement up until the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination to deliver his shares if he wishes to seek to exercise his conversion rights. This time period varies depending on the specific facts of each transaction. However, as the delivery process can be accomplished by the stockholder, whether or not he is a record holder or his shares are held in “street name,” in a matter of hours by simply contacting the transfer agent or his broker and requesting delivery of his shares through the DWAC System, we believe this time period is sufficient for an average investor. However, we cannot assure you of this fact.



Any request to convert such shares once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the vote on the proposed business combination or the expiration of the tender offer. Furthermore, if a holder of public shares delivered his certificate in connection with an election of their conversion and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, he may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically).



If the initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their conversion rights would not be entitled to convert their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any shares delivered by public holders.



See “EUR Business Combination” above for more information on any conversion rights associated with the EUR Business Combination.



Liquidation if No Business Combination



Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, provides that we will have only the Combination Period, or until August 8, 2023, to complete an initial business combination, such as the EUR Business Combination. If we have not completed the EUR Business Combination or another initial business combination by such date, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including any interest not previously released to us but net of taxes payable, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Leadership believes that this condition raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.





12







Our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that would affect our public stockholders’ ability to convert or sell their shares to us in connection with a business combination as described herein or affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete a business combination within the Combination Period unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to convert their shares of common stock upon such approval at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest not previously released to us but net of franchise and income taxes payable, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. This redemption right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by our sponsor, executive officers, directors or any other person.



Under the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of 100% of our outstanding public shares in the event we do not complete the EUR Business Combination, or another initial business combination within the Combination Period may be considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. It is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following the end of the Combination Period, and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date.



Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of 100% of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period is not considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidation distribution.



Because we will not be complying with Section 280 of the DGCL, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent ten years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses.



We are required to seek to have all third parties (including any vendors or other entities we engage after our initial public offering) and any prospective target businesses enter into agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account. As a result, the claims that could be made against us will be limited, thereby lessening the likelihood that any claim would result in any liability extending to the trust. We therefore believe that any necessary provision for creditors will be reduced and should not have a significant impact on our ability to distribute the funds in the trust account to our public stockholders. Nevertheless, Marcum, our independent registered public accounting firm, and the underwriters of our initial public offering, will not execute agreements with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that other vendors, service providers and prospective target businesses will execute such agreements. Nor is there any guarantee that, even if they execute such agreements with us, they will not seek recourse against the trust account. Our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to ensure that the proceeds in the trust account are not reduced below $10.20 per share by the claims of target businesses or claims of vendors or other entities that are owed money by us for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to us, but we cannot assure you that it will be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations if it is required to do so. We have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that our sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we believe it is unlikely that our sponsor will be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations if it is required to do so. Additionally, the agreement our sponsor entered into specifically provides for two exceptions to the indemnity it has given: it will have no liability (1) as to any claimed amounts owed to a target business or vendor or other entity who has executed an agreement with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account, or (2) as to any claims for indemnification by the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. As a result, if we liquidate, the per-share distribution from the trust account could be less than $10.20 due to claims or potential claims of creditors.





13







We anticipate notifying the trustee of the trust account to begin liquidating such assets promptly after the end of the Combination Period and anticipate it will take no more than 10 business days to effectuate such distribution. The holders of the founder shares have waived their rights to participate in any liquidation distribution from the trust account with respect to such shares. There will be no distribution from the trust account with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless. We will pay the costs of any subsequent liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account.



If we are unable to complete an initial business combination and expend all of the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private shares, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption price would be approximately $10.20. As discussed above, the proceeds deposited in the trust account could become subject to claims of our creditors that are in preference to the claims of public stockholders.



Our public stockholders shall be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only in the event of our failure to complete a business combination within the required time period, if the stockholders seek to have us convert or purchase their respective shares upon a business combination which is actually completed by us or upon certain amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation prior to consummating an initial business combination. In no other circumstances shall a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.



If we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return to our public stockholders at least $10.20 per share.



If we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, because we intend to distribute the proceeds held in the trust account to our public stockholders promptly after the end of the Combination Period, this may be viewed or interpreted as giving preference to our public stockholders over any potential creditors with respect to access to or distributions from our assets. Furthermore, our board may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.



Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation



Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains certain requirements and restrictions relating to our initial public offering that will apply to us until the consummation of our initial business combination. These provisions cannot be amended without the approval of a majority of our stockholders. If we seek to amend any provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that would affect our public stockholders’ ability to convert or sell their shares to us in connection with a business combination as described herein or affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete a business combination by the end of the Combination Period, we will provide dissenting public stockholders with the opportunity to convert their public shares in connection with any such vote. This conversion right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by our sponsor, any executive officer, director or director nominee, or any other person. Our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to waive any conversion rights with respect to any founder shares and any public shares they may hold in connection with any vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. Specifically, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides, among other things, that:

● | we shall either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination or do not vote at all, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), or (2) provide our stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------






14








● | we will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 immediately prior to or upon consummation of such business combination and, if we seek stockholder approval, unless otherwise required by applicable law, regulation or stock exchange rules, a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | if our initial business combination is not consummated by the end of the Combination Period, then we will redeem all of the outstanding public shares and thereafter liquidate and dissolve our company; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | upon the consummation of our initial public offering, approximately $158.1 million, was placed into the trust account; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | we may not consummate any other business combination, merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar transaction prior to our initial business combination; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | prior to our initial business combination, we may not issue additional stock that participates in any manner in the proceeds of the trust account, or that votes as a class with the common stock sold in our initial public offering on an initial business combination. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competition



In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, we have and may continue to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there may be numerous potential target businesses, such as EUR, that we could acquire with the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private shares, our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses may be limited by our available financial resources.



The following also may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses:




● | our obligation to seek stockholder approval of a business combination or engage in a tender offer may delay the completion of a transaction; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our obligation to convert or repurchase shares of common stock held by our public stockholders may reduce the resources available to us for a business combination; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our outstanding warrants, and the potential future dilution they represent. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. Our leadership believes, however, that our status as a public entity and potential access to the United States public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privately held entities having a similar business objective as ours in acquiring a target business with significant growth potential on favorable terms.





15







If we succeed in effecting a business combination, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the target business. We cannot assure you that, subsequent to a business combination, we will have the resources or ability to compete effectively.



Employees



We have two executive officers and one non-executive vice chairman of the board. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters and intend to devote only as much time as they deem necessary to our affairs. The amount of time they will devote in any time period varies based on the stage of the business combination process the company is in. Accordingly, once a suitable target business to acquire has been located, such as EUR, management may spend more time investigating such target business and negotiating and processing the business combination (and consequently spend more time on our affairs) than had been spent prior to locating a suitable target business. We presently expect our executive officers to devote such amount of time as they reasonably believe is necessary to our business. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the consummation of a business combination.
Periodic Reporting and Audited Financial Statements



We have registered our units, common stock and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports, including this Report, contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.



We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of any proxy solicitation materials, such as the EUR Registration Statement, or tender offer documents sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. These financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with or reconciled to GAAP or international financial reporting standards as promulgated by the International Accounting Standards Board. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have the necessary financial statements. To the extent that this requirement cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business.



We are not required to have our internal control procedures audited for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. A target company may also not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.
