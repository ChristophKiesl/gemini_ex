ITEM 1.BUSINESS
Introduction
We are a blank check company incorporated as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (the “initial business combination”). Our Sponsor is DC Rainier SPV LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Sponsor”). While we may pursue an initial business combination target in any industry or geographic region, we intend to focus on established, technology focused businesses that have an aggregate enterprise value of approximately $500 million to $2.0 billion and would benefit from access to public markets and the operational and strategic expertise of our management team and board of directors. We will seek to capitalize on the significant experience of our management team in consummating an initial business combination with the ultimate goal of pursuing attractive returns for our shareholders.
The Registration Statement for our initial public offering was declared effective on October 4, 2021 (the “Initial Public Offering,” or “IPO”). On October 7, 2021, we consummated the Initial Public Offering of 17,250,000 units (the “Units”) at $10.00 per Unit including the full exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option, generating gross proceeds of $172.5 million, and incurring transaction costs of approximately $12.3 million, consisting of $6.9 million of deferred underwriting fees, approximately $1.1 million of other offering costs, and approximately $4.3 million as a cost of the Initial Public Offering in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5A and 5T.
Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we completed the private sale of 596,200 Units (the “Private Placement Units”) at a purchase price of $10.00 per Private Placement Unit (the “Private Placement”), to the Sponsor and our CEO and CFO, generating gross proceeds of approximately $6.0 million.
Approximately $176 million ($10.00 per Unit) of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and certain of the proceeds of the Private Placement was placed in a trust account (the “Trust Account”) located in the United States with American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, and invested only in U.S. “government securities,” within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of one hundred eighty-five (185) days or less, or in money market funds meeting the conditions of paragraphs (d)(1), (d)(2), (d)(3) and (d)(4) of Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act, which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of our initial business combination and (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account as otherwise permitted under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation.
If we are unable to complete an initial business combination within fifteen (15) months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten (10) business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses and net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then-outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.
Our Company
We are a blank check company recently incorporated as a Delaware corporation whose business purpose is to effect a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this prospectus as our initial business combination. To date, our efforts have been limited to organizational activities as well as activities related to the IPO and search for an initial business combination target. Our efforts to identify a prospective target business is not limited to any particular industry or geographic region, although we intend to focus on transactions with companies and assets with a global reach. We have not selected any specific business combination target. Additionally, we have not engaged or retained any agent or other representative to identify or locate any suitable acquisition candidate.
While we may pursue an initial business combination target in any industry or geographic region, we intend to focus on established, technology focused businesses that have an aggregate enterprise value of approximately $500 million to $2.0 billion and 



would benefit from access to public markets and the operational and strategic expertise of our management team and board of directors. We will seek to capitalize on the significant experience of our management team in consummating an initial business combination with the ultimate goal of pursuing attractive returns for our shareholders.
Our Management Team
Our management team is led by Matthew Kearney, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Young Cho, our Chief Financial Officer, who have extensive experience as private equity investors and as C-level executives in a variety of industries including media, financial institutions, and fintech.
Matthew Kearney, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our board of directors, has over 30 years of experience as an investor, Chief Executive Officer, Executive Chairman, and Board member in mergers and acquisitions in the United States and United Kingdom in the areas of private equity, technology and wealth management. Mr. Kearney has previously been an investor and involved in leadership positions of a number of companies including a special purpose acquisition company. Matthew has an MBA from London Business School, a BSc (Hons) in Aeronautical Engineering from Manchester University, and C.Eng. (RAeS).
Young Cho, our Chief Financial Officer and director, has a wide range of experience in the banking and fintech industries. Most recently, Mr. Cho has served in CIO and CFO positions at a select group of early stage cryptocurrency companies. Before getting involved in crypto startups, Mr. Cho held several investment banking positions and was a co-founder and Managing Director at Newtonian Capital, a multi-strategy hedge fund focusing on event-driven strategies based in Hong Kong. Mr. Cho has a BS in Electrical Engineering from Cornell, a Masters in Financial Engineering from Cornell, and a MPA in Economic Policy Management from Columbia.
We believe we will greatly benefit from the experiences of our executive officers and directors as we seek to identify and consummate an initial business combination. Our team has extensive experience in the financial services sector as investors, managers, principals, advisors or directors of companies operating in the technology sector. They also have extensive experience in identifying, negotiating with and conducting due diligence on companies targeted for acquisition and consummating acquisitions in the technology sector. Prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we intend to leverage the industry experience of our executive officers and board, including their extensive contacts, relationships and access to acquisition opportunities. While our management team does have experience pursuing an acquisition on behalf of a blank check company, past performance by our management team is not a guarantee of success with respect to locating a target business to acquire or any business combination we may consummate.
The past performance of the members of our management team or their affiliates is not a guarantee that we will be able to identify a suitable candidate for our initial business combination or of success with respect to any business combination we may consummate. You should not rely on the historical record of the performance of our management team or any of its affiliates’ performance as indicative of our future performance.
If any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us.
Competition
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions.
Many of these entities are well established and have significant experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, the requirement that we acquire a target business or businesses having a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the value of the trust account (excluding any taxes payable) at the time of the agreement to enter into the business combination, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights and the number of our outstanding warrants and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating our initial business combination. 


Employees
We currently have two executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of our initial business combination.
For additional discussion of the general development of our business, see our final prospectus on Form 424B4, filed with the SEC on October 05, 2021.
