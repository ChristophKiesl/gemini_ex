ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Our Company and Business Model
We are a financial services company focused on helping people plan and secure their future by providing technology-enabled and services-oriented solutions to support individuals’ retirement through our annuity products. We currently distribute our annuities through independent distributors who are primarily independent marketing organizations (“IMOs”). Our operations are comprised of four distinct, inter-connected businesses. We seek to reinsure our annuity policies using a reinsurance platform that is attractive to traditional reinsurance entities and other institutional investors seeking above average risk-adjusted returns uncorrelated to the equity markets. To date we have developed relationships with reinsurers who capitalize and manage their own reinsurance capital vehicles utilizing our infrastructure and expertise. Our long-term goal is to build a platform that provides competitive annuity and life insurance products via efficient technology resulting in a seamless customer experience. 
We believe that our operating capabilities and technology platform provides annuity distributors and reinsurers with flexible and cost-effective solutions. We seek to create value through our ability to provide the distributors and reinsurers with annuity product innovation, speed to market for new products, competitive rates and commissions, and streamlined customer and agent experiences. Our capital model allows us to support increasing annuity sales volumes with capital capacity provided by reinsurers.

We provide an end-to-end solution to manage annuity products that includes a broad set of product development, distribution support, policy administration, and asset/liability management services. Our technology platform enables us to efficiently develop, sell and administer a wide range of products. Our asset management services are also provided to third-party insurers and reinsurers. 
We currently offer annuity products, consisting of multi-year guaranteed annuity (“MYGA”) and fixed indexed annuity (“FIA”) policies, through IMOs that in turn distribute our products and services to independent insurance agents in 22 states and the District of Columbia. We further provide IMOs with our product development expertise, administrative capabilities and technology platform. 
We seek to reinsure substantially all of our annuity policies with third-party reinsurers and our captive reinsurance subsidiary, Seneca Reinsurance Company, LLC (“Seneca Re”). Our third-party reinsurers include traditional reinsurers and capital markets reinsurers, which are third-party investors seeking Our third-party reinsurers include traditional reinsurers and capital markets reinsurers, who are seeking exposure to reinsurance revenue and typically do not have their own reinsurance platforms or insurance related operations. 
We were formed in 2003 as a financial services company and began our insurance operations in 2009. Following a change in control transaction in 2018, we began implementing our current business model and strategic plan. In December 2020, our voting common stock was listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbol MDWT.
We operate our core business through four subsidiaries under one reportable segment. American Life & Security Corp. (“American Life”) is a Nebraska-domiciled life insurance company, that is also commercially domiciled in Texas and is currently licensed to sell, underwrite, and market life insurance and annuity products in 22 states and the District of Columbia. American Life obtained a financial strength rating of B++ (“Good”) from A.M. Best Company (“A.M. Best”), a leading rating agency for insurance companies, in December 2018 that was affirmed in December 2020 and February 2022. A.M. Best also upgraded American Life’s long-term issuer credit rating to bbb+ from bbb in December 2020 and affirmed in February 2022. All of our annuities are written by American Life.
Our other insurance subsidiary, Seneca Re, is a Vermont-domiciled sponsored captive reinsurance company established in early 2020 to reinsure various types of risks on behalf of American Life and third-party capital providers through special purpose reinsurance entities known as “protected cells.” Through Seneca Re, we assist capital market investors in establishing and licensing new protected cells. 1505 Capital LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“1505 Capital”), is an SEC registered investment adviser that provides financial, investment advisory, and management services. 
We seek to deliver long-term value by growing our annuity volumes and generating profitable fee-based revenue. We generate fees and other revenue based on the gross deposits received on the annuity policies we issue, reinsure, and administer. 
By reinsuring a significant portion of the annuity policies we issue, the level of capital needed for American Life is significantly less than retaining all of the business on its books. We believe this “capital light” approach has the potential to produce enhanced returns for our business compared to a traditional insurance company capital structure. This strategy helps alleviate our insurance regulatory capital requirements because policies that are reinsured require substantially less capital and surplus than policies retained by us. We also have the flexibility to selectively retain assets and liabilities associated with our policies for a period of time when we expect that doing so will provide an attractive return on our capital.
As of December 31, 2021, approximately 50% of the deposits received, in the current year, relating to our annuity products were ceded to reinsurance vehicles capitalized by third party reinsurers or held in protected cells within Seneca Re for future reinsurance transactions. 
For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we generated $30.1 million and $10.6 million of revenue from investment income, realized gains on investments, ceding commissions earned, policy administration, and asset management fees. 
In 2018, we launched our business plan to become a capital efficient, technology-enabled, and service-oriented solutions provider to the annuity and life markets. We provide insurance distributors and reinsurers with an end-to-end solution to develop, issue and administer annuity products. 
We utilize our insurance and ancillary services businesses to develop and issue annuities through IMOs. We generally seek to reinsure substantially all of the financial risk associated with our policies to third-party reinsurers, including traditional and capital markets

reinsurers, and Seneca Re. We also have the flexibility to selectively retain assets and liabilities associated with our policies for a period of time when we expect that doing so will provide an attractive return on our capital. 
Through our ancillary services businesses we administer the policies we issue and offer asset management services to our reinsurance partners for a fee. Through Seneca Re, we also assist capital market investors in establishing and licensing new special purpose reinsurance entities. We believe our broad service offering provides a growing and valuable fee stream, and expect that our policy administration and asset management fee income will increase as we grow our number of administered policies and the associated assets that we manage. In the future, we expect to have opportunities to increase our policy administration and asset management revenue by providing these services on a stand-alone basis to new customers. 
We seek to create value for our distribution and reinsurance partners by facilitating product innovation, rapid speed to market for new products, competitively-priced products, streamlined customer and agent experience, and efficient technology-enabled operations. We generate fee income from reinsurers in the form of ceding commissions, policy administration fees, and asset management fees. We typically receive upfront ceding commissions and expense reimbursements at the time the policies are reinsured and policy administration fees over the policy lifetimes. We also earn asset management fees on the assets we hold that support the obligations of many of our reinsurers. 
Our reinsurance strategy helps alleviate our insurance regulatory capital requirements because policies that are reinsured require substantially less capital and surplus than policies retained by us. In investing on behalf of our insurance and reinsurance company subsidiaries, we seek to maximize yield by constructing portfolios that include a diversified portfolio of bonds, mortgages, private credit and structured securities, including collateralized loan obligations while minimizing the difference in duration between our investment assets and liabilities.
Our Products
Through American Life we presently issue several MYGA and FIA products. American Life presently offers five annuity products, two MYGAs, a FIA, and two bonus plans associated with the FIA product. It is not presently offering any traditional life insurance products. Fixed annuities are a type of insurance contract in which the policyholder makes one or more premium deposits, earning interest at a crediting rate determined in relation to a specific market index, on a tax deferred basis. MYGAs are insurance contracts under which the policyholder makes deposits and earns a crediting rate guaranteed for a specified number of years before it may be changed. American Life’s MYGA products are three and five-year single premium deferred individual annuity contracts, providing consumers with an attractive, low risk, predictable and tax-deferred investment option. American Life’s FIA products are long-term (7 and 10-year) annuity products with interest rates that are tied, in part, to published stock market indices chosen by customers. The FIA products are modified single premium annuity contracts designed for individuals seeking to benefit from potential market gains with fully protected principal. American Life began selling its MYGA and FIA products in 2019. 
We introduced two new indexes into the selections on FIA products. The S&P 500 ESG index for fixed annuities, comprised of a subset S&P 500 companies built to meet the increasing needs of investors seeking socially responsible investments aligned with a mainstream index which is published by one of the foremost index authorities in the world, S&P Dow Jones Indices (S&P DJI).
The Goldman Sachs Xenith Index is a multi-asset strategy that uses the anticipated macro regime, as identified by a leading economic indicator, to make asset allocations. By using a leading economic indicator, the Goldman Sachs Xenith Index differs from indices that rely on a backward-looking methodology alone. Instead of relying purely on the S&P 500 Index for exposure to U.S. equities, the index employs an intraday overlay that can reduce equity exposure based on intra-day trading "signals". As a result, the strategy incorporates real-time market movements, in addition to other factors, in its rules-based methodology. 
We expect to expand American Life’s product line in the future and we recently introduced two index FIAs, the “S&P 500 ESG Index” and the “Goldman Sachs Xenith Index.” Depending on market demand, we expect to consider having American Life write a wide variety of insurance products, including fixed deferred, fixed indexed and other annuities. Any new insurance products we create must be filed with and approved by appropriate state insurance regulatory authorities before being offered to the public. American Life’s MYGA and FIA products were developed using an independent consulting actuary, and we expect that any new products will utilize similar services. Our long-term plan is to broaden our products to life and Medicare supplements under attractive market conditions.

Under Statutory Accounting Principles, the MYGA and FIA premiums are treated as premiums written and as revenue when earned.

Our Ancillary Services 
Policy Administration 
We provide a cloud-based policy administration solution called “m.pas,” which operates as a division of American Life. We built m.pas to provide a scalable policy administration solution for annuity products. Its policy administration platform is a flexible solution designed to aggregate and manage structured and unstructured data, and provide operational efficiencies that lead to lower policy administration costs relative to traditional insurance carriers. This technology-enabled solution also provides relatively shortened new product launch capabilities and our platform facilitates integration of asset/liability management into traditional asset portfolio risk systems. We are under contract with most of our reinsurers to administer all policies ceded under our various reinsurance agreements. We believe this solution creates an opportunity to expand these services into a broader business as a third-party administrator (“TPA”) for other insurers. 
Asset Management 
1505 Capital provides asset-liability management services to American Life, third-party reinsurers and third-party insurance clients. 1505 Capital provides its expertise, and infrastructure to develop and implement customized solutions for clients seeking to optimize risk-adjusted portfolio yields, liquidity, maturity profile, risk and capital monitoring, and asset-liability management. 1505 Capital also focuses on originating and managing commercial mortgages, private credit, and structured products. We generally require reinsurers to secure their obligations to American Life in the form of assets deposited on American Life’s balance sheet or via assets held in trust to provide security for potential claims. Reinsurers may appoint 1505 Capital to manage these assets pursuant to guidelines adopted by us that are consistent with state investment statutes and reinsurance regulations. At December 31, 2021, 1505 Capital had approximately $405 million total third-party reinsurer assets under management.
Our Partners 
Distributors 
We currently have selling agreements with eight IMOs that contract with numerous independent agents to sell our annuity policies. The IMOs recruit, train and support independent agents who sell annuities, life insurance and other financial products to consumers. Although we contract with the IMOs, we also have contracts with each agent. We require agents who distribute our policies to complete our product and compliance training in anti-money laundering, annuity products and annuity suitability, and the annuity products we offer. As of December 31, 2021, we had 1,686 active agents under contract. 
We support our distribution partners by enabling them to introduce additional products, meet the needs of independent agents and consumers, implement flexible policy designs and bring new products to market quickly. Our technology capabilities allow for flexible product design with speed to market to meet the needs of independent agents and consumers. We believe that if we are able to achieve 

8



an upgrade of American Life’s A.M. Best rating to A-, it would increase the demand for our annuities, and would attract additional distribution and reinsurance partners, including small to mid-sized banks and broker-dealers. 
Reinsurance. 
As indicated above, reinsurance is an integral part of our business plan. We market, underwrite and issue annuity products through American Life and seek to reinsure the policies with third-party reinsurers and Seneca Re. We partner with traditional third-party reinsurers and reinsurers sponsored by capital markets investors, including asset managers and institutional investors. We believe this strategy helps us preserve our capital while supporting sales growth because we have lower capital requirements when the policy liabilities are reinsured than when we retain all of the policy liabilities. 
In some cases, we will retain our policies for a period of time in our captive reinsurance company in order to create block reinsurance transactions. We expect that our ability to accumulate and reinsure larger portfolios of policies over time should increase the size and number of reinsurers who seek to reinsure our liabilities. 
Seneca Re was formed to operate as a sponsored captive insurance company for the purpose of reinsuring insurance policies through protected cells, under Vermont insurance regulations. Seneca Re provides an efficient structure for capital markets investors to reinsure our policies through protected cells that we manage. As of December 31, 2021, through Seneca Re and American Life we had five reinsurance agreements with third parties and a reinsurance agreement with an affiliate of Crestline Assurance Holdings LLC, discussed below.
Our Technology 
Our business model utilizes a modern, end-to-end, cloud-based technology platform that we began implementing in 2018. This platform enables us to develop, sell and administer a broad range of competitive annuity products. We license key components of our technology from third-party software providers, including product development, new business, distribution management and policy administration applications. We believe this strategy allows us to provide high quality technology capabilities with limited capital investment and increased flexibility. In addition, we have added several core technology integrations to optimize the speed and efficiency of our interactions with IMOs, their agents and policyholders, including document management, electronic application capability, secure log-ins, and an agent and policyholder portal. We believe our technology platform provides cost effective product development, sales and administration that enables us to control the growth of our operating and other expenses while expanding our operations and growing our sales volume. 
Our Market Opportunity 
We participate in a large U.S. market that we expect to grow in part due to a number of demographic trends. As measured by annual premiums written, annuities are the largest product line in the life, annuity, and accident and health sector. Annuities play an important role in retirement planning by providing individuals with stable, tax-efficient sources of income. In 2020 annuity premiums, accounted for $295 billion of annual premiums, or approximately 31% of the $963 billion of total annual life, annuity, and accident and health premiums according to Insurance Information Institute. The most common annuities are fixed and variable and can be written on an individual or group basis. Our current products are FIA’s written on an individual basis. 
An increasing portion of the U.S. population is of retirement age and is expected to increase the retirement income needs of retirees. The number of people of retirement age has increased significantly since 2010, driven by the aging of the “Baby Boomer” generation. The U.S. population over 65 years old is forecast to grow from 56 million in 2020 to an estimated 81 million in the next 20 years, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, Population Estimates and Projections. This study also forecasted that U.S. population aged over 65 years old is expected to grow by 44% from 2020 to 2040, while the total U.S. population is expected to grow by only 12%.

Annuities in the U.S. are distributed through a number of channels, most of which are independent from the insurance companies that issue annuities. Independent distribution channels serve as the primary and a growing source of annuity distribution. In 2020, approximately 77% of U.S. individual annuity sales occurred through independent distributors, including independent agents, broker-dealers, and banks, representing an increase from approximately 70% in 2016 according to U.S. Individual Annuities, 2020 Year in Review, Life Insurance Marketing and Research Association (“LIMRA”), 2021. Independent agents are the second largest distribution channel, behind independent broker-dealers, accounting for approximately 19% of U.S. individual annuity sales in 2020. IMOs provide independent agents with access to annuity products along with operational support services and functionality to support the distribution services of the agents. The infrastructure and support services provided by IMOs to independent agents are critical to the success of independent agents and their ability to serve their customers and generate additional sales. 
We believe that capital markets investors have been actively seeking investing in and acquiring insurance and reinsurance companies in recent years. Fixed annuities provide upfront premiums and stable, long-term payment obligations and are thus attractive sources of liability-funded assets for a variety of traditional and alternative asset managers and investors. However, there are significant regulatory and operational hurdles for capital providers looking to enter the insurance market. These hurdles are exacerbated by the limited legacy administrative capabilities, product development processes and technology systems, of traditional insurers and reinsurers. We provide asset managers and investors the ability to seamlessly access funding from annuities through a variety of reinsurance entities that we can form quickly and operate efficiently with lower upfront and ongoing regulatory and operating costs.
We operate in highly competitive markets with a variety of participants, including insurance companies, financial institutions, asset managers, and reinsurance companies. These companies compete in various forms in the annuity market, for investment assets and for services. We seek to build strong relationships along with offering technology-enabled and services-oriented solutions for our partners.
Our Competitive Strengths 
Differentiated Value Proposition 
We provide annuity product development and asset management services, enhanced by American Life’s A.M. Best financial strength rating and licenses to sell annuity products in 22 states and the District of Columbia. We have developed and implemented a technology platform and administrative services that we believe provides us with the opportunity to expand our revenue opportunities, lower our operating costs on a per policy basis and increase customer value for our distribution partners. We believe our business model and multi-service capabilities provide our reinsurance and capital provider participants with attractive capital deployment opportunities.
We also believe our ongoing strategy to have American Life become licensed to sell insurance in additional states and seek a higher A.M. Best rating will further strengthen our value. 
Multiple Revenue Sources 
Our business model generates upfront ceding commissions and fee-based revenue from recurring policy administration and asset management fees. We receive ceding commissions and expense reimbursement from reinsurers at the time we cede our primary insurance liabilities to them, providing meaningful cash flow. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we generated $11.2 and $10.6 million, respectively, in upfront ceding commissions. On our balance sheet is an item “deferred gains on reinsurance” equaling $28.5 million and $18.2 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively which will be earned as revenue over the contract periods. Amortization of the deferred gain on reinsurance was $3.0 million and $1.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively, and was recognized as revenue under GAAP. We also receive policy administration fees on annuities that we issue and manage, and we receive asset management fees from most of our third-party reinsurers relating to assets they deposit as collateral to cover claims on the policies they reinsure. These fees are typically received over the life of our annuity products, usually over five to ten years, thereby providing a stable revenue stream. 
Capital Structure 
Our business model utilizes our insurance and reinsurance industry participants to transfer assets and liabilities associated with our issued annuities to third-party capital providers and Seneca Re via reinsurance agreements. This strategy reduces our regulatory capital and surplus requirements because policies that are reinsured require less capital and surplus reserves than policies retained by us, allowing us to grow our business without significant capital constraints.

Effective Use of Technology 
We believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on the accelerating trend of digital transformation across the insurance industry. We believe our modern, fully functional technology platform provides us a significant opportunity to penetrate large addressable markets with our compressed product development cycles. 
Scalable, Low-Cost Operations 
We focus on investing in technology enhanced processes that improve the efficiency and effectiveness of developing, distributing, issuing and managing our annuity products. We believe our model allows us to develop attractively priced products that are desirable for our IMOs to market. We currently operate on a small scale in a large addressable market. Going forward, our technology platform and streamlined processes should enable us to be scalable and allow us to produce incremental premium volumes without significant additional investment in infrastructure and with low incremental fixed operating costs. 
Lower-Risk, Business Model 
We believe our business model enables us to operate with reduced risk because we reinsure a substantial portion of our business. While we would have to pay policy claims in the event of non-payment of them by any of our reinsurers, we often obtain collateral from reinsurers to provide for policy claims or use reinsurers who have creditworthy ratings. Further, we have designed American Life’s MYGA and FIA products to have fixed, predictable costs with low volatility and surrender charges that discourage redemptions prior to maturity and contain features to reward persistency. 
We generate revenue through the ceding commissions and other fee income we receive from our reinsurance providers and the ancillary services we provide. Also, we incur minimal direct expenses associated with the ceding commissions we generate, and we incur low incremental expenses on additional policy volumes we produce. As a result, we believe we will be able to achieve profitable incremental fee-based revenue from additional premium volume. Because we have a fully integrated technology platform, we also expect that we will be able to increase our operating margins as we continue to scale our business.
Entrepreneurial, Highly Experienced and Aligned Management Team 
Our highly experienced, entrepreneurial senior management team has extensive experience in insurance, technology, and investment management. Georgette Nicholas, our Chief Executive Officer has more than 30 years’ experience in the global financial services industry including insurance reinsurance and capital markets. She has a commitment to developing strong culture and leadership in organizations, supporting diversity and inclusion to grow engagement. Ms. Nicholas previously held the position of CEO and Managing Director for Genworth Mortgage Insurance Australia, a publicly listed Australian Securities Exchange Ltd company in Sydney, Australia. She also held various roles with Genworth Financial, Inc. in investor relations, chief financial officer roles in the mortgage insurance business and controllership. Ms. Nicholas also worked in public accounting, including as a firm director with Deloitte.
Michael Minnich, our President, has over 25 years of experience in asset management, insurance company management, technology and risk management. Prior to joining Midwest, Mr. Minnich served as managing member of Rendezvous Capital LLC, a New York firm advising insurers on capital and investments. Previously, he was a Managing Director at Swiss Re, where he managed a multibillion-dollar investment portfolio. 
Our Growth Strategy 
Expand Market Presence 
We believe that our current product offerings should enable us to achieve policy sales growth as we increase the number of states in which we become licensed to sell insurance. Many of our IMOs distribute to insurance agents throughout the United States, and we expect they will increase their sales volume as American Life enters new states. 

The 22 states and District of Columbia in which we currently operate represented over $113 billion in total annuity premiums during 2021. By comparison, we generated $417.6 million of total annuity premiums under SAP for the year ended December 31, 2021. 

11



Develop Additional Distribution and Reinsurance Relationships 
We currently distribute annuity products through eight third-party IMOs. We believe our product development, prompt policy processing, operating flexibility and speed to market make us a desirable partner for insurance distributors. We will seek to grow by increasing volumes with our current IMOs and by establishing new IMO relationships. 
We are seeking to leverage the relationships we have with reinsurers, capital markets investors and reinsurance intermediaries to develop additional reinsurance relationships. In addition, as indicated above we established Seneca Re in early 2020 to operate as a sponsored captive insurance company for the purpose of insuring and reinsuring various types of insurance risks for American Life and various and third-party capital providers through protected cells. Also, in early 2020, we developed a strategic relationship with Crestline Assurance Holdings LLC and its affiliates discussed below to provide reinsurance capital and access to quality assets with attractive risk-adjusted returns. 
Exploit Established Corporate Platform 
We believe that we have the leadership and corporate culture, industry relationships, infrastructure and technology to achieve growth and improve operating margins with increased annuity sales. We believe we have an efficient corporate platform to support increased sales volumes, an expansion of our distribution relationships and the development of new annuity products without significant additional incremental costs. 
Revenue from Policy Administration and Asset Management Services 
In addition to the ceding commissions we receive through our reinsurance strategy, we generate recurring fee income for providing policy administration and asset management services to third-party reinsurers. We are contracted to administer all of our policies ceded under various reinsurance agreements. We also provide asset management services for most of our third-party reinsurers. We believe these complementary services provide a differentiated solution to third-party reinsurers that should assist us in developing additional reinsurer relationships.
Continue to Invest in Technology Capabilities 
Our business strategy is centered upon our commitment to apply technology to improve and expand our business. We have developed a modern technology platform with a combination of proprietary and third-party systems that enables us to efficiently develop, sell and administer a broad range of annuity products. We expect to continue to develop our technology platform to expand the technology-enabled capabilities we offer to distributors and reinsurers.
History 
We are a financial services holding company that was originally incorporated in Nebraska in October 2003. In September 2009, American Life was issued a certificate of authority to conduct life insurance business in Nebraska. In June 2018, we underwent a change in control as a result of the closing of a Loan, Convertible Preferred Stock and Convertible Senior Secured Note Purchase Agreement (the “Xenith Agreement”) with a then non-affiliated third-party, Xenith Holdings LLC (“Xenith”). Xenith was a wholly controlled subsidiary of Vespoint LLC (“Vespoint”), which was also the manager of Xenith. Pursuant to the Xenith Agreement, we issued Series C Preferred Stock and convertible senior secured notes to Xenith between June and December 2018. Of the funds received from Xenith, we contributed $20.5 million to American Life through capital contributions. Following the closing of the Xenith Agreement, we embarked on implementing our current business plan. 
In June 2019, the Xenith Series C Preferred Stock and convertible senior secured notes were converted into 145,709 shares and 1,855,361 shares of our voting common stock, respectively. In August 2020, Xenith distributed all of its shares of our voting common stock to its members, including Vespoint. On November 10, 2020, Vespoint distributed all of its shares of our voting common stock to its members. 
In August 2020, we effected a 500 for one reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding shares of voting common stock, and we reincorporated in Delaware. 

12



On December 17, 2020, our voting common stock was listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “MDWT.” On December 21, 2020, we completed a public offering of 1,000,000 shares of our voting common stock at a price to the public of $70.00 per share. The aggregate net proceeds of the offering were approximately $65.1 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions.
​
On November 10, 2021, Midwest purchased 1,000 shares of Common Stock, $.01 par value per share for a total purchase price of $5.7 million for 100% ownership in an intermediary holding company Midwest Capital Corporation. Also, on November 10, 2021, Seneca Re Protected Cell 2021-03 (“SRC3”) was granted a Certificate of Authority by the Vermont Department of Financial Regulation. The intermediary holding company contributed capital of $5.5 million to purchase 100% of SRC3 Class A and B capital stock. Also, on November 10, 2021, American Life and SRC3 entered into a Funds Withheld and Modified Coinsurance Agreement, whereby, SRC3 agreed to provide reinsurance funding for a quota share percentage of 45% of the liabilities of American Life arising from its MYGA and quota share percentage of 45% of American Life’s FIA products.
​
As discussed above, Midwest owned 100% in SRC1 by contributing a total of $21.4 million. On December 30, 2021, Midwest closed the sale of approximately 70% of Seneca Incorporate Cell, LLC 2020-01 (“SRC1”) to a subsidiary of ORIX Corporation USA “ORIX USA”) for $15.0 million. Under the terms of the agreement, Midwest holds a 30% ownership interest in SRC1. ORIX Advisers, LLC, another subsidiary of ORIX USA, will be the manager of the assets underlying SRC1’s reinsurance obligations going forward, replacing Midwest’s asset management arm, 1505 Capital LLC.
​
Crestline Relationship 
On April 24, 2020, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with Crestline Assurance Holdings LLC (“Crestline”) an institutional alternative investment management firm under which we issued 444,444 shares of our voting common stock to Crestline for aggregate proceeds of $10.0 million. Also, on April 24, 2020, we issued 231,655 shares of our voting common stock to various other investors in separate transactions for approximately $5.3 million. We contributed $5.0 million of the net proceeds to American Life and used $3.3 million of the proceeds to capitalize Seneca Re and its first protected cell. We also entered into a Stockholders Agreement along with Xenith and Vespoint that grants Crestline certain rights. Also, Douglas K. Bratton, a principal of Crestline, was appointed as a director of both our board of directors and the American Life board of directors. 
In addition, on April 24, 2020, American Life entered into a three-year master letter agreement and related reinsurance, trust and asset management agreement with Seneca Re and a Crestline affiliate regarding the flow of annuity reinsurance and related asset management, whereby Crestline agreed to provide reinsurance funding for a quota share percentage of 25% of the liabilities of American Life arising from its MYGA and quota share percentage of 40% of American Life’s FIA products. The Crestline affiliate contributed $40.0 million of assets to capitalize SRC2 now known as Crestline Re SP1 (“Crestline SP1”). Through December 31, 2021, American Life had ceded $227.2 million face amount of annuities to Crestline SP1. American Life received total ceding commissions of $12.9 million and expense reimbursements of $24.1 million in connection with these transactions for the year ended December 31, 2021. Effective December 8, 2020, American Life entered into a novation agreement with SRC2 and Crestline Re SPC, an exempted segregated portfolio company incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands, for and on behalf of Crestline SP1, a segregated portfolio company of Crestline Re SPC, under which the above described reinsurance, trust and related asset management agreements were novated and replaced with substantially similar agreements entered into by American Life and Crestline SP1.
Employees 
As of December 31, 2021, we had 64 full time employees. Our headquarters is in Lincoln, Nebraska and has an office in New York. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
We are committed to creating an environment of diversity, equity and inclusion as part of our foundational values. Recruiting, developing and retaining talent is a key to succeeding in growing our business. 
Regulation 
General 
Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation and supervision by the states in which they are domiciled, particularly with respect to their financial condition. American Life is domiciled in Nebraska and commercially domiciled in Texas, where it is

regulated and supervised by the NDOI and the Texas Department of Insurance, respectively. Seneca Re is domiciled in Vermont where it is regulated and supervised by the Vermont Department of Financial Regulation. Our insurance subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by all states in which they transact business, which oversight in practice often focuses on review of their market conduct. American Life is licensed to conduct insurance business and is therefore subject to regulation and supervision by insurance regulators, in 22 states and the District of Columbia. Seneca Re, a Vermont limited liability company, was formed by Midwest to operate as a sponsored captive insurance company for the purpose of reinsuring various types of risks of its participants through one or more special purpose reinsurance or “protected cell” entities and to conduct any other business that is permitted for sponsored captive insurance companies under Vermont insurance regulations. The extent and scope of insurance regulation varies between jurisdictions, but most jurisdictions have laws and regulations governing the financial security of insurers, including admittance of assets for purposes of calculating statutory surplus, standards of solvency, reserves, reinsurance, capital adequacy and the business conduct of insurers. 
In addition, statutes and regulations require the licensing of insurers and their agents, the approval of policy forms and related materials and the approval of rates. State statutes and regulations also prescribe the permitted types and concentrations of investments by insurers. The primary purpose of this insurance industry regulation is to protect policyholders. Life insurance companies are required to file detailed quarterly and annual financial statements with insurance regulatory authorities in each of the jurisdictions in which they are licensed to do business, and their operations are subject to periodic examination by such authorities. Regulators have discretionary authority, in connection with the continued licensing of insurance companies, to limit or prohibit the ability to continue to do business policies if, in their judgment, the regulators determine that an insurer is not maintaining necessary statutory surplus or capital or if the further transaction of business will be detrimental to its policyholders.
The amount of dividends that our insurance subsidiaries may pay in any twelve-month period, without prior approval by their respective domestic insurance regulators, is restricted under the laws of Nebraska, Texas and Vermont. 
Under Nebraska law, dividends payable from American Life during any twelve-month period without the prior approval of the state’s Insurance Director are limited to the greater of 10% of American Life’s surplus as shown on the immediately preceding calendar year’s statutory financial statement on file with the NDOI or 100% of net gain from operations for the prior calendar year. Any dividend in excess of such limitation must be approved by the Insurance Director.
Insurance holding company regulation 
We are an insurance holding company and, together with our insurance subsidiaries and our other subsidiaries and affiliates, are subject to the insurance holding company system laws of Nebraska, Texas and Vermont. These laws vary across jurisdictions, but generally require insurers that are members of such insurance holding company’s system to register with the jurisdiction’s insurance regulatory authorities, to file reports disclosing certain information, including their capital structure, ownership, management, financial condition, enterprise risk and own risk and solvency assessment. 
These laws also require disclosure of certain qualifying transactions between or among our insurance subsidiaries and us or any of our other subsidiaries or affiliates to which one or more of our insurance subsidiaries is a party. Such transactions could include loans, investments, sales, service agreements and reinsurance agreements among other similar inter-affiliate transactions. These laws also require that intercompany transactions be fair and reasonable and not adversely affect the interests of policyholders. In certain circumstances, the insurance company must give prior notice of the transaction to the insurance department in its state of domicile, and the insurance department must either approve or disapprove the subject intercompany transaction within defined periods. Further, these laws require that an insurer’s surplus following any dividends or distributions to shareholder affiliates is reasonable in relation to the insurer’s outstanding liabilities and its financial needs. 

14



The insurance holding company laws in some states, including Nebraska, Texas and Vermont, require regulatory approval of a direct or indirect change of control of an insurer or an insurer’s parent company. Generally, to obtain approval from the insurance commissioner for any acquisition of control of an insurance company or its parent company, the proposed acquirer must file with the applicable commissioner an application containing information regarding: (i) the identity and background of the acquirer and its affiliates; (ii) the nature, source and amount of funds to be used to carry out the acquisition; (iii) the financial statements of the acquirer and its affiliates; (iv) any potential plans for disposition of the securities or business of the insurer; (v) the number and type of securities to be acquired; (vi) any contracts with respect to the securities to be acquired; (vii) any agreements with broker-dealers; and (viii) other relevant matters. Different jurisdictions may have similar or additional requirements for prior approval of any acquisition of control of an insurance or reinsurance company licensed or authorized to transact business in those jurisdictions. Additional requirements may include re-licensing or subsequent approval for renewal of existing licenses upon an acquisition of control.
Credit for reinsurance 
State insurance laws permit U.S. insurance companies, as ceding insurers, to take financial statement credit for reinsurance that is ceded, so long as the assuming reinsurer satisfies the state’s credit for reinsurance laws. Credit for reinsurance means the ceding company is permitted to reflect in its statutory financial statements a credit in an amount equal to the ceding company’s liability that is reinsured. In general, credit for reinsurance is allowed if the reinsurer is licensed or “accredited” in the state in which the ceding insurer is domiciled; or if neither of the above applies, to the extent that the reinsurance obligations of the reinsurer are collateralized appropriately, typically through the posting of a letter of credit for the benefit of the ceding insurer, or the deposit of assets into a trust fund established for the benefit of the ceding insurer.
​
Statutory examinations 
Our insurance subsidiaries are required to file detailed quarterly and annual financial statements, in accordance with SAP with regulatory officials in each of the jurisdictions in which they conduct business. As part of their routine regulatory oversight process, the NDOI, the Texas Department of Insurance and the Vermont Insurance Department conduct periodic detailed examinations, generally once every three to five years of the books, records, accounts and operations of our insurance subsidiaries domiciled in their states. The State of Nebraska began a scheduled examination of American Life for the period of 2017-2019 in January 2021. On September 30, 2021, the NDOI completed their examination for American Life through 2019 and issued the final report.
Financial tests 
The NAIC has developed a set of financial relationships or “tests,” known as the Insurance Regulatory Information System or IRIS, which is designed for early identification of companies that may require special attention or action by insurance regulatory authorities. Insurance companies submit data annually to the NAIC, which in turn analyzes the data by utilizing ratios. State insurance regulators review this statistical report, which is available to the public, together with an analytical report, prepared by and available only to state insurance regulators, to identify insurance companies that appear to require immediate regulatory attention. A “usual range” of results for each ratio is used as a benchmark. 
Risk-based capital requirements 
In order to enhance the regulation of insurers’ solvency, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“ NAIC”) adopted a model law to implement Risk Based Capital (“RBC”) requirements for life insurers. All states have adopted the NAIC’s model law or a substantively similar law. The NAIC Risk-Based Capital Model Act requires insurance companies to submit an annual RBC Report, which compares an insurer’s total adjusted capital with its authorized control level RBC. A company’s RBC is calculated by using a specified formula that applies factors to various specified assets, premium, claim, expense and reserve items. The factors are higher for those items with greater underlying risk and lower for items with less underlying risk. 
The RBC Report is used by insurance regulators to set in motion appropriate regulatory actions relating to insurers that show indications of weak or deteriorating conditions. RBC is an additional standard for minimum capital requirements that insurers must meet to avoid being placed in receivership by regulators. The annual RBC Report, and the information contained therein, is not intended by the NAIC as a means to rank insurers.

RBC is a method of measuring the minimum amount of capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations in light of its size and risk profile. It provides a means of setting the capital requirement in which the degree of risk taken by the insurer is the primary determinant. The value of an insurer’s Total Adjusted Capital, which is the sum of its year-end statutory capital and surplus, in relation to its RBC, together with its trend in its Total Adjusted Capital, is used as a basis for determining regulatory action that a state insurance regulator may be authorized or required to take with respect to an insurer. 
Market Conduct Exams 
Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to periodic market conduct exams (“MCE”) in any jurisdiction where they do business. A MCE typically entails review of business activities, such as operations and management, complaint handling, marketing and sales, producer licensing, policyholder service, underwriting, and claims handling. Regulators may impose fines and penalties upon finding violations of regulations governing such business activities. To date, neither American Life nor Seneca Re have been the subject of such market conduct exam.
Form approvals 
Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to state laws and regulations regarding form approvals. In most states, insurance policies are subject to prior regulatory approval in the state in which the policy is sold. 
Unfair claims practices 
Insurance companies are prohibited by state statutes from engaging in unfair claims practice. Unfair claims practices include, but are not limited to, misrepresenting pertinent facts or insurance policy provisions; failing to acknowledge and act reasonably promptly upon communications with respect to claims arising under insurance policies; and attempting to settle a claim for less than the amount to which a reasonable person would have believed such person was entitled. 
Assessments against insurers 
Under the insurance guaranty fund laws, which exist in each state and the District of Columbia, licensed insurers can be assessed by insurance guaranty associations for certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants. Most of these laws provide for annual limits on the assessments and for an offset against state premium taxes. These premium tax offsets must be spread over future periods ranging from five to 20 years. Since these assessments typically are not made for several years after an insurer fails and depend upon the final outcome of liquidation or rehabilitation proceedings, we cannot accurately determine the amount or timing of any future assessments. 
Regulation of investments 
Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to state laws that restrict the kinds of investments they can make. These laws require diversification of our investment portfolios and limit the amounts of investments in certain asset categories, such as below-investment grade fixed income securities, equity real estate, other equity investments and derivatives. Failure to comply with these requirements and limitations cause affected investments to be treated as non-admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus and, in some instances, could require the divestiture of such nonqualifying investments. American Life’s investment guidelines, including its Derivative Use Plan, have been filed with the Nebraska Department of Insurance.
Statutory accounting practices 
SAP are a basis of accounting developed to assist insurance regulators in monitoring and regulating the solvency of insurance companies. SAP is primarily concerned with measuring an insurer’s solvency. Statutory accounting focuses on valuing assets and liabilities of insurers at financial reporting dates in accordance with appropriate insurance law and regulatory provisions applicable in each insurer’s domiciliary state. 

16



GAAP is concerned with a company’s solvency, but is also concerned with other financial measurements, principally income and cash flows. Accordingly, GAAP gives more consideration to appropriately matching revenue and expenses and accounting for management’s stewardship of assets than does SAP. As a direct result, different assets and liabilities and different amounts of assets and liabilities will be reflected in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP as compared to SAP.
Unfair trade practices 
State insurance laws prohibit insurers from engaging in unfair trade practices. The kinds of practices addressed are (i) misrepresentation and false advertising, (ii) unfair discrimination in premiums and policy benefits, (iii) boycott, coercion and intimidation, (iv) discrimination based on race, color, creed or national origin, sex or marital status, and (v) rebating of premium. 
Enterprise risk and other developments 
The NAIC, as part of its solvency modernization initiative, has engaged in a concerted effort to strengthen the ability of U.S. state insurance regulators to monitor U.S. insurance holding company groups. The holding company reform efforts at the NAIC culminated in December 2010 in the adoption of significant amendments to the NAIC’s Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act (the “Model Holding Company Act”) and its Insurance Holding Company System Model Regulation (the “Model Holding Company Regulation”). Among other things, the revised Model Holding Company Act and Model Holding Company Regulation explicitly address “enterprise” risk — the risk that an activity, circumstance, event or series of events involving one or more affiliates of an insurer will, if not remedied promptly, be likely to have a material adverse effect upon the financial condition or liquidity of the insurer or its insurance holding company system as a whole - and require annual reporting of potential enterprise risk as well as access to information to allow the state insurance regulator to assess such risk. In addition, the Model Holding Company Act amendments include a requirement to the effect that any person divesting control over an insurer must provide 30 days’ notice to the regulator and the insurer (with an exception for cases where a Form A is being filed). The amendments direct the domestic state insurance regulator to determine those instances in which a divesting person will be required to file for and obtain approval of the transaction. Some form of the 2010 amendments to the Model Holding Company Act has been adopted in all states. 
In 2012, the NAIC adopted the Risk Management and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (“ORSA”) Model Act, which requires domestic insurers to maintain a risk management framework and establishes a legal requirement for domestic insurers to conduct an ORSA in accordance with the NAIC’s ORSA Guidance Manual. The ORSA Model Act provides that domestic insurers, or their insurance group, must regularly conduct an ORSA consistent with a process comparable to the ORSA Guidance Manual process. The ORSA Model Act also provides that, no more than once a year, an insurer’s domiciliary regulator may request that an insurer submit an ORSA summary report, or any combination of reports that together contain the information described in the ORSA Guidance Manual, with respect to the insurer and the insurance group of which it is a member. The ORSA Model Act imposes more extensive filing requirements on parents and other affiliates of domestic insurers. Our insurance company subsidiaries are not subject currently to the requirements of the ORSA Model Act adopted in Nebraska, Texas and Vermont, respectively, however, will be when their direct written premiums and unaffiliated assumed premiums, if any, exceed $500 million. As of December 31, 2021, had direct written premiums of approximately $472 million. 
Privacy regulation 
Federal and state law and regulation require financial institutions to protect the security and confidentiality of personal information, including health-related and customer information, and to notify customers and other individuals about their policies and practices relating to their collection and disclosure of health-related and customer information and their practices relating to protecting the security and confidentiality of that information. State laws regulate the use and disclosure of social security numbers and federal and state laws require notice to affected individuals, law enforcement, regulators and others if there is a breach of the security of certain personal information, including social security numbers. Federal and state laws and regulations regulate the ability of financial institutions to make telemarketing calls and to send unsolicited e-mail or fax messages to consumers and customers. Federal and state lawmakers and regulatory bodies may be expected to consider additional or more detailed regulation regarding these subjects and the privacy and security of personal information. 

17



Cybersecurity regulation 
The NAIC adopted the Insurance Data Security Model Law in October 2017. This law establishes standards for data security and for the investigation and notification of certain cybersecurity events. As of the date of this filing, 11 states have adopted the model law or a variation of it. We expect that additional regulations could be enacted in other jurisdictions that could impact our cybersecurity program. Depending on these and other potential implementation requirements, we will likely incur additional costs of compliance.
