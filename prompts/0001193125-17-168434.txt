ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Overview 
 Ennis, Inc. (formerly Ennis Business Forms, Inc.) (we or the Company) was organized under the laws of Texas in 1909. The Company and its subsidiaries print and manufacture a broad line of business forms and other business products. We distribute business products and forms throughout the United States primarily through independent dealers. This distributor channel encompasses independent print distributors, commercial printers, direct mail, fulfillment companies, payroll and accounts payable software companies, and advertising agencies, among others. We also sell products to many of our competitors to satisfy their customers needs. 
 On April 1, 2016, we entered into a Unit Purchase Agreement (the Initial Purchase Agreement) with Alstyle Operations, LLC (the Initial Buyer) and, for the limited purpose set forth in the Initial Purchase Agreement, Steve S. Hong. Under the Initial Purchase Agreement, the Initial Buyer agreed to purchase our former apparel business by acquiring Alstyle Apparel, LLC and its subsidiaries (the Apparel Segment) from us for an aggregate purchase price of $88.0 million, consisting of $76.0 million in cash to be paid at closing, subject to a working capital adjustment, and an additional $12.0 million to be paid pursuant to a capital lease covering certain equipment utilized by the Apparel

 Segment that would be retained by us. The Initial Purchase Agreement contemplated post-closing transition services for up to 18 months. 
 Under the Initial Purchase Agreement, we retained the right to terminate the agreement in the event that the Company received an unsolicited purchase offer for the Apparel Segment that was not matched by the Initial Buyer, which, in the judgment of our Board of Directors (the Board) in the exercise of its fiduciary duties on behalf of the our shareholders, deemed such offer to be a superior offer to the transactions contemplated by the Initial Purchase Agreement. 
 On May 4, 2016, the Company received what the Board determined to be a superior offer from Gildan Activewear Inc. (Gildan). In connection therewith, we terminated the Initial Purchase Agreement and paid the required $3.0 million termination fee to the Initial Buyer. In connection with the superior offer, the Company and Gildan entered into a Unit Purchase Agreement, dated May 4, 2016 (the Gildan Purchase Agreement). On May 25, 2016, Gildan acquired the Apparel Segment for an all-cash purchase price of $110.0 million, subject to a working capital adjustment, customary indemnification arrangements, and the other terms of the Gildan Purchase Agreement. After the consummation of the sale, we provided transition assistance to Gildan for administrative, financial, human resource, and information technology matters, which ceased during the last quarter of fiscal year 2017, and we have been subleasing from Gildan a portion of a real property located in Anaheim, California. As part of the purchase price, Gildan funded our payment of the $3.0 million termination fee payable to the Initial Buyer in connection with the termination of the Initial Purchase. We filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission Current Reports on Form 8-K on May 4, 2016 and June 1, 2016 regarding the Gildan Purchase Agreement and the consummation of the sale of the Apparel Segment, respectively, and reference is made herein to those current reports for further explanation. 
 Based on certain tax elections, we anticipate that we will be able to treat the loss arising from the sale of the Apparel Segment as an operating loss for tax purposes. 
 On January 27, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Independent Printing Company, Inc. and its related entities (collectively Independent) for $17.7 million in cash consideration, in a stock purchase transaction. Independent has 4 locations in Wisconsin, with its main facility located in DePere, Wisconsin. The business produces presentation folders, checks, wide format and commercial printing. Independent, which generated approximately $37.0 million in unaudited sales during calendar year 2016, will continue to operate under its brand names. Independent sells mainly through distributors and resellers. With this acquisition, we now have 4 folder facilities located in Michigan, Kansas, California and Wisconsin, as well as wide format capabilities in Colorado and Wisconsin. 
 On August 12, 2016, we acquired the assets of Atlas Tag Company of Canada, Inc., located in Ontario, Canada, for $0.3 million in cash. Management considers this acquisition immaterial. On March 19, 2016, we acquired the assets of Major Business Systems, Inc., located in Hillsborough, North Carolina, for $0.6 million in cash. Management considers this acquisition immaterial. 
 During the fourth quarter of our previous fiscal year, we moved our folder operations from Omaha, Nebraska to Columbus, Kansas, due to the landlords desire to sell the facility. The move and inefficiencies associated with starting-up and training new employees had a negative impact on revenues and operational margins over the first half of fiscal year 2017. However, we have seen a turnaround and the operations have been marginally profitable for the last two quarters of the fiscal year ended February 28, 2017 and are expected to be even more profitable in the next fiscal year. In addition, our medical claims have exceeded historical levels during the fiscal year ended February 28, 2017, which resulted in us taking an additional $4.3 million charge to our earnings relating to these increased medical expenses. To mitigate against further medical charges, we implemented a new cost reimbursement program, as well as other changes to our health plan, as of the start of the new calendar year. However, while initial indications are positive and we believe that this program should reduce our medical claims expense to be more in line with historical levels, we are still in the early stages of this program and actual cost savings may vary from anticipated levels. 
 Business Overview 
 Our management believes we are the largest provider of business forms, pressure-seal forms, labels, tags, envelopes, and presentation folders to independent distributors in the United States.

We are in the business of manufacturing, designing and selling business forms and other printed business products primarily to distributors located in the United States. We operate 60 manufacturing plants throughout the United States in 22 strategically located states. Approximately 95% of the business products manufactured are custom and semi-custom products, constructed in a wide variety of sizes, colors, number of parts and quantities on an individual job basis depending upon the customers specifications. 
 The products sold include snap sets, continuous forms, laser cut sheets, tags, labels, envelopes, integrated products, jumbo rolls and pressure sensitive products in short, medium and long runs under the following labels: Ennis®, Royal Business Forms®, Block Graphics®, Specialized Printed Forms®, 360º Custom LabelsSM, ColorWorx®, Enfusion®, Uncompromised Check Solutions®, VersaSeal®, Witt Printing®, B&D Litho®, Genforms®, PrintGraphicsSM, Calibrated Forms®, PrintXcelSM, Printegra®, Curtis Business FormsSM, Falcon Business FormsSM, Forms ManufacturersSM, Mutual GraphicsSM, TRI-C Business FormsSM, Major Business SystemsSM, Hoosier Data Forms®, Hayes Graphics®, and Independent Printing®. We also sell the Adams McClure® brand (which provides Point of Purchase advertising for large franchise and fast food chains as well as kitting and fulfillment); the Admore®, Folder Express®, and Independent Folders® brands (which provide presentation folders and document folders); Ennis Tag & LabelSM (which provides custom printed high performance labels and custom and stock tags); Atlas Tag & Label®, Kay Toledo TagSM and Special Service PartnersSM (SSP) (which provides custom and stock tags and labels); Trade Envelopes®, Block Graphics®, Wisco® and National Imprint Corporation® (which provide custom and imprinted envelopes) and Northstar® and General Financial Supply® (which provide financial and security documents). 
 We sell predominantly through private printers and independent distributors, as well as to many of our competitors. Northstar also sells direct to a small number of customers, generally large banking organizations (where a distributor is not acceptable or available to the end-user). Adams McClure also sells direct to a small number of customers, where sales are generally through advertising agencies. 
 The printing industry generally sells its products either through sales made predominantly to end users, a market dominated by a few large manufacturers, such as R.R. Donnelley and Sons, Staples, Inc., Standard Register Co. (a subsidiary of Taylor Corporation), and Cenveo, Inc., or, like the Company, through a variety of independent distributors and distributor groups. While it is not possible, because of the lack of adequate public statistical information, to determine the Companys share of the total business products market, management believes the Company is the largest producer of business forms, pressure-seal forms, labels, tags, envelopes, and presentation folders in the United States distributing primarily through independent dealers. 
 There are a number of competitors that operate in this segment, ranging in size from single employee-owned operations to multi-plant organizations. We believe our strategic locations and buying power permit us to compete on a favorable basis within the distributor market on competitive factors, such as service, quality, and price. 
 Distribution of business forms and other business products throughout the United States is primarily done through independent dealers, including business forms distributors, resellers, direct mail, commercial printers, payroll and accounts payable software companies, and advertising agencies. 
 Raw materials principally consist of a wide variety of weights, widths, colors, sizes, and qualities of paper for business products purchased from generally one major supplier at favorable prices based on the volume of business. 
 Business products usage in the printing industry is generally not seasonal. General economic conditions and contraction of the traditional business forms industry are the predominant factor in quarterly volume fluctuations. 
 Patents, Licenses, Franchises and Concessions 
 Outside of the patent for the VersaSeal® product, we do not have any significant patents, licenses, franchises, or concessions. 
 Intellectual Property 
 We market our products under a number of trademarks and trade names. We have registered trademarks in the United States for Ennis®, EnnisOnlineSM, B&D Litho of AZ®, B&D Litho®, ACR®, Block Graphics®, Enfusion®,

We have similar trademark registrations internationally. The protection of our trademarks is important to our business. We believe that our registered and common law trademarks have significant value and these trademarks are important to our ability to create and sustain demand for our products. 
Customers 
 No single customer accounts for as much as five percent of our consolidated net sales. 
 Backlog 
 At February 28, 2017, our backlog of orders was approximately $14.9 million, as compared to approximately $18.9 million at February 29, 2016. 
 Research and Development 
 While we seek new products to sell through our distribution channel, there have been no material amounts spent on research and development in fiscal years 2017, 2016 or 2015. 
Environment 
 We are subject to various federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, wastewater discharges, air emissions and solid waste disposal. Our manufacturing processes do not emit substantial foreign substances into the environment. We do not believe that our compliance with federal, state, or local statutes or regulations relating to the protection of the environment has any material effect upon capital expenditures, earnings or our competitive position. There can be no assurance, however, that future changes in federal, state, or local regulations, interpretations of existing regulations or the discovery of currently unknown problems or conditions will not require substantial additional expenditures. Similarly, the extent of our liability, if any, for past failures to comply with laws, regulations, and permits applicable to our operations cannot be determined. 
Employees 
 At February 28, 2017, we had 2,348 employees. 215 are represented by labor unions under collective bargaining agreements, which are subject to periodic negotiations. 
 Available Information 
 We make our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 available free of charge under the Investors Relations page on our website, www.ennis.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
