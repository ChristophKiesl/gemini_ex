ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
12 ReTech Corporation is primarily a technology company focused on the retail experience, both online and in physical stores, for consumers and smaller merchants.
 
Our software, both deployed and in development, is designed to allow the smaller merchants to compete effectively with the retail behemoths like Walmart and Amazon, and to attract, retain, and delight consumers both online and in physical stores, without being dependent on Google, Facebook/Instagram, and Amazon.
 
Our AI Social Shopping platform App, which is currently in development, will allow merchants to connect with consumers directly, and will give merchants tools to protect their brand and lower their marketing costs which will be focused on results not just “looky-loos”.
 
For consumers, the App allows them to support their favourite local businesses and find new merchants that may be of interest to them, while earning money through their social communications and posts.
 
The Company has also acquired retail and wholesale operating companies that will allow us to test our tech on real consumers and demonstrate their success for other merchants while earning revenues for the Company.
 
As an innovative retail technology company that has been built through acquisitions and ideas, we will continue to search for additional synergistic acquisitions that bring incremental revenues and profitability, and access to products that will incentivize both merchants and consumers to quickly adopt our social shopping App.
 
The Opportunity:
 
The Company’s technology solutions are designed to benefit from the latest changes in the world-wide Retail market. Global retail sales were projected to be around 26.7 trillion U.S. dollars by 2022, up from approximately 23.6 trillion U.S. dollars in 2018. The retail industry encompasses the entire journey of a good or service. This typically starts with the manufacturing of a product, and ends with said product being purchased by a consumer from a retailer. Retail establishments come in many forms such as grocery stores, restaurants, and bookstores.
 
As a result of globalization and trade agreements between various markets and countries, many retailers are capable of doing business on a global scale. Many of the world’s leading retailers are American companies; Walmart, Amazon, The Kroger Co., Costco, and Target are examples of such American retailers with global reaches, with Walmart being the largest. The success of U.S. retailers can also be seen through their performance in online retail; the U.S. domestic market is lucrative and it is one in which many companies compete.
 
Our AI Social Shopping platform App is designed to allow smaller merchants to compete directly with these major retail chains without being dependent on “advertising” through competitors like Amazon, Facebook/Instagram, and Google, who ALL have their own shopping solutions.
 
We were contactless before it was cool!™ In 2018, we launched our 12 Sconti App in Europe which, among other things, allowed subscribed consumers to receive offers from participating nearby retailers, and make purchases right from their smart phone, then walk into the retailer and pick up their goods, just by showing their QR code. The lessons we learned from 12 Sconti are being applied to our new social shopping app, which is now in development.
 
The company, unlike many others, has weathered the Global storm caused by the Covid-19 Pandemic, and is poised to take advantage of the return to normalcy that is currently occurring in most markets, and assist smaller merchants through their recovery with our AI Social Shopping platform App to attract customers back to their businesses.
 
Our Acquisition Strategy:
 
The Company targets for acquisition those synergistic companies that provide immediate revenue and the potential for growth in revenue and earnings, and/or may provide entries to license or sell our software and technology to other businesses and consumer brands, and/or will provide support services to our existing operations. Therefore, we target acquisitions that can benefit from our technology platform and expertise to grow their operations, brands that can give us entry into other businesses, and other companies that can provide support for our brands and technologies.
 
We now target for acquisition those companies with at least $3 million in annual sales, and that have existing management teams which complement our own. We will also acquire smaller companies that, when added to our own, allow us to leverage our existing operations without significantly increasing our costs. Other candidates would be companies with existing software complimentary to our technology subsidiary, or companies where we can demonstrate the effectiveness of our technology. We are, of course, always looking to acquire larger companies or brands. In fact, we are still in talks with larger entities, but these are our minimum requirements.

Our Technology Rollout Strategy:
 
Our subsidiary 12 Tech has, through subsidiaries 12 Japan and 12 Hong Kong, already deployed and tested our existing USXS software applications at ITOYA LTD in Japan. Using the knowledge that we gained from that real-world experience, and adapting it to the post COVID-19 reality, we have begun to demonstrate some of our solutions in the United States of America.
 
During 2022, as the U.S. beings to re-open, we plan to deploy our technology in our own retail stores. By demonstrating the lift that our technology provides, we will then use our relationships that have been developed from our fashion brands to approach other businesses with these results, in order to license the software to them. However, until we launch our new social shopping app with features to allow users to interact with our screens, our existing technology will not be very effective as we believe that post-Covid, most consumers will be reluctant to touch a public touch-screen.
 
In the fourth quarter of 2022, we plan to announce and launch our new consumer-based AI Social Shopping platform App, to which any consumer-based business can subscribe, in order to reach and interact with consumers easily in fun and innovative ways, and especially contactless.

To ensure that the founder’s vision is maintained, it is necessary that no outsider person or group can gain voting control from the founder as the Company.
