ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
KBS Real Estate Investment Trust II, Inc. (the “Company”) is a Maryland corporation that has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) and it intends to operate in such a manner. As used herein, the terms “we,” “our” and “us” refer to the Company and as required by context, KBS Limited Partnership II, a Delaware limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership”), and their subsidiaries. We conduct our business primarily through our Operating Partnership, of which we are the sole general partner. Subject to certain restrictions and limitations, our business is managed by KBS Capital Advisors LLC (“KBS Capital Advisors”), our external advisor, pursuant to an advisory agreement. KBS Capital Advisors conducts our operations and manages our portfolio of real estate investments. Our advisor owns 20,000 shares of our common stock. We have no paid employees. 
As of December 31, 2020, we owned four office properties and an office building that is part of an office campus. 
As of December 31, 2020, we had 184,299,500 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. 
On November 13, 2019, in connection with a review of potential strategic alternatives available to us, a special committee composed of all of our independent directors (the “Special Committee”) and our board of directors unanimously approved the sale of all of our assets and our dissolution pursuant to the terms of the plan of complete liquidation and dissolution (the “Plan of Liquidation”). The principal purpose of the Plan of Liquidation is to provide liquidity to our stockholders by selling our assets, paying our debts and distributing the net proceeds from liquidation to our stockholders. On March 5, 2020, our stockholders approved the Plan of Liquidation. The Plan of Liquidation is included as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Plan of Liquidation
In accordance with the Plan of Liquidation, our objectives are to pursue an orderly liquidation of our company by selling all of our remaining assets, paying our debts and our known liabilities, providing for the payment of unknown or contingent liabilities, distributing the net proceeds from liquidation to our stockholders and winding up our operations and dissolving our company. While pursuing our liquidation pursuant to the Plan of Liquidation, we intend to continue to manage our portfolio of assets to maintain and, if possible, improve the quality and income-producing ability of our properties to enhance property stability and better position our remaining assets for sale. 
We expect to distribute substantially all of the net proceeds from liquidation to our stockholders within 24 months from March 5, 2020. Pursuant to the Plan of Liquidation, on March 5, 2020, our board of directors authorized an initial liquidating distribution in the amount of $0.75 per share of common stock to stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 5, 2020 (the “Initial Liquidating Distribution”). On July 31, 2020, our board of directors authorized a second liquidating distribution in the amount of $0.25 per share of common stock to stockholders of record as of the close of business on August 3, 2020 (the “Second Liquidating Distribution”), and on December 24, 2020, our board of directors authorized a third liquidating distribution in the amount of $0.40 per share of common stock to stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 24, 2020 (the “Third Liquidating Distribution”). We expect to continue to pay liquidating distribution payments to our stockholders through the completion of our liquidation process. However, if we cannot sell our assets and pay our debts within 24 months from March 5, 2020, or if the board of directors and the Special Committee determine that it is otherwise advisable to do so, pursuant to the Plan of Liquidation, we may transfer and assign our remaining assets to a liquidating trust. Upon such transfer and assignment, our stockholders will receive beneficial interests in the liquidating trust. 
Our expectations about the implementation of the Plan of Liquidation and the amount of any additional liquidating distributions that we will pay to our stockholders and when we will pay them are subject to risks and uncertainties and are based on certain estimates and assumptions, one or more of which may prove to be incorrect. As a result, the actual amount of any additional liquidating distributions we pay to stockholders may be more or less than we estimate and the liquidating distributions may be paid later than we predict. There are many factors that may affect the amount of liquidating distributions we will ultimately pay to our stockholders. If we underestimate our existing obligations and liabilities or the amount of taxes, transaction fees and expenses relating to the liquidation and dissolution, or if unanticipated or contingent liabilities arise, the amount of liquidating distributions ultimately paid to our stockholders could be less than estimated. Moreover, the liquidation value will fluctuate over time in response to developments related to individual assets in our portfolio and the management of those assets, in response to the real estate and finance markets, based on the actual liquidation timing and the amount of net proceeds received from the disposition of the remaining assets and due to other factors. Given the uncertainty and current business disruptions as a result of the outbreak of COVID-19, our implementation of the Plan of Liquidation may be materially and adversely impacted and this may have a material effect on the ultimate amount and timing of liquidating distributions received by our stockholders. While we have considered the impact from COVID-19 in our net assets in liquidation presented on the Consolidated Statement of Net Assets as of December 31, 2020, the extent to which our business may be affected by COVID-19 depends on future developments with respect to the continued spread and treatment of the virus, the actions taken to contain the pandemic or mitigate its impact, and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures. Any long-term impact of this situation, even after an economic rebound, remains unclear. See Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Market Outlook — Real Estate and Real Estate Finance Markets — COVID-19 Pandemic and Portfolio Outlook” for a discussion of the impact of the outbreak of COVID-19 on our business and our liquidation. We can give no assurance regarding the timing of asset dispositions in connection with the implementation of the Plan of Liquidation, the sale prices we will receive for our assets, and the amount or timing of liquidating distributions to be received by our stockholders. 
Real Estate Portfolio
Real Estate Investments
We made investments in core properties. We diversified our portfolio by investment size, investment type, investment risk and geographic region. As of December 31, 2020, our remaining portfolio of real estate properties was composed of four office properties and an office building that is part of an office campus. 
The following charts illustrate the geographic diversification of our real estate portfolio based on total leased square feet and total annualized base rent as of December 31, 2020: 
_____________________
(1) Annualized base rent represents contractual base rental income as of December 31, 2020, which has been annualized.
We have a stable tenant base and we have tried to diversify our tenant base in order to limit exposure to any one tenant or industry. As of December 31, 2020, our portfolio of real estate properties was 73% occupied. Three tenants leasing space in our portfolio of real estate properties represented more than 10% of our total annualized base rent as of December 31, 2020. See Item 2, “Properties — Concentration of Credit Risks.” 
Our top ten tenants in our portfolio of real estate properties represented approximately 72.5% of our total annualized base rent as of December 31, 2020. The chart below illustrates the diversity of tenant industries in our portfolio of real estate properties based on total annualized base rent as of December 31, 2020: 
_____________________
(1) Annualized base rent represents contractual base rental income as of December 31, 2020, which has been annualized.
(2) “Other professional services” includes professional services from several industries that are each individually less than 2% of total. 
(3) “Other” includes any industry less than 2% of total.
As of December 31, 2020, our highest tenant industry concentrations (greater than 10% of annualized base rent) of our real estate portfolio were as follows: 

Industry | Number of Tenants | Annualized Base Rent (1)(in thousands) | | Percentage ofAnnualized Base Rent
Finance | 10 | $ | 16,777 | | | 27.8 | %
Educational Services | 1 | 11,696 | | | 19.4 | % 
Mining, Oil & Gas Extraction | 4 | 10,967 | | | 18.2 | % 
 | | $ | 39,440 | | | 65.4 | %

_____________________
(1) Annualized base rent represents contractual base rental income as of December 31, 2020, which has been annualized. No other tenant industries accounted for more than 10% of annualized base rent.
The liquidation value of our real estate portfolio as of December 31, 2020 was $698.5 million. 
Financing Objectives
We financed the majority of our real estate investments with a combination of the proceeds we received from our initial public offering and debt. We used debt financing to increase the amount available for investment and to increase overall investment yields to us and our stockholders. We have also used debt financing to pay for capital improvements or repairs to properties; to refinance existing indebtedness; to pay distributions; to provide working capital and for other liquidity needs. 
As of December 31, 2020, we had $240.5 million of variable rate debt outstanding. As of December 31, 2020, the weighted-average interest rate of our variable debt was 1.7%. The interest rate represents the actual interest rate in effect as of December 31, 2020, using interest rate indices as of December 31, 2020, where applicable. 
The following is a schedule of maturities, including principal amortization payments, for all of our notes payable outstanding as of December 31, 2020 (in thousands): 

2021 | $ | 145,170
2022 | 5,175 | 
2023 | 90,175 | 
2024 | — | 
Thereafter | — | 
 | $ | 240,520

We plan to exercise our extension options available under our loan agreements, if applicable, or pay off or refinance the related notes payable prior to their maturity dates.
We limit our total liabilities to 75% of the cost (before deducting depreciation and other noncash reserves) of our tangible assets; however, we may exceed that limit if the majority of the conflicts committee approves each borrowing in excess of such limitation and we disclose such borrowings to our stockholders in our next quarterly report with an explanation from the conflicts committee of the justification for the excess borrowing. We did not exceed this limitation on borrowings during any quarter of 2020. As of December 31, 2020, our borrowings and other liabilities were approximately 37% of both the cost (before deducting depreciation and other noncash reserves) and book value (before deducting depreciation) of our tangible assets, respectively. 
Economic Dependency
We are dependent on our advisor for certain services that are essential to us, including the management of the daily operations of our real estate investment portfolio; the disposition of real estate investments; the execution of the Plan of Liquidation; and other general and administrative responsibilities. In the event that our advisor is unable to provide any of these services, we will be required to obtain such services from other sources. 
Competitive Market Factors
We face competition from various entities for prospective tenants and to retain our current tenants, including other REITs, pension funds, insurance companies, investment funds and companies, partnerships and developers. Many of these entities have substantially greater financial resources than we do and may be able to accept more risk than we can prudently manage, including risks with respect to the creditworthiness of a tenant. As a result of their greater resources, those entities may have more flexibility than we do in their ability to offer rental concessions to attract and retain tenants. This could put pressure on our ability to maintain or raise rents and could adversely affect our ability to attract or retain tenants. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic caused many tenants to re-evaluate their space needs, resulting in a significant increase in sublease space available in the office market from tenants wanting to unload un-needed space. We face competition from these tenants, who may be more willing to offer significant discounts to prospective subtenants. As a result, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and ability to successfully implement the Plan of Liquidation may be adversely affected. 
We also face competition from many of the types of entities referenced above regarding the disposition of properties. These entities may possess properties in similar locations and/or of the same property types as ours and may be attempting to dispose of these properties at the same time we are attempting to dispose of some of our properties, providing potential purchasers with a larger number of properties from which to choose and potentially decreasing the sales price for such properties. Additionally, these entities may be willing to accept a lower return on their individual investments, which could further reduce the sales price of such properties. Further, as a result of the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, real estate transaction volume has decreased with fewer buyers seeking to acquire commercial real estate properties. 
This competition could decrease the sales proceeds we receive for properties that we sell, assuming we are able to sell such properties, which could adversely affect our cash flows, the overall return for our stockholders and the amount and timing of liquidation distributions our stockholders receive.
Although we believe that we are well-positioned to compete effectively in each facet of our business, there is enormous competition in our market sector and there can be no assurance that we will compete effectively or that we will not encounter increased competition in the future that could limit our ability to conduct our business effectively and successfully implement the Plan of Liquidation. 
Compliance with Federal, State and Local Environmental Law
Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous real property owner or operator may be liable for the cost of removing or remediating hazardous or toxic substances on, under or in such property. These costs could be substantial. Such laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. Environmental laws also may impose liens on properties or restrictions on the manner in which properties may be used or businesses may be operated, and these restrictions may require substantial expenditures or prevent us from entering into leases with prospective tenants that may be impacted by such laws. Environmental laws provide for sanctions for noncompliance and may be enforced by governmental agencies or, in certain circumstances, by private parties. Certain environmental laws and common law principles could be used to impose liability for the release of and exposure to hazardous substances, including asbestos-containing materials and lead-based paint. Third parties may seek recovery from real property owners or operators for personal injury or property damage associated with exposure to released hazardous substances and governments may seek recovery for natural resource damage. The cost of defending against claims of environmental liability, of complying with environmental regulatory requirements, of remediating any contaminated property, or of paying personal injury, property damage or natural resource damage claims could reduce our cash available for distribution to our stockholders. 
All of our properties were subject to Phase I environmental assessments prior to the time they were acquired. Some of our properties are subject to potential environmental liabilities arising primarily from historic activities at or in the vicinity of the properties. Based on our environmental diligence and assessments of our properties and our purchase of pollution and remediation legal liability insurance with respect to some of our properties, we do not believe that environmental conditions at our properties are likely to have a material adverse effect on our operations. 
Industry Segments
We invested in core real estate properties and real estate-related investments with the goal of acquiring a portfolio of income-producing investments. Our real estate properties exhibit similar long-term financial performance and have similar economic characteristics to each other. Accordingly, we aggregated our investments in real estate properties into one reportable business segment. 
Human Capital
We have no paid employees. The employees of our advisor and its affiliates provide management, disposition, advisory and certain administrative services for us. 
Principal Executive Office
Our principal executive offices are located at 800 Newport Center Drive, Suite 700, Newport Beach, CA 92660. Our telephone number, general facsimile number and website address are (949) 417-6500, (949) 417-6501 and www.kbsreitii.com, respectively.
