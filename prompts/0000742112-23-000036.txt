GENERAL
Invacare Corporation (“Invacare,” the “company,” including its subsidiaries, unless otherwise noted) is a leading manufacturer and distributor in its markets for medical equipment used in non-acute care settings. At its core, the company designs, manufactures and distributes medical devices that help people to move, rest and perform essential hygiene. The company provides clinically complex medical device solutions for congenital (e.g., cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, spina bifida), acquired (e.g., stroke, spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, post-acute recovery, pressure ulcers) and degenerative (e.g., ALS, multiple sclerosis, age related, bariatric) conditions. The company's products are an important component of care for people facing a wide range of medical challenges, from those who are active and heading to work or school each day and may need additional mobility, to those who are cared for in residential care settings, at home and in rehabilitation centers. The company sells its products principally to home medical equipment providers, through retail and e-commerce channels, residential care operators, dealers and government health services in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific. Invacare's products are sold through its worldwide distribution network by its sales force, independent manufacturers' representatives, and distributors.
Invacare is committed to providing medical products that deliver the best clinical value; promote recovery, independence and active lifestyles; and support long-term conditions and palliative care. The company's global tagline - Yes, You Can.® is indicative of the “can do” attitude of many of the people who use the company's products and their care providers. In everything it does, the company strives to leave its stakeholders with its brand promise - Making Life's Experiences Possible®.
The company is a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Ohio in 1971. When the company was first established as a stand-alone enterprise in December 1979, it had $19.5 million in net sales and a limited product line of basic wheelchairs and patient aids. Since then, the company has made approximately fifty acquisitions and, after some recent divestitures to harmonize its portfolio, Invacare's net sales in 2022 were approximately $740 million. Based upon the company's distribution channels, breadth of product lines and net sales, Invacare is a leading company in many of the following medical product categories: custom power wheelchairs; custom manual wheelchairs; electromotive technology to augment wheelchairs and recreational products; recreational adaptive sports products; non-acute bed systems; and patient transfer and bathing equipment.

BANKRUPTCY
On January 31, 2023 (the “Petition Date”), the company and two of its U.S. subsidiaries (collectively, the “Debtors” or “Company Parties”) filed voluntary petitions under chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”) in the United Sates Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas (the “Bankruptcy Court”). The Debtors obtained joint administration of their chapter 11 cases under the caption In re Invacare Corporation, et al., Case No. 23-90068 (CML) (the “Chapter 11 Cases”). 
The Debtors continue to operate their business and manage their properties as “debtors-in-possession” under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court. To ensure ordinary course operations, the Company Parties obtained approval from the Bankruptcy Court for certain “first day” motions, including motions to obtain customary relief intended to continue ordinary course operations after the Petition Date. 
Restructuring Support Agreement
On January 31, 2023, the Debtors entered into a Restructuring Support Agreement (the “Restructuring Support Agreement” or “RSA”) with certain prepetition stakeholders (the “Consenting Stakeholders”). The Consenting Stakeholders represent holders of at least a majority of the aggregate principal amount of the Company Parties’ debt obligations under various debt agreements. Under the RSA, the Consenting Stakeholders have agreed, subject to certain terms and conditions, to support a financial restructuring (the “Restructuring”) of the existing debt of, existing equity interests in, and certain other obligations of the Debtors, The Restructuring Support Agreement contemplated: (a) the Debtors' entry into the $70 million debtor-in-possession term loan facility; (b) the Debtors' entry into the $17.4 million debtor-in-possession ABL facility; (c) the consummation of a rights offering, backstopped by members of the Ad Hoc Committee of Noteholders (the “Backstop Parties”) pursuant to a certain Backstop Commitment Agreement (as may be modified, amended, or supplemented from time to time, the “Backstop Commitment Agreement”); (d) issuance of the new common equity; (e) exit takeback financing in the form of an Exit Term Loan Facility and Exit Secured Convertible Notes, and (f) as necessary, exit financing in the form of the Exit NA ABL Facility and Exit EMEA ABL Facility. 



Part I 
Item 1. Business

Chapter 11 Plan
Since the Petition Date, the Debtors have developed the Restructuring Support Agreement into a chapter 11 plan of reorganization (as may be modified, amended, or supplemented from time to time, the “Plan”). The Plan, among other Plan treatment, contemplates the following:
•Each holder of an allowed term loan claim shall receive (i) with respect to allowed term loan claims representing principal amounts owed, its pro rata share of the exit term loan facility and (ii) with respect to allowed term loan claims representing principal amounts owed, its pro rata share of the exit term loan facility and (ii) with respect to all other allowed term loan claims, payment in full in cash. 
•Each holder of an allowed secured notes claim shall receive (i) with respect to allowed secured notes claims representing principal amounts owed, its pro rata share of the exit secured convertible notes and (ii) with respect to all other allowed secured notes claims, payment in full in cash; provided that, if applicable pursuant to and in accordance with the Plan, such holder will also receive its pro rata share of the applicable portion of the excess new money in cash. 
•Each holder of an allowed unsecured notes claim shall receive (i) the unsecured noteholder rights, in accordance with the rights offering procedures; (ii) with respect to any residual unsecured notes claims, its share (on a pro rata basis with other holders of allowed unsecured notes claims and holders of allowed general unsecured claims that select the class 6 equity option) of 100% of the new common equity after the distribution of the new common equity on account of the backstop commitment premium (subject to dilution on account of the exit secured convertible notes, the new convertible preferred equity, the backstop commitment premium, and the management incentive plan); (iii) and the distributions in respect of its litigation trust interests, to the extent provided in the Plan.
•Each holder of an allowed general unsecured claim shall receive its pro rata either (x) (i) if such holder of an allowed general unsecured claim does not elect to receive the class 6 equity option, the general unsecured claims cash settlement and (ii) its pro rata share of the distributions in respect of its litigation trust interests, to the extent provided in the Plan; or (y) if such holder of an allowed general unsecured claim elects to receive the class 6 equity option in lieu of the general unsecured creditors cash settlement, its share (on a pro rata basis with holders of allowed unsecured notes claims in respect of their residual unsecured 

notes claims and other holders of allowed general unsecured claims that select the class 6 equity option) of 100% of the new common equity after the distribution of the new common equity on account of the backstop commitment premium (subject to dilution on account of the exit secured convertible notes, the new convertible preferred equity, and the management incentive plan); and (z) its pro rata share of the distributions in respect of its litigation trust interests, to the extent provided in the Plan.
•All existing equity interests shall be discharged, cancelled, released, and extinguished without any distribution, and will be of no further force or effect, and each holder of an existing equity interest shall not receive or retain any distribution, property, or other value on account of such existing equity interest.
Although the company intends to pursue the Restructuring in accordance with the terms set forth in the Plan, there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in completing a restructuring or any other similar transaction on the terms set forth in the Plan, on different terms or at all. 
DIP Credit Agreements
The company and certain lenders (the “DIP Parties”) have agreed to a superpriority, senior secured and priming debtor-in-possession term loan credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $70 million subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the superpriority secured credit agreement dates as of February 2, 2023 (the “Term DIP Credit Agreement”) and a superpriority senior secured and priming debtor-in-possession asset-based revolving facility in an aggregate amount of $17.4 million subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the debtor-in-possession revolving credit and security agreement dated as of February 2, 2023 (the “ABL DIP Credit Agreement” and together with the Term DIP Credit Agreement, the “DIP Credit Agreements”).

THE NON-ACUTE DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT INDUSTRY
The non-acute durable medical equipment market includes a broad range of equipment and services that enable the care and lifestyle needs of individuals with a broad range of conditions. With expected long-term pressure to control healthcare spending per capita, the company believes the market for equipment and services that support higher acuity care in lower acuity settings will continue to grow. Healthcare payors and providers continue to seek to optimize therapies which result in improved outcomes, reduced cost protocols, and ultimately, earlier discharge, including recovery and treatment in non-acute settings. Care in these settings may reduce exposure to concomitant issues and be preferred by patients.
As healthcare costs continue to increase, the interests of patients and healthcare providers are converging to focus on the most cost-effective delivery of the best care. As healthcare payors become more judicious in their spending, companies that provide better care or demonstrate better clinical outcomes will have an advantage. With its diverse product portfolio, clinical solutions, global scale and focus on the non-acute care 

setting, the company believes it is well positioned to serve this growing market.
Macro trends are impacting the world's aging population. While institutional care will likely remain an important part of healthcare systems in the wealthiest economies, the company believes care settings other than traditional hospitals will increasingly provide higher acuity care. With a broad product offering, diversified channels of trade, and infrastructure capable of serving many of the largest healthcare economies, the company believes it is well positioned to benefit from these global demographic trends and changes to the provision of healthcare.
North America Market
The population of the United States is growing and aging. As a result, there is a greater prevalence of disability among major U.S. population groups and an increasing need for assistance and care. The U.S. Census Bureau has projected the U.S. population will continue to grow to an estimated 400 million by 2050. Along the way, the bolus of Baby Boomers is expected to continue to raise the average age of the U.S. population. By 2030, the government estimates that more than 20% of the U.S. population will consist of individuals over the age of 65, a 50% increase compared to the population in 2010.
In the United States, healthcare provision is supported by reimbursement from the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”), the Department of Veterans Affairs, state agencies, private payors and healthcare recipients themselves. In total, CMS estimates U.S. national healthcare expenditures will grow by more than 5% annually between 2019 and 2028. At this rate, healthcare spending would exceed GDP growth by 1%, which will sustain pressure to deploy care in ways that deliver the best outcomes for lower cost.
The Canadian health care system is a publicly funded model that provides coverage to all citizens. Provinces and territories are primarily responsible for the administration and delivery of Canada's health care services, and all health insurance plans are expected to meet the national guidelines established by the Canada Health Act. The objective of the Canada Health Act is to provide consumer-centered support and funding to residents with long-term physical disabilities and to provide access to personalized assistive devices that meet the basic needs of each patient. Each provincial and territorial health insurance plan differs with respect to reimbursement policies and product specification standards, allowing healthcare services to be adjusted based on regional needs. Invacare sells across Canada, taking into consideration the regional differences among the various provinces and territories.

Item 1. Business

Europe, Middle East and Africa Markets
While the healthcare equipment market in each country in Europe has distinct characteristics, many of the factors driving demand and affecting reimbursement are consistent with those in North America: population aging; more patients with chronic illnesses; an increasing preference to deliver healthcare outside hospitals; and a focus on the use of technology to increase productivity and reduce ancillary costs. Each European country has variations in product specifications and service requirements, regulations, distribution needs and reimbursement policies. These differences, as well as differences in the competitive landscape, require the company to tailor its approach based on the local market and the reimbursement requirements into which the products are being sold. The company's core strategy is to address these distinct markets with global product platforms that are localized with country-specific adjustments as necessary. This is especially the case for power wheelchairs and manual wheelchairs. Customers in all European markets typically make product selections based upon quality, features, alignment with local reimbursement requirements, ability to reduce total cost of care, and customer service.
The company serves various markets in Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa. It approaches these markets with the global portfolio of products developed and manufactured elsewhere. Sales in these markets are made somewhat opportunistically to balance changes in demand and specific product requirements. Often, sales in the Middle East and Africa represent episodic tenders as well as in some cases consistent sustained trade over the years. Most of the company's sales in these markets result from business conducted in Western Europe, as well as through dedicated local distributors.
Asia Pacific Market
The company's Asia Pacific market comprises revenue from products sold in Australia, New Zealand, China, Japan, Korea, India and Southeast Asia. Invacare's Asia Pacific businesses sell through multiple channels. Mobility and seating products are sold directly in New Zealand and through a network of dealers in all other countries, with almost all sales funded to reimbursed levels directly by governmental payors. Homecare products are sold via a dealer network that sells products to the consumer market. Long-term care products are sold via a dealer network and directly to care facilities. The company operates a rental business in New Zealand supporting the three largest hospital districts on New Zealand's North Island. Sales to other parts of Asia are sold via distributors and agents based in China, Japan, Korea, India and Southeast Asia. The company has a distribution and assembly center in Thailand. 

Reimbursement
In most markets, the company does not make significant sales directly to end-users. In some markets, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, New Zealand and certain Scandinavian countries, the company sells directly to a government payor. In other markets, the company's customers purchase products to have available for use by, or re-sale to, end-users. These customers then work with end-users to determine what equipment may be needed to address the end-user's particular medical needs. Products are then provided to the end-user, and the company's customer may seek reimbursement on behalf of the end-user or sell the products, as appropriate. Product mix, pricing and payment terms vary by market. The company believes its market position and technical expertise will allow it to respond to ongoing changes in demand and reimbursement.
PRODUCT CATEGORIES
The company designs, manufactures, markets and distributes products in two key product categories: Mobility and Seating and Lifestyle.
Mobility and Seating
•Power Wheelchairs. This product category includes complex power wheelchairs for individuals who require powered mobility. The company's power wheelchair product offerings include products that can be highly customized to meet an individual end-user's needs, as well as products that are inherently versatile and designed to meet a broad range of requirements. Center-wheel drive power wheelchair lines include the Invacare® TDX® SP2 (Total Driving eXperience) product line and the ROVI® X3 and A3 power base product line, offered through the company's Motion Concepts subsidiary. ROVI® is a registered trademark owned by Shoprider Mobility Products, Inc. The TDX SP2 line of power wheelchairs offers a combination of power, stability and maneuverability, including the Invacare® SureStep® suspension system with Stability Lock and available G-Trac™ Technology. Seating systems offer elevate, power tilt and recline features. The ROVI A3 also offers the Multi-Positioning-Standing-MAXX System (MPS), an innovative, highly adjustable system that provides consumers the medical benefits of adjusting to a standing position throughout the day, adding additional independence, function and accessibility.
The company also offers rear-wheel and front-wheel drive power wheelchair technology through the Invacare® AVIVA® Power Wheelchairs, a new 



Part I 
Item 1. Business

generation of power products. The rear-wheel drive chair has become a leader in some markets thanks to its innovation suspension technology. AVIVA® expanded the portfolio and provided new market share opportunities. Several of the company's subsidiaries specialize in the development and implementation of complementary technology designed to enhance the utility of wheelchairs to meet unique and complex physiological needs. For example, Adaptive Switch Labs has developed alternative electronic control systems and human/machine input devices that enable wheelchair and environmental control via alternative interfaces to joysticks, such as sip/puff, and head position inputs. Motion Concepts designs and produces custom powered seating and power positioning systems. Alber GmbH sells innovative power add-on devices that enable manual wheelchair users to have optional electric power to augment manual propulsion and enable caretakers to easily maneuver manual wheelchairs. The company continues to be a leader in this market with unique intellectual property in wheelchair suspension, seating, alternative controls, and electronic components.
•Manual and Custom Manual Wheelchairs. The company provides a wide range of mobility solutions for everyday activities. The company offers a wide range of highly customized and standard box wheelchairs with superior features and functionality. Cross compatible and adjustable across the portfolio with some wheelchairs that can be folded to fit into very small spaces for ease of transportability.
These products are sold for use in the home and in institutional care settings. Users include people who are chronically or temporarily-disabled, require basic mobility with little or no frame modification, and may propel themselves or be moved by a caregiver. 
The company's standard / manual wheelchairs are marketed under the Invacare® brand name. Examples include the 9000 and Tracer® wheelchair product lines in North America, as well as the Action family in Europe. 
The company also offers custom manual wheelchairs for independent everyday use under the Invacare® brand name. The company markets a premiere line of lightweight, aesthetically-stylish custom manual wheelchairs under the Küschall® brand name. It was relaunched during 2020 and has been continuously growing in customer demand since then. Thanks to new Hydroforming technology, the rigidity and the driving performance of chairs improved significantly while the weight has been reduced. This new 

technology has allowed Invacare to increase its price in the market and gain competitive advantage.
•Seating and Positioning Products. At the core of care for seated end-users is the need for proper seating and positioning. Invacare designs, manufactures and markets some of the industry's best custom seating and positioning systems, custom molded and modular seat cushions, back supports and accessories to enable care givers to optimize the posture of their patients in mobility products. The Invacare® Seating and Positioning series provides seating solutions for less complex end-user needs. The Invacare® Matrx® Series offers versatile modular seating components with unique proprietary designs and materials designed to optimize pressure management and to help ensure long-term proper posture. The company's Pin Dot® series provides custom molded seat modules that can accommodate the most unique anatomic needs, and that can be adapted to fit with a wide range of mobility products. The company's ability to rapidly produce highly-customized products is highly specialized in the market, and is valued by therapists who need timely solutions for their patient's most complex clinical needs. Through Invacare One Solution, the company promotes its seating solutions integrated with its Manual & Power Wheelchairs offer. This initiative was launched in Europe in 2021 on Küschall® wheelchairs range and rolled out to the rest of the portfolio. 
•Power Add-Ons The company sells innovative power add-on devices that enable manual wheelchair users to have optional electric power to augment manual propulsion and enable caretakers to more easily maneuver manual wheelchairs. This product category includes six main product lines: stairclimbers (scalamobil® and scalacombi); push and brake aids (viamobil® and viamobil eco), push-rim activated power assists (e-motionTM, twion®, SMOOV®), Joystick controlled add-on kits (e-fix® and Esprit); Handbikes (e-pilot®) and E-Bike drive train components (neodrives®). Add-on drives can be retrofitted to almost any manual wheelchair. The products are characterized by their light weight design and compactness, which makes them an ideal travel companion. Highly efficient hub motors along with the latest lithium-ion battery technology are used to enhance freedom of movement for users and their caregivers.
Lifestyle Products
•Pressure Relieving Sleep Surfaces. This product category includes a complete line of therapeutic pressure redistributing overlays and mattress replacement systems. Invacare's portfolio consists of 



Part I 
Item 1. Business

well-known and respected brand names such as Softform, Dacapo, Propad and microAirTM and offer a broad range of pressure redistributing foam mattresses, hybrid mattresses, and powered mattresses with alternating pressure, low-air-loss, or rotational design features, which redistribute weight and assist with microclimate management. These mattresses are designed to provide comfort, support, and pressure redistribution to those patients who are immobile or have limited mobility; who may have fragile skin or be susceptible to skin breakdown; and who spend long periods in bed. In the last few years, the company has focused within the category on sustainability and reducing complexity within the portfolio. 
•Safe Patient Handling. This product category includes products needed to assist caregivers in transferring individuals from surface to surface (e.g., bed to chair). Designed for use in the home or in institutional settings, these products include ceiling and floor lifts, sit-to-stand devices, and a comprehensive line of slings. The company has very strong development in these areas thanks to numerous launches in the last year; Birdie™, Evo, ISA™, and new Optislings.
•Beds. This product category includes a wide variety of Invacare® branded semi-electric and fully-electric bed systems designed for both residential and institutional care for a range of patient sizes. It includes bed accessories, such as bedside rails, overbed tables, and trapeze bars. The company's bed systems introduced the split-spring bed design, which is easier for home medical equipment providers to deliver, assemble and clean than other bed designs. Invacare's bed systems also feature patented universal bed-ends, where the headboard and footboard may be used interchangeably for improved user experience. 
•Personal Care. This product category includes a full line of personal care products, including bathing safety aids, such as tub transfer benches and shower chairs, as well as patient care products, such as commodes and other toileting aids. In markets where payors value durable long-lasting devices, especially those markets outside of North America, personal care products continue to be an important part of the company's lifestyle products business. 
Other Products and Services
The company also distributes ambulatory aids, such as rollators, walkers, and wheeled walkers, but as of 2020, it has deprioritized and streamlined to improve overall business efficiencies. 

Other products and services include various services, including repair services, equipment rentals and external contracting. In certain regions of Europe and Asia Pacific, refurbishing of products is increasing as governments look for ways to lower costs while still providing needed equipment. A range of distributed products including a heart rate monitor, thermometer and nebulizer were launched for the Asia Pacific market. Portable ramps are sold throughout Asia and Europe, largely to public transport providers.
After careful evaluation of strategic options and its core revenue streams, the company decided to exit its respiratory line of products in the fourth quarter of 2022 and sold assets related to the respiratory product line in January of 2023. In addition, in January 2023, the company sold its Top End® sports and recreational wheelchair product line.
GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENTS
Europe
The company's Europe segment operates as an integrated unit across the European, Middle Eastern and African markets with sales and operations throughout Europe. The Europe segment is coordinated with other global business units for new product development, supply chain resources and additional corporate resources. This segment primarily includes mobility and seating and lifestyle product lines. Products are sold through home healthcare providers and government provider agencies. In total, the Europe segment comprised 58.6%, 57.2% and 55.0% of net sales in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
North America
The company's North America segment comprises sales and operations throughout the United States, Mexico and Canada. This segment primarily includes mobility and seating and lifestyle product lines. Products are sold through rehabilitation providers, home healthcare providers, and government provider agencies, such as the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.

For financial information regarding reportable segments, including revenues from external customers, products, segment profitability, assets and other information by segments, refer to Business Segments in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
WARRANTY
Generally, the company's products are covered by warranties against defects in material and workmanship for product-specific warranty periods starting from the date of sale to the customer. Certain components, principally wheelchair and bed frames, carry a lifetime warranty.
COMPETITION
The durable medical equipment markets are highly competitive, and Invacare products face significant competition from other well-established manufacturers and distributors in the industry. Each country into which the company sells and markets its products has a set of unique conditions that impact competition, including healthcare coverage, forms and levels of reimbursement, presence of payor and provider structures and various competitors. Many factors may play a role in the selection of products and success of the company including specific features, aesthetics, quality, availability, service levels and price. Various competitors, from time to time, have instituted price-cutting programs in an effort to gain market share, and they may do so again in the future. In addition, reimbursement pressures may continue to persist in major markets, such as the U.S. These pressures have and may again significantly alter market dynamics. Increasingly, customers have access to manufacturers in low-cost locations and are able to source certain products directly in lieu of purchasing from Invacare or its traditional competitors, particularly for less complex products where price is the primary selection criterion. 
The company believes that successfully increasing its market share is dependent on its ability to provide value to its customers based on clinical benefits, quality, performance, and durability of the company's products and services. In addition, the company's cost reduction achievements are expected to improve the market competitiveness of its products. Customers also value the technical and clinical expertise of the company's sales force, the effectiveness of the company's distribution system, the strength of its dealer and distributor network, the availability of prompt and reliable service for its products, and the ease of doing business with the company. The company's focus on quality is paramount. By 

embracing quality in all aspects of the company's activities, the company believes that its products will be better aligned with customer needs and brought to market more quickly, resulting in a better customer experience and economic return. 
SALES, MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION
Europe
The company's European operations primarily conduct manufacturing, marketing and distribution functions in Western Europe and coordinate export sales activities through local distributors for markets in Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa. The company utilizes an employee sales force and independent distributors. In markets where the company has its own sales force, product sales are made to medical equipment dealers and directly to government agencies. Marketing functions are staffed by central and regional teams to optimize coverage and content. The company operates distribution centers in various locations to optimize cost and delivery performance.
Since the pandemic, the company has utilized webinars and digital events. Starting in 2022, attendance at trade shows has resumed across the European and Middle eastern geographies. The company builds brand awareness through a strong presence in social media (LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram) and has a dedicated blog. Invacare continues to increase the knowledge and awareness of its products by interacting with its target audience through various digital marketing channels including Facebook, YouTube, blog, Instagram, LinkedIn and inbound email marketing actions, as well as improving the customer experience with its renewed websites. In some European countries, the company sponsors key events and several individual wheelchair athletes and teams. In addition, every year the company conducts numerous marketing campaigns targeted to dealers, therapists, and end users to promote current and new products.
North America
In the United States, Invacare products are marketed primarily to clinical specialists in rehabilitation centers, long-term care facilities, hospice facilities, government agencies and residential care settings. The company markets to these medical professionals, who refer their patients to rehabilitation, HME, and government providers to obtain specific types of the company's medical equipment. The company sells its products to these providers.
In 2022, the North America sales force was focused on mobility and seating products and lifestyle solutions to

Item 1. Business

support customer needs. The sales force is comprised of both inside and outside representatives.
The company contributes extensively to editorial coverage in trade publications concerning the products the company manufactures. Company representatives attend numerous online trade shows and conferences on a national and regional basis in which Invacare products are displayed to providers, health care professionals, managed care professionals and consumers. The company also drives brand awareness through its website, as well as online communities of people who may use its products. 
The company raises consumer awareness of its products through a strong presence in social and digital media as well as its support of various philanthropic causes benefiting consumers of the company's products. In addition, the company supports disabled veterans with its continuous sponsorship of the National Veterans Wheelchair Games, the largest annual wheelchair sporting event in the world. These sporting events bring a competitive and recreational sports experience to military veterans who, due to spinal cord injury, neurological conditions or amputation, use various assistive technology devices for their mobility needs.
The company's products are distributed through a network of facilities and directly from some manufacturing sites to optimize cost, inventory and delivery performance.
All Other
All Other comprises revenue primarily from Australia and New Zealand and to a lesser extent from other regions of the Asia Pacific market. The New Zealand revenues include rental of durable medical equipment. It uses an employee sales force and service representatives to support this revenue. Complex rehabilitation products are assembled in Thailand and sourced from global sources via a network of distribution nodes designed to optimize cost, inventory and delivery performance.
Sales and marketing efforts in Asia Pacific region are managed within the region and leveraged from other regions of the company. Sponsorship efforts are focused at the grass roots level and around programs designed to introduce people with disabilities to sports as a pathway to inclusion. Invacare APAC is very active on social media and online platforms and has created a community following whereby end-users, dealers, carers and healthcare professionals activity participate in two way discussions, polls, blogs and competitions thereby increasing brand awareness throughout the region. Customers are also encouraged to utilize Invacare marketing capability and skills to assist them in marketing and selling Invacare products through their respective dealerships. 

PRODUCT LIABILITY COSTS
The company was self-insured in North America for product liability exposures through its captive insurance company, Invatection Insurance Company, which had a policy year that ran from September 1 to August 31 and insured annual policy losses up to $10,000,000 per occurrence and $13,000,000 in the aggregate. The company has additional layers of external insurance coverage, related to all lines of insurance, insuring up to $75,000,000 in aggregate losses per policy year arising from individual claims anywhere in the world that exceed the captive insurance company policy limits or the limits of the company's per-country foreign liability limits, as applicable. There can be no assurance that Invacare's current insurance levels will continue to be adequate or available at affordable rates.
Product liability reserves are recorded for individual claims based upon historical experience, industry expertise and other indicators. Additional reserves, in excess of the specific individual case reserves, are provided for incurred unreported claims based upon actuarial valuations at the time such valuations are conducted. Historical claims experience and other assumptions are taken into consideration by the company in estimating the ultimate reserves. For example, the actuarial analysis assumes that historical loss experience is an indicator of future experience, that the distribution of exposures by geographic area and nature of operations for ongoing operations is expected to be very similar to historical operations with no dramatic changes and that the government indices used to trend losses and exposures are appropriate. Estimated amounts used in the calculation of reserves are adjusted on a regular basis and can be impacted by actual loss awards and claim settlements. While actuarial analysis is used to help determine adequate reserves, the company is responsible for determining and recording adequate reserves in accordance with accepted loss reserving standards and practices and applicable accounting principles.
Subsequent to the 2022 year-end and as a result of the bankruptcy filing, Invatection Insurance Company has been dissolved. The company will continue to be self-insured for product liability exposures in North America on a go-forward basis.
PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND ENGINEERING
The company's strategy includes developing meaningful new products in key markets and product areas. As the result of work among the company's development groups in North America, Europe and Asia, Invacare launched a series of new innovations in 2022, including the following:

With its powerful battery, it also covers longer distances with first-class workmanship and high-quality materials.
The engineering teams also focused on portfolio and product optimization projects during the year. 
MANUFACTURING AND SUPPLIERS
The company's objective is to efficiently deploy resources in its supply network to achieve the best quality, service performance and lowest total cost. The company seeks to achieve this result through a combination of inputs from Invacare facilities, contract manufacturers and key suppliers.
The company continues to emphasize quality excellence and efficiency across its manufacturing and distribution operations. The company is expanding its culture of deploying current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) and Lean Manufacturing principles to eliminate waste throughout the network and will continue to pursue improvements in its manufacturing processes. At its core, the company's operations produce and distribute both custom-configured products for use in specialized clinical situations and standard products.
The company procures raw materials, components and finished goods from a global network of internal and external sources. The company utilizes regional sourcing offices to identify, develop and manage its external supply base. Where appropriate, Invacare utilizes suppliers across multiple regions to ensure flexibility, continuity and 

responsiveness. The company's network of engineering design centers, product management groups and sources of supply are used to optimize cost and satisfy customer demand. 
The company continually reviews its operations network capacity, workforce skills and technologies along with its distribution network to optimize design, manufacture, sourcing and delivery performance, inventory and cost.
Europe
The company's manufacturing and assembly facilities in Europe are operated as centers of excellence, i.e., factories, with specific capabilities. The company manufactures power wheelchair products, wheelchair power add-ons and hygiene products in one single facility in Albstadt, Germany. Manual wheelchair production is based in Fondettes, France. The company manufactures beds in Porto, Portugal and Diö, Sweden for various markets. Invacare manufactures therapeutic support surfaces as well as seating and positioning products in Pencoed, Wales. The Europe segment uses these internal sources and also external sources of finished goods and components to create the portfolio of products it distributes. Products manufactured or assembled in Europe are sold to external European customers as well as to other internal customers.
North America
The company operates several vertically integrated centers of excellence, i.e., factories, in North America, each with specific capabilities: custom powered wheelchairs and seating products in Elyria, OH; manual and passive manual wheelchairs, safe patient handling and patient aids in Reynosa, MX; beds in Sanford, FL; passive manual and pediatric wheelchairs in Simi Valley, CA; and seating and positioning systems in Toronto, Canada. Products designed and produced in North American operations are sold in North America and are shipped as finished goods and as subcomponents to internal and external customers globally. 
Asia Pacific
Invacare Asia Pacific assembles components used primarily in rehabilitation products that serve Asia Pacific markets at a facility based in Thailand. The company operates a centralized distribution node in Thailand, with additional nodes in Australia and New Zealand, to supply customer needs while optimizing cost, inventory and service levels.

STRATEGY
With the changes to senior management and the Board of Directors in the third quarter of 2022, and after careful evaluation of strategic options, the company concluded that the lifestyle and mobility & seating businesses are core to restoring growth and profitability. As a result, the company decided to discontinue the production and sale of respiratory products. This will allow the company to further streamline its operations and improve profitability by focusing resources on lifestyle and mobility & seating products, which continue to experience strong demand. The company will continue to be subject to its warranty and regulatory obligations related to respiratory products.
The company's anticipated business optimization actions balance product portfolio changes across all regions and cost improvements in supply chain and administrative functions. Key elements of the global business optimization plans are:
•Focus on lifestyle and mobility & seating product lines based on their potential to achieve a leading market position and to support profitability goals;
•Simplify the organization to leverage a reduced cost structure while allocating resources to the business units or product categories which deliver improved financial returns;
•Product rationalization and discontinuance with consideration of cost increases incurred by the company and those anticipated to continue. Adjust the product portfolio to consistently grow profitability amid cost increases by adding new products, reducing costs and continuing to improve customer experiences; and
•Take actions globally to reduce working capital and improve free cash flow.
As it navigates the uncertain business environment, the company continues to allocate more resources to the business units experiencing increased demand and expects to continue taking actions to mitigate the potential negative financial and operational impacts on other parts of the business that have declined. 
The company intends to continue to make investments in its business improvement initiatives with a focus on improving profitability and free cash flow generation. As a result, the company may take actions which may reduce sales in certain areas, refocus resources away from less profitable activities, and look at its global infrastructure for opportunities to further optimize the business. As part of the company’s efforts to streamline its operations and focus its resources on core product lines that provide the greatest value and financial returns, the company continuously evaluates opportunities and 

activities, including potential divestitures, which it considers from time to time, particularly if they involve businesses or assets outside of the company’s primary areas of focus.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
The company is governed by regulations that affect the manufacture, distribution, marketing and sale of its products and regulate healthcare reimbursement that may affect its customers and the company directly. Reimbursement policies differ among and within every country in which the company operates. Changes in regulations, guidelines, procedural precedents, enforcement and healthcare policy take place frequently and can impact the size, growth potential and profitability of products sold in each market.
In many markets, healthcare costs have been consistently increasing in excess of the rate of inflation and as a percentage of GDP. Efforts to control payor's budgets have impacted reimbursement levels for healthcare programs. Private insurance companies often mimic changes in government programs. Reimbursement guidelines in the home healthcare industry have a substantial impact on the nature and type of equipment consumers can obtain and thus, affect the product mix, pricing and payment patterns of the company's customers who are typically the medical equipment providers to end-users.
FDA
 The United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) regulates the manufacture, distribution and marketing of medical devices. Under such regulation, medical devices are classified as Class I, Class II or Class III devices, depending on the level of risk posed to patients, with Class III designating the highest-risk devices. The company's principal products are designated as Class I or Class II. In general, Class I devices must comply with general controls, including, but not limited to, requirements related to establishment registration and device listing, labeling, medical device reporting, and the Quality System Regulation (QSR). In addition to general controls, certain Class II devices must comply with design controls, premarket notification and clearance, and applicable special controls. Domestic and foreign manufacturers of medical devices sold in the U.S. are subject to routine inspections by FDA. In addition, some foreign governments have adopted regulations relating to the design, manufacture and marketing of health care products, and imposing similar controls as the FDA regulations.
2012 Consent Decree, Taylor Street and Corporate Facilities



Part I 
Item 1. Business

In December 2012, the company became subject to a consent decree of injunction filed by FDA with respect to the company's Corporate Headquarters and its Taylor Street facility's operations in Elyria, Ohio. The consent decree initially limited the company's (i) manufacture and distribution of power and manual wheelchairs, wheelchair components and wheelchair sub-assemblies at or from its Taylor Street manufacturing facility (“Taylor Street Products”), except in verified cases of medical necessity, (ii) design activities related to wheelchairs and power beds that take place at the impacted Elyria facilities and (iii) replacement, service and repair of products already in use and supplied from the Taylor Street manufacturing facility. Under the terms of the consent decree, in order to resume full operations, the company had to successfully complete independent, third-party expert certification audits at the impacted Elyria facilities, comprised of three distinct certification reports separately submitted to, and accepted by, the FDA; submit its own report to the FDA; and successfully complete a reinspection by the FDA of the company's Corporate and Taylor Street facilities. 
On July 24, 2017, following its June 2017 reinspection of the Corporate and Taylor Street facilities, the FDA notified the company that it was in substantial compliance with the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDA Act”), FDA regulations and the terms of the consent decree and that the company was permitted to resume full operations at those facilities including the resumption of unrestricted sales of products made in those facilities.
Since July 24, 2017, an independent expert audit firm retained by the company retained by the company conducted two semi-annual audits in the first year and then four annual audits in the next four years of the company's Corporate and Taylor Street facilities, as required under the consent decree. The expert audit firm determined that the facilities remained in continuous compliance with the FDA Act, FDA regulations and the terms of the consent decree and issued post-audit reports contemporaneously to the FDA. The FDA has the authority to inspect these facilities and any other FDA registered facility, at any time.
In 2021, FDA conducted an inspection of the company’s Corporate and Taylor Street facilities from May 25 through June 24, 2021. At the close of the inspection, six FDA Form 483 observations were issued, and the company timely responded to FDA, has diligently taken actions to address FDA’s inspectional observations, and has provided FDA regular updates on the corrective actions taken to address these observations. On November 18, 2021, the company received a warning letter from the FDA concerning certain of the inspectional observations in the June 2021 FDA Form 483 related to the complaint handling process, the corrective and preventive action 

(“CAPA”) process, and medical device reporting (“MDR”) associated with oxygen concentrators (the “Warning Letter”). On November 16, 2021, the company received a consent decree non-compliance letter from the FDA concerning the same complaint and CAPA handling matters as in the Warning Letter observations but associated with the Taylor Street products (this letter, together with the Warning Letter, the “FDA Letters”). The company timely responded to the FDA Letters, has diligently taken actions to address FDA’s concerns, and has provided FDA with periodic updates on the corrective actions taken to address the matters in the FDA Letters. The company remains committed to resolving the FDA’s concerns; however, it is not possible to predict the outcome or timing of a resolution at this time. There can be no assurance that the FDA will be satisfied with the company’s responses to the FDA Letters, nor any assurance as to the timeframe that may be required for the company to adequately address the FDA’s concerns or whether the matters in the FDA Letters will result in an extension in the duration of the consent decree. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Regulatory and Development Risks” for further discussion of potential adverse effects on the company of non-compliance with medical device regulatory requirements. As of the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, there has been no impact on the company’s ability to produce and market its products as a result of the FDA Letters.
The FDA conducted an inspection at the company’s Alber GmbH facility in Albstadt, Germany from December 12 through December 15, 2022. At the completion of the inspection, the FDA issued no findings or observations. 
The FDA conducted an inspection at the company’s Corporate and Taylor Street facilities from March 1 through March 30, 2023. At the conclusion of the inspection, two FDA Form 483 observations were issued. The company intends to timely respond to the FDA and address the observations.
Under the consent decree, the FDA has the authority to order the company to take a wide variety of actions if the FDA finds that the company is not in compliance with the consent decree, FDA Act or FDA regulations, including requiring the company to cease all operations relating to Taylor Street products. The FDA also can order the company to undertake a partial cessation of operations or a recall, issue a safety alert, public health advisory, or press release, or to take any other corrective action the FDA deems necessary with respect to Taylor Street products. 
The FDA also has authority under the consent decree to assess liquidated damages of $15,000 per violation per day for any violations of the consent decree, FDA 



Part I 
Item 1. Business

regulations or the FDA Act. The FDA also may assess liquidated damages for shipments of adulterated or misbranded devices in the amount of twice the sale price of any such adulterated or misbranded device. The liquidated damages, if assessed, are limited to a total of $7,000,000 for each calendar year. The authority to assess liquidated damages is in addition to any other remedies otherwise available to the FDA, including civil money penalties.
For additional information regarding the consent decree, refer to the following sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K: Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Other FDA Matters
The company expects that substantially all of its facilities will be inspected by the FDA or other regulatory agencies from time to time. The frequency, duration, scope, findings and consequences of these inspections cannot be predicted.

From time to time, the company may undertake voluntary recalls or field corrective actions of the company's products to correct potential product safety issues that may arise, in furtherance of the company's high standards of quality, safety and effectiveness.
Other Medical Device Regulators
Outside the U.S., it is customary for foreign governments to have a ministry of health or similar government body that regulates and enforces regulations relating to the design, manufacture, distribution and marketing of medical devices. In some cases, there are common standards for design and testing. In some cases, there are country-specific requirements. These regulations are not always harmonized with those from other jurisdictions and in some cases, the consequence in costs, time to enter a market or support a product may be significant.
EEA and UK Regulators
The regulation of the company's products in Europe falls primarily within the United Kingdom (“UK”), Switzerland and the European Economic Area (“EEA”), which consists of the European Union member states, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. Only medical devices that comply with certain conformity requirements of the European Medical Device Regulation (“EMDR”) are allowed to be marketed within the EEA. The company's Class I products were in compliance with EMDR as of May 2021. Products that fail to be certified with the EMDR may not be marketed or sold in the European Union. 

As a result of Brexit, beginning on January 1, 2021, the company's products sold in the UK have been required to be registered with the Medical and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”). Products in conformity with the EMDR and MDD may continue to be marked with their CE marking in the UK until June 2024, after which time products must comply with UK requirements. On May 26, 2021, the EU Commission announced that the Mutual Recognition Agreement between the European Union and Switzerland, which enabled medical devices approved in the European Union to be marketed in Switzerland, was no longer valid. As a result, medical devices must be separately registered with Swissmedic, the Swiss regulatory authority, and the company must comply with Swiss requirements. The regulatory requirements in the UK and Switzerland continue to evolve and the company is monitoring all changes and updates.
In addition, the national health or social security organizations of certain foreign countries, including those outside Europe, require the company's products to be qualified before they can be marketed in those countries.
Other Audit Requirements
Five countries have agreed to work together to harmonize regulations and allow for one single audit to be used to confirm compliance with those countries’ regulations under a program referred to as the Medical Device Single Audit Program, or MDSAP. The five countries that participate include the United States, Canada, Australia, Brazil and Japan. Under the MDSAP, annual surveillance audits of relevant facilities are conducted by a private organization designated by the MDSAP countries referred to as “Notified Body” which assesses conformity with applicable regulations. Under the EMDR and MDD, Notified Bodies have the right to conduct unannounced audits. In addition, the company's facilities in Europe are subject to audits by the applicable medical device regulatory authorities.
Other Quality Accomplishments
In 2022, the company's main facilities in Europe, Asia and North America were again certified as meeting ISO 13485-2016 requirements, a stringent international standard for quality management systems, demonstrating its continued commitment to quality excellence.
National Competitive Bidding
In the United States, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or “CMS”, is a significant payor and governs healthcare reimbursement for Medicare services. From January 2011 through October 2020, CMS conducted its National Competitive Bidding (“NCB”) program to reduce healthcare spending. This program resulted in new, 



Part I 
Item 1. Business

lower Medicare payment rates for medical equipment, which negatively influenced the company’s selling prices. As a result, the company’s revenue, profit, and cash flow were also negatively impacted. 
The company's exposure to effects of NCB rate reductions and any similar reductions from private payors or state agencies can increase the company's credit risk associated with customers whose revenue, based on reimbursement, may be significantly reduced. As reimbursement rates are reduced, the company's customers may experience pressure on profitability and liquidity. The company therefore remains focused on being judicious in its extension of credit to its customers and vigilant about collections efforts.
In addition, the consequence of reduced reimbursement has and may continue to compel customers to consider alternative sources of supply, which may be available at lower purchase prices, thereby reducing sales or the price at which customers will transact for certain products.
Although reductions in CMS payments are disruptive to the homecare industry, the company believes it can grow and thrive in this environment. The company expects to continue pursuing productivity initiatives intended to lower the costs to serve customers, in an effort to profitably meet lower customer price targets. The company also produces certain solutions, which can provide lower total cost of business for its customers. The company intends to continue developing solutions that help providers improve profitability and reduce the overall cost of care for payors including service and support of their end-user customers.
BACKLOG
The company generally manufactures its products to meet near-term demands by shipping from stock or by building to order based on the specialized nature of certain products. As a result, the company does not ordinarily have a substantial backlog of orders for any particular product. However, in 2022, the order backlogs in Europe and North America remained elevated as a result of supply chain constraints which affected access to components and finished products. 
HUMAN CAPITAL
As of December 31, 2022, the company had approximately 2,800 employees. The company believes that its employees are integral to its success and strive to create a rewarding culture through commitment to its core values of Integrity, Innovation, Leadership, Excellence and Accountability. The company's compensation programs are designed to attract, retain and motivate employees to be part of the company's success. The company provides 

wages that are locally competitive and globally consistent to reward employees for performance. The company's long-term incentive program is equity based to align leadership with the interests of shareholders. 
Invacare is committed to its Environmental, Social and Governance program and embraces diversity, equity and inclusion. The company believes that an innovative workforce needs to be diverse, with skills and perspectives drawn from a broad spectrum of backgrounds and experiences. Global and U.S. demographics include:
