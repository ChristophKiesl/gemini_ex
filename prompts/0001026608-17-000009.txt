Compliance with Environmental Laws 
 
The Company believes that it is in compliance with applicable environmental laws. The Company anticipates that no material adverse financial impact will result from compliance with current environmental rules and regulations. On April 7, 2014, the Company sold its Fremont, NC distribution facility for $850,000 in cash. Under the terms of the sales agreement, the Company is responsible for environmental remediation on the property. As a result of studies and estimates prepared by an independent environmental consulting firm, and in conjunction with the sale of the property, the Company recorded a liability of $300,000 in the second quarter of 2014, related to the remediation of the property. The accrual included the total estimated costs of remedial activities and post-remediation operating and maintenance costs. Remediation work on the Fremont project began in the third quarter of 2014 and was completed in 2015. In addition to the remediation work, the Company, with the assistance of its independent environmental consulting firm, must continue to monitor contaminant levels on the property to ensure they comply with governmental standards. The Company expects that the monitoring period will last a period of five years after the completion of the remediation and be complete by the end of 2020.
 
See Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for additional information regarding the cost of remediation and related matters, including ongoing monitoring of contaminant levels.
