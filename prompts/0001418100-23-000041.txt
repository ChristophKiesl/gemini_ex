Item 1. | Business

Our Company 
Avaya is a global leader in communications products, solutions and services for businesses of all sizes, delivering technology predominantly through software and services. We enable organizations worldwide to succeed by creating intelligent communications experiences for their employees and their customers. Avaya is building innovative open, converged contact center ("CC") and unified communications and collaboration ("UCC") software solutions to enhance and simplify communications and collaboration in the cloud, on-premises or as a hybrid of both. We offer hardware and gateway solutions, including devices that enhance collaboration and productivity, and position organizations to incorporate future technological advancements. 
Our experienced team of professionals delivers award-winning services from initial planning and design, to seamless implementation and integration, to ongoing managed operations, optimization and support. We also help clients customize and personalize our software solutions to address their specific needs.
Businesses are built by the experiences they provide, and Avaya solutions deliver millions of those experiences globally every day. With an install base including many of the largest enterprise customers with the most complex needs, Avaya is shaping the future of businesses and workplaces, with innovation and partnerships that power tangible business results. Our communications solutions power tailored, effortless customer and employee experiences that enable our clients to effectively engage and interact with each other and with their customers.
In serving both our existing and new customers across verticals, Avaya is uniquely positioned to meet customers where they are in their digital transformation and journeys to cloud communications, so they can innovate without disruption to gain the benefit of high-value cloud capabilities. We offer a full range of software sales and licensing models that can be deployed on-premises or via a public/multi-tenant cloud, private/dedicated instance cloud or as a hybrid cloud solution. With our open, extensible development platform, customers and third parties can create custom applications and automated workflows for their unique needs and integrate Avaya’s capabilities into the customer's existing infrastructure and business applications. Our solutions enable a seamless communications experience that adapts to how employees work, instead of changing how they work.
Operating Segments
The Company has two operating segments: Products & Solutions and Services.
Products & Solutions
Products & Solutions encompasses our CC and UCC software platforms, applications and devices. During fiscal 2022, we expanded our portfolio to include new cloud-based solutions, and we continued to integrate Artificial Intelligence ("AI") to create enhanced user experiences and improve performance. 
•Contact Center: Avaya’s industry-leading contact center solutions enable clients to build a customized portfolio of applications to drive stronger customer engagement and higher customer lifetime value. Our reliable, secure and scalable communications solutions include voice, email, chat, social media, video, workforce engagement and third-party integration that can improve customer service and help companies compete more effectively. Avaya delivers CCaaS solutions for cloud deployment, and we continue to support enterprises with world-class premises-based solutions and add new value by complementing this highly dependable infrastructure with new capabilities from the cloud. The Avaya Experience Platform™ is our cloud contact center solution that helps organizations deliver immersive, memorable, and personalized customer experiences across all connected touchpoints. It brings together advanced capabilities -- including AI speech analytics and noise removal, attribute-based routing, and automation and self-service -- and brings together teams, resources, and insights to maximize contact center performance and experiences. We continue to integrate AI and automation capabilities into our portfolio, providing our clients a deeper understanding of their customers’ needs with a robust and secure platform.
•Unified Communications: Avaya communications and collaboration solutions support hybrid working environments, empowering teams with fast, always-on continuous collaboration from anywhere. Employees can communicate in context with better access to communication tools and better quality of communications to help deliver greater business impacts.
Avaya multi-tenant cloud-based UCaaS solutions integrate chat, file sharing and task management with real-time collaboration including calling, meetings and content sharing for distributed team productivity. Avaya offers Avaya Cloud Office by RingCentral ("Avaya Cloud Office" or "ACO") in partnership with RingCentral, Inc. ("RingCentral"), giving customers looking to replace outdated or disparate legacy telephony systems with a simple, all-in-one cloud 
communications solution. Our on-premises UC solutions, IP Office for midmarket and Avaya Aura for enterprise, continue to deliver high reliability and functionality that is preferred in a variety of situations.
Services
Complementing our product and solutions portfolio is an award-winning global services portfolio, delivered by Avaya and our extensive partner ecosystem. Within our services portfolio, we utilize a variety of formal survey and customer feedback mechanisms to drive continuous improvement and streamlined process automation, with a focus on constantly increasing our value to customers. Our innovative offerings provide solutions for new clients who want to directly utilize our cloud solutions, support for clients who have the need for hybrid cloud solutions that maximize the value their on-premises systems can deliver, and flexible migration paths for our premises-based customers. This is delivered and supported by:
•Professional Services enable our customers to take full advantage of their IT and communications solution investments to drive measurable business results. Avaya has repositioned its professional services organization to focus on go-forward customer needs. The new Avaya Customer Experience Service ("ACES") brings our depth of experience as our experts partner with customers and guide them along each step of the solution lifecycle to deliver services that add value and drive business transformation — including journey to cloud consulting services. The role of professional services organizations changes in a cloud world, moving from implementations to cloud migration. ACES takes a client-led approach to bring the expertise and practice areas that help clients define the choices and pace for their journey, based on their priorities for experiences and outcomes. Importantly, organizations can bring forward the customizations they have built over the years and add new value with AI and cloud capabilities. Most of our professional services revenue is non-recurring in nature.
•Enterprise Cloud and Managed Services enable customers to take advantage of our technology via the cloud, on-premises solutions or a hybrid of both, depending on the system and the needs of the customer. Avaya focuses on customer performance and growth, encompassing software releases, operating customer cloud, premise or hybrid-based communication systems and helping customers migrate to next-generation business communications environments. Most of our enterprise cloud and managed services revenue in fiscal 2022 was recurring in nature and based on multi-year services contracts.
•Global Support Services help businesses protect their technology investments and address the risk of business-impacting outages. Understanding that agility and high availability are critical to maintain or gain competitive advantage, we facilitate those capabilities through proactive problem prevention, rapid resolution, continual solution optimization, and we increasingly leverage automation to onboard and manage a customer’s communications infrastructure, for faster, more effective deployments from proof of concept to production, and ever-increasing automation. Our subscription offering sets a foundation for continually evolving the customer experience by providing access to future capabilities and solution enhancements. Most of our global support services revenue is recurring in nature.
Through our comprehensive services, we support our customers' ability to fully leverage our technology and maximize their business results. Our solutions drive employee productivity improvements and a differentiated customer experience.
Our services teams help our customers maximize their ability to benefit from Avaya's next-generation communications solutions. Customers can choose the level of support best suited for their needs, aligned with deployment, monitoring, solution management, optimization and more. Our enhanced performance monitoring, coupled with a continuous focus on automation, allows us to quickly identify and remediate issues to avoid business impact.
Deployment Options and Capabilities 
Avaya is transforming to become a leader in communications software and platforms delivered as a service, offering a base set of capabilities on which our clients can build custom and personalized integrations. Cloud and Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) models generally refer to the products and services that allow organizations to move from owning, managing and running 
solutions to paying only for the capabilities they need. Avaya provides an option for customers to access Avaya software and solutions across CC and UCC, and customize as they see fit.
Avaya offers the full spectrum of deployment options, including via private cloud/dedicated instance, multi-tenant public cloud, hybrid cloud, as well as on-premises. This enables organizations to deploy our solutions in the way that best serves their business requirements and complements their existing investments, while moving with the speed and agility they require. 
Avaya Solutions, delivered as a Private, Public, Hybrid or On-Premises Solution
•Private cloud/dedicated instance: Communication services are delivered to customers via its own dedicated instance of the software, which are deployed and operated in hyperscaler environments like Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud for greater scalability and cost-effectiveness.
•Public cloud/multi-tenant: Communications services are delivered to the business via a shared instance of the software on a shared platform.
•Hybrid cloud: Communications capabilities can be added to existing premises-based communications investments, or be consumed from either our dedicated instance or multi-tenant cloud offers. Hybrid solutions can be challenging. Avaya is uniquely positioned to deliver cloud services on top of premises-based solutions, given our deep expertise and successful history of supporting the most complex large enterprise, multinational and government needs globally, allowing our customers to innovate without disruption as they migrate to the cloud on the pace and path that fits their needs.
•On-Premises: While a growing portion of our business is transitioning to our private, public and hybrid cloud deployment models, many customers have business models and/or requirements that mandate a premises-based infrastructure. We will therefore continue to support these solutions via perpetual software licensing and subscription-based models.
Avaya solutions are addressing the convergence of private and public cloud deployments observed across the industry. Used in conjunction with our private/dedicated instance cloud solutions, a customer can take advantage of public cloud capabilities to cost-effectively add value at the edge of their network. Sales of technology through Avaya public cloud solutions are primarily included within the Company's Products segment and sales of technology through the Company's private cloud solutions are primarily recorded within Enterprise Cloud and Managed services in the Company's Services segment. 
Avaya’s investments in data-driven automation mean that if an organization needs to deploy an advanced, integrated, value-focused solution via a private cloud but needs it deployed quickly, Avaya can deliver on the requested timeline. The benefit to the organization is “always available” access to the latest capabilities and innovation, quickly and at scale.
Avaya Subscription Licensing
A subscription licensing model can help customers begin their journey to the cloud by changing from an ownership model for existing on-premises solutions to a usage model with monthly or annual subscription payments. This approach not only provides access to the latest software, it simplifies ordering and payment, as the customer only pays for the software and solutions that they need as opposed to buying an off-the-shelf solution that cannot be easily tailored to their needs. Revenue from the Avaya Subscription offering is primarily included within the Company's Services segment.
Avaya Cloud Migration
We believe our migration methodology differentiates us from many other cloud vendors in the market because our range of solutions and services positions us to meet customers where they are in their digital transformation journey, and innovate without disruption as they migrate to the cloud on the pace and path that fits their needs. Our approach also provides flexible options based on standardized methodologies, enterprise software expertise and a range of services and tools to help organizations along every step of their journey to the cloud, reducing transition complexities and risks.
The comprehensive Avaya portfolio and our development roadmap helps customers take advantage of public, private and hybrid cloud solutions and capabilities that meet their needs at any stage in their transformation journey.
Application Development and Integration
Along with off-the-shelf integration with frequently used business applications across an organization, Avaya’s converged communications platform simplifies the embedding of Avaya Cloud communications and collaboration capabilities into business applications, including customer relationship management and enterprise resources planning. Our open platform and Avaya Communications Application Programming Interfaces ("APIs") enable customers and third parties to work with Avaya to create customized engagement applications and to meet the unique operating requirements of a customer with unified communications and contact center capabilities including voice, video, messaging, meetings and more. Avaya also offers a cloud-based execution and test environment for developing proof-of-concept applications.
The Avaya Client Software Development Kit ("SDK") provides a developer-friendly set of tools that enables the building of innovative user experiences for vertical or business specific applications. Any functionality Avaya uses in its own clients and applications is available to developers through the SDK. Developers can mix and match functionality from both our CC and UCC solutions. All of this is supported by an extensive global partner ecosystem. These partners work with Avaya and our customers to test and certify their solutions to inter-work with Avaya to expand the value our solutions deliver.
Our Business 
Our solutions address the needs of a diverse range of businesses, including large multinational enterprises, small and medium-sized businesses and government organizations. Our customers operate in a broad range of industries, including financial services, healthcare, hospitality, education, government, manufacturing, retail, transportation, energy, media and communications. We employ a flexible go-to-market strategy with direct or indirect presence in approximately 180 countries. As of September 30, 2022, we had more than 3,600 active channel partners and for fiscal 2022 our product revenue from indirect sales through our channel partners represented 65% of our total Products & Solutions segment revenue.
For fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, we generated revenue of $2,490 million, $2,973 million and $2,873 million, of which 31%, 33% and 37% was generated by Products & Solutions and 69%, 67% and 63% by Services, respectively. Revenue by business area is presented in the following table for the periods indicated:

 | Fiscal years ended September 30,
(In millions) | 2022 | | 2021 | | 2020
Products & Solutions: | | | | | 
Contact Center | $ | 248 | | | $ | 309 | | $ | 363 
Unified Communications and Collaboration | 529 | | | 683 | | | 710 
 | 777 | | | 992 | | | 1,073
Services: | | | | | 
Professional Services | 238 | | | 299 | | | 280 
Enterprise Cloud and Managed Services | 249 | | | 281 | | | 282 
Global Support Services | 1,226 | | | 1,401 | | | 1,238
 | 1,713 | | | 1,981 | | | 1,800
 | $ | 2,490 | | | $ | 2,973 | | $ | 2,873

Our software revenue as a percentage of total consolidated revenue represented 64% for both fiscal 2022 and 2021 and 61% of total consolidated revenue for fiscal 2020. Our software revenue aggregates revenue across our two reporting segments. Software revenue includes subscription, public and private cloud, perpetual licenses and related software maintenance revenue. On-premises license revenue is included in Product & Solutions, while subscription and related software maintenance revenues are primarily included in Services.
One of our key focuses is increasing our software and recurring revenue — these include revenues from products and services that are delivered via the cloud, or as either recurring subscription-based software revenue, managed services, global support services, non-recurring perpetual-based software sales or delivered pursuant to multi-period contracts. Other revenues, which are generally non-recurring, consist of professional services and hardware devices, which is a smaller percent of our business, and non-recurring perpetual-based software and one-time professional services. Hardware predominantly consists of endpoints, which include phones, video conferencing equipment and headsets. Professional services include cloud migration and installation services, as well as project-based deployment, design and optimization services. 
Avaya ARR (Annualized Recurring Revenue) provides a leading indicator into the software solutions driving our results. This metric is similar to what our industry peers report and reflects certain recurring components of Avaya's portfolio. Revenues reported as part of Avaya ARR include revenues from: 
•Avaya Subscription
•Avaya Private Cloud
•Avaya CCaaS
•Avaya CPaaS
•Avaya DaaS (Device as a Service)
•Avaya Spaces
•Recurring revenues generated from Avaya Cloud Office
Avaya ARR does not include recurring revenues from Maintenance, Managed Services or Avaya Cloud Office one-time revenues.
In fiscal 2022, ARR was $896 million, compared to $530 million and $191 million reported for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. The growth in ARR is primarily attributable to our customer’s continued migration from on-premise solutions to subscription and cloud based solutions. We believe the ARR, combined with our remaining performance obligations, provides a view into our long-term revenue growth potential and trajectory. 
Trends Shaping Our Industry
We believe several key trends are shaping our industry, creating a substantial opportunity for Avaya and other market participants:
Cloud Growth and Migration:
•Growth in cloud-based technologies continues as businesses focus on digital transformation projects. This expansion of cloud delivery of software applications and management of varied devices in turn leads to an increasing demand for reliability and security.
•Even with the growing contact center market conversion to cloud, on-premises solutions remain a meaningful share of the market, estimated at ~48% in 2026.
•While companies seek innovation, they also want to avoid disruption. The ability to add modular innovation over the top of existing systems can drive significant value, enabling them to transform in a phased approach. This preference for a hybrid approach that mitigates risk favors vendors that have a large install base of customers with dependable technology in place.
•With the increasing overlap between CC and UCC, driven by customer workflows and the need to bring the back office into the frontline of the company, platforms that deliver integrated CCaaS and UCaaS are the foundation of next-generation business communications solutions. A converged, integrated offering for next-generation communications capabilities delivered across a host of mobile devices, and multiple communication and customer service channels bridges what has typically been siloed CC and UCC applications into one powerful tool.
Hybrid/Distributed Workforce:
•A clear priority is the business need to support individuals' expectations for flexible, multi-channel communications and remote and hybrid work styles that have arisen out of the COVID-19 pandemic. The global pandemic altered the way employees and end customers interact and engage, resulting in broad impacts to the ways businesses approach their internal and customer-facing communications planning and platforms.
•Evolving hybrid work environments highlight the need for organizations to ensure consistent collaboration experiences in unpredictable situations, regardless of workers' locations or time zones. Avaya solutions are well positioned to enable this work-from-anywhere approach while maintaining security, reliability and scalability requirements.
•Businesses plan to modify their use of office space to accommodate hybrid and remote work. Modifications will include space reduction, implementing hot-desking and hoteling solutions and equipping shared spaces and meeting rooms for video conferencing with remote participants. Video conferencing and collaboration solutions are an integral part of the changing office environment.
The Rise of Artificial Intelligence:
•Automation through AI solutions is driving improved customer and employee experiences. Conversational AI infused in contact center solutions will improve operational efficiencies and customer experiences, leading to accelerated contact center platform replacements. AI enhancements also improve the meeting and collaboration experience between in-person and remote meeting participants. Video applications are increasingly being infused with virtual assistants, smart transcription and translation and facial recognition.
•Extreme automation is fueling simplicity. Although the enabling technologies in our sector are becoming more complex, their use in contact center applications is driving increased simplicity for organizations and their employees. Simplicity in operations, engagement, customer intelligence and customer experience form the root of the innovation happening in our space.
Growth of the Experience Economy:
•The Experience Economy continues to grow. The Experience Economy is based on the concept that experience is a key source of value — it is a differentiator that creates a competitive advantage for products and services. As 
consumers embrace new technologies and devices in creative ways and at an accelerating pace, Avaya is continuing to invest in AI-powered solutions delivered through cloud and subscription models to create "experiences that matter" for customers, employees and agents. This increased adoption and deployment of AI is providing significant new opportunities for enhanced CC and UCC solutions that improve the customer experience and transform the digital workplace communications and workflows.
Our Market Opportunity
We believe that these trends create significant market opportunities for Avaya next-generation CCaaS, UCaaS and Workstream Collaboration solutions. Avaya offers customers a choice of deployment models including private cloud/dedicated instances, multi-tenant public cloud and premises-based solutions with a broad set of flexible licensing models. Other cloud vendors typically offer only one deployment model - multi-tenant public cloud. Avaya can meet its customers where they are in their cloud journey with a recurring subscription model and/or capabilities added over the top of existing systems. At the same time, we offer new capabilities that bring new value and guide them on a cloud migration path that fits their requirements.
We are pursuing a platform approach that we believe will result in enhanced market opportunity for Avaya, especially when coupled with our strategy to enable our customers to innovate without disruption. We see a significant segment of Avaya customers, particularly in large enterprise and government, that would experience tremendous disruption and risk in leaving behind their customized on-premises platform to fully move to cloud today—whether with Avaya or another vendor. Instead, we believe they prefer to expand their capabilities, rather than by starting anew. We are building solutions that "protect" those key elements of their existing solutions while providing additional functionality delivered via the cloud in a combined, hybrid solution. Most of our competitors cannot match that advantage. We see our ability to improve the user experience and add new value for existing customers while preserving the benefits of their existing systems as a significant driver of retention and growth.
Avaya intends to add further value by exposing APIs for our customers and partners. This enables them to customize and personalize their Avaya platforms, and complete purpose-built integrations with other third-party providers or enterprise systems, to enhance their productivity or improve their employee-to-employee or customer-to-agent interactions. With this, the technology partners in our ecosystem become another major differentiating strength, as they integrate to Avaya communications platforms and add value to our solutions for customers. We believe that the total available market for our solutions includes spending on one-time and recurring communications applications, upgrades and professional and support services to implement, maintain and manage these solutions, along with business devices that improve the application experience.
We are expanding our business in several of these areas, with CCaaS as our North Star. Through our software and subscription offers, we are also growing in the customer segments that we serve, particularly in large enterprises with more than 1,000 employees, as well as in midmarket enterprises with between 50 and 250 agents in the contact center market and between 100 and 1,000 employees using our communications and collaboration solutions. The growth opportunity in these markets comes from the need for enterprises to increase productivity and upgrade their contact center and unified communications and collaboration strategy to a more integrated approach to account for changing customer expectations and the accelerated hybrid work / "work from anywhere" trends, increased mobility, and the demand for seamless experiences across multiple communications channels. In response to these needs, we expect that aggregate total spending on CC, UCC, services and support and enterprise cloud and managed services to grow, with the majority of growth coming from cloud services.
Although the decision makers for our solutions and services have traditionally been senior IT leadership, our research finds that buying decisions are being influenced by business units and the broader C-suite, including Chief Executive Officers ("CEOs"), Chief Marketing Officers ("CMOs") and Chief Digital Officers ("CDOs"). These executive officers have become more involved as digital transformation has expanded beyond the data center and IT infrastructure to encompass lines of business operations and customer experiences. CEOs, CMOs and CDOs are recognizing growing customer and employee demand for better interactions across multiple channels of their choosing, and they see an opportunity to differentiate their companies and lines of business by delivering a superior customer experience. 
We believe that due to the increasing importance of technology as both an internal and external-facing presence of the enterprise, as well as the high stakes of data breaches and similar cyber-security events, CEOs are increasingly engaged in the decision-making process. CMOs and CDOs are gaining additional budget authority as they are tasked with improving customer experience. We believe that because of the shifts in decision-making roles, the focus of customer experience solutions should be to provide businesses with better ways to engage with end users securely across multiple platforms and channels, creating better customer experiences, and ultimately, higher revenues for the business. 
In our experience, decision makers have three critical priorities:
•Leverage existing technology infrastructure while positioning for the future: The speed at which new technology enters the market is challenging for companies to rapidly adopt and deploy. We believe this pressure creates strong 
demand for scalable systems that do not require enterprise-wide overhauls of existing technology to implement newer solutions and technologies. Instead, it favors incremental, flexible, extensible technologies that are easy to adopt and compatible with existing infrastructures.
•Shift to cloud-based solutions: Companies today seek technology that helps them lower Total Cost of Ownership and increase deployment speed and application agility, including a variety of public, private and hybrid cloud solutions. They are also shifting away from a complex, proprietary capital-intensive consumption model to one that is more flexible and efficient in gaining access to the latest technology.
•Manage the reliable and secure integration of an increasing number and variety of devices and endpoints: Today, business users leverage laptops, smartphones and tablets just as often as – if not more often than – desk-based devices. The ability to communicate seamlessly and securely across devices, applications and endpoints must be managed as part of an integrated communications infrastructure.
Customers are also looking for faster proof points, whether that is in the context of limited trials or pilots, and they want to innovate quickly to learn fast from what went well and what did not, and incorporate those learnings. 
Our Strategy
We believe we have positioned Avaya as a leader in cloud-based communications solutions by:
•Defining innovation in our core market segments by partnering and delivering powerful AI-enabled cloud communications solutions, with CCaaS clearly established as our North Star.
•Winning with global services capabilities that support customer cloud adoption and drive expansion.
•Activating, converting and transforming our installed base, enabling them to innovate without disruption. We will help our enterprise customers add new value by deploying cloud capabilities over the top of their existing premises-based solutions, on a pace and path that meets their unique needs.
In addition, Avaya intends to:
•Expand Sales within Existing Customers and Pursue New Customers: We have a significant opportunity to increase sales to our existing customers with our platform approach and strategy to enable them to add new cloud capabilities and migrate without disruption. Our market leadership, global scale and extensive customer interaction, including at the C-suite level, supports our Avaya portfolio, creating a strong software platform from which to drive and shape the evolution of enterprise communications. We have strong credibility with our customers, which provides us with a competitive edge as our customers make the transition to the cloud. Additionally, our CCaaS solutions and Avaya Cloud Office increase the potential for acquiring new customers.
Our solutions are both HIPAA and PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) compliant as we believe the ability to service the healthcare and pharmaceuticals industries, as well as merchants that accept credit cards, significantly expands our potential customer base and total addressable market. These certifications allow for market penetration into what are otherwise restrictive and difficult markets.
•Re-align and simplify Avaya go-to-market, and support structures: We will streamline our operating structure internally to align with the products and services that will deliver the greatest value to our customers — and therefore to our partner ecosystem and to Avaya. 
•Increase our Midmarket Capabilities and Market Share: We believe our market opportunity for the portion of the midmarket segment that Avaya serves is growing. We define the midmarket as firms with between 50 and 250 agents for CC and between 100 and 1,000 employees for UCC. Not only do we believe this segment is growing, but we also believe midmarket businesses are underserved and willing to invest in IT enhancements. We intend to continue to invest in our midmarket offerings and go-to-market resources to increase market share and meet the growing demands of this segment.
•Adjust Sales and Distribution Capabilities to Customer Needs: Our flexible go-to-market strategy consists of both a direct sales force and an indirect sales force through our alliances and channel partners, which enables us to reach customers across industries and around the globe. We believe our channel partner network is a valuable competitive differentiator based on our brand and long history of fostering a robust channel sales go-to-market motion. We intend to continue to align our channel partners and sales forces to optimize their market focus and better serve vertical segments. We provide our channel partners, including Technology Service Distributors (TSDs) and sales agents, with training, marketing programs and technical support that helps to further differentiate our offerings from those of our competitors. These agents are our primary distribution channel for small to midmarket customers. Under our Technology Service Distributor program, small to midmarket sales agents connect prospective customers with our 
direct sales force. The Avaya team then handles the transaction from contracting and partnering with the customer to determine what services are appropriate to ultimately managing and billing the customer for the Avaya services provided. The Technology Service Distributor program provides an option that rounds out the available choices for customers, channel partners and sales agents to access Avaya’s industry-leading communications solutions.
We also leverage our sales and distribution channels to accelerate customer adoption of our cloud-based solutions and generate an increasing percentage of our revenue from our high-value software solutions, video collaboration, mid-market offerings and user experience applications.
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe the following competitive strengths position us to capitalize on the opportunities created by the market trends affecting our industry as Avaya continues to transform as a software and services company.
A Leading Position and Install Base across our Primary Markets
With a full suite of CC and UCC solutions offered and our expansive go-to-market capability, we are a global leader in business communications. We maintain a leading market share in worldwide contact center agents and are recognized by industry analysts as being among the leaders in unified communications and collaboration seats. Additionally, we believe we are a leading provider of private/dedicated instance cloud and managed services and that our market leadership and incumbent position within our customer base provides us with a superior opportunity to cross-sell to existing customers and position ourselves to win over new customers. With our platform approach and strategy to migrate our customers without disruption, we create drivers for customer retention and growth within this industry-leading installed base. The ability to add capabilities over the top of existing infrastructure for our existing customers puts us in a position where we have virtually no meaningful competition in migrating these customers.
Our Open Standards Technology Supports Multi-vendor, Multi-platform Environments
At Avaya, our open architecture and standards-based technology enable us to accommodate existing and new customers with multi-vendor environments seeking to leverage existing investments while achieving immediate overall costs savings and improved functionality. Providing enterprises with strong integration capabilities positions them to take advantage of new UCC and CC technology as it is introduced. Our software technology does not limit customers to a single vendor or add to the backlog of integration work. In fact, our extensive partner ecosystem, together with our open communications APIs — a set of routines, protocols and tools for building software applications and applications development environments — enable our customers to derive additional and unique value from our architecture.
Building on our Leading Service Capabilities for a Significant Recurring Revenue Stream
Avaya's services relationships have long been significant contributors to our recurring revenue base and provide substantial visibility into our customers' future collaboration needs. Our enterprise cloud and managed services and support services use a standardized approach with a global methodology and business process management for delivery and support. Typically, we provide this to our customers through recurring contracts ranging from one to five years.
In addition to insights into their ongoing operational needs, our professional services team provides customers with a path to the cloud from premise-based solutions by engaging in migration planning, security services, custom application integration and other consulting activities that position us to understand our customers’ business needs today and in the future.
Research and Development ("R&D")
Avaya makes substantial investments in R&D to develop new systems, solutions and software in support of business communications, including, but not limited to, converged communications systems, communications applications, multimedia contact center innovations, collaboration tools, video, speech-enabled applications, cloud offerings, web services, artificial intelligence and services for our customers. We are investing in converged cloud technology platforms that are API-first and elastic — scaling down to profitably support small and medium business segments and scaling up to support large-scale requirements of our largest enterprise customers. This platform approach means a consolidated code base that will speed innovation and our delivery of feature enhancements exponentially.
Over the past three fiscal years, we have invested approximately $660 million in R&D, including technology acquisitions, reflecting a consistent investment in R&D as a percentage of product revenue and evidencing our commitment to innovation. Our investments in fiscal 2022 focused on driving innovative cloud solutions across our portfolio and new releases of our CC and UCC solutions.
Patents, Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property
We own a significant number of patents important to our business and we expect to continue to file patent applications to protect our R&D investments in new products and services across all areas of our business. As of September 30, 2022, we had 
more than 4,300 patents and pending patent applications, including foreign counterpart patents and foreign applications. These patents and pending patent applications cover a wide range of products and services involving a variety of technologies. For the United States, patent terms may be 20 years from the date of the patent's filing, depending upon term adjustments made by the patent office. In addition, we hold numerous trademarks in the United States and in other countries. We also have licenses to intellectual property for the manufacture, use and sale of our products.
We obtain patent and other intellectual property rights used in connection with our business when practicable and appropriate. Historically, we have done so both organically, through commercial relationships, and in connection with acquisitions.
We manage our patent portfolio to maximize return on investment by selectively selling patents at market prices and cross-licensing with other parties when such sales or licensing are in best our interests. These monetization programs are conducted in a manner that helps to preserve Avaya’s freedom to operate and to help ensure that Avaya retains patents needed for defensive use.
From time to time, assertions of infringement of certain patents or other intellectual property rights of others have been made against us, and certain pending claims are in various stages of litigation. Based on our experience and customary industry practice, we believe that any licenses or other rights that might be necessary for us to continue with our current business could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. For more information concerning the risks related to patents, trademarks and other intellectual property, see Item 1A, "Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-Intellectual Property and Information Security-We may be subject to litigation and infringement claims, which could cause us to incur significant expenses or prevent us from selling our products or services."
Customers
Avaya employs a flexible, go-to-market strategy to support our diverse customer base. Our customers range in size from small businesses employing a few individuals to large government agencies and multinational companies with tens or hundreds of thousands of employees. Our customers operate in a broad range of industries, including financial services, manufacturing, retail, transportation, energy, media and communications, hospitality, health care, education and government. Our customers include leading Forbes Global 2000 companies across all these industries. Customers continue to trust Avaya and lean into our approach of enabling them to innovate without disruption.

Sales and Distribution
Our customer-centric, cloud-first, global go-to-market strategy serves to focus and strengthen our reach and impact on large multinational enterprises, midmarket and regional enterprises and small businesses. Our sales organizations are equipped to sell our comprehensive portfolio, complemented by services offerings including professional services, product support, integration and other services so we can engage our customers in the way they prefer to work with us, either directly with Avaya or indirectly through our sales channels.
We continue to focus on efficient deployment of Avaya sales resources, both directly and indirectly through our channel partners, for maximum market penetration and global growth. Our investment in our sales organization includes fully integrated curricula on the sales process, guided selling, sales enablement and on our solutions for all roles within our sales organization.
Our Global Partner and Alliance Ecosystem 
Avaya fosters relationships with an expansive set of partners that we believe deliver business-impacting value for each company, for Avaya, and most importantly, for the customers we serve together. We have built a global network of traditional channel partners, cloud system integrators, technology solutions distributors, sales agents and other service providers to fill any customer need:
•Channel Partners: Our channel partners serve our customers worldwide through our Avaya Edge business partner program. Through certifications, the Avaya Edge program positions Value Added Reseller partners to sell, implement and maintain our communications systems, applications and services. Note, the largest Avaya distributor, ScanSource Inc., is also its largest customer and represented 8% of the Company's total consolidated revenue for fiscal 2022. See Item 1A, "Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-Our Operations, Markets and Competition-We depend on our indirect sales channel" for additional information on the Company's reliance on its indirect sales channel.
•Technology Service Distributor (TSD) and Agent Channel: Another active channel that has expanded Avaya’s indirect reach: the TSD and Agent channel. TSDs operate like a traditional distributor in that they connect and represent vendors to an enormous channel of agents. TSDs provide training, assist with solution selection and function as a resource, but unlike traditional distributors, TSDs primarily focus on cloud services. The primary focus of an agent is working with customers to define a solution and connecting the customers with vendors. An agent often 
operates as a consultant or expert on behalf of its customer. The TSD and Agent channel is most prevalent in the US and Canada, with an expanding presence in Western Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. 
•Global Service Provider alliances: Through these partnering arrangements with leading telecommunications service providers, we pursue sell-to and sell-through opportunities for Avaya solutions and services. These alliances are integral in selling and implementing our cloud-based services and are principal routes to market for our CCaaS and UCaaS solutions. 
•Global Systems Integrator alliances: These refer to arrangements with systems integrator partners, as well as key channel partners with strong professional services and personalized integration capabilities who include Avaya solutions within broader digital transformation programs and end-to-end vertical solutions.
•Ecosystem alliances: These partnering arrangements are with industry leaders and leading technology companies. They feature deeper, R&D-led integrations and/or expanded go-to-market efforts, including new routes to market through Avaya's participation in third-party marketplaces such as Salesforce App Exchange or the Microsoft Azure Marketplace. We have also developed closer partnerships with hyperscalers such as Microsoft, Google and Amazon.
During fiscal 2022, we expanded our partnership with Microsoft with an increased commitment to the development of Azure-based cloud solutions including Private Cloud CC and UC offers and delivered CCaaS capabilities from within Microsoft Dynamics 365. We further attained Microsoft IP Co-Sell Incentivized status for our existing CCaaS offer, strengthening the value of Avaya with Microsoft Sales and Sellers in joint go-to-market activities. Avaya has also been working with Salesforce to build joint go-to-market momentum with Avaya for Salesforce, a recently commercialized Salesforce Service Cloud Voice offer. Finally, Avaya and Google continue to drive more cloud adoption and scale Contact Center AI capabilities. The next-generation Avaya Media Processing Platform was also delivered as a native, cloud-first solution, containerized and orchestrated with microservices through Google Cloud Platform.
In addition, during fiscal 2022 we established a new relationship with Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise (ALE), expanding our customer reach for CCaaS through ALE sales efforts, while simultaneously broadening the Avaya portfolio to include the ALE suite of networking solutions. We also built on our strategic partnership with RingCentral for Avaya Cloud Office, our UCaaS solution, adding new capabilities and expanding into new markets. 
In 2022, we expanded our go-to-market reach for Avaya solutions via cloud provider and SaaS marketplaces, including Salesforce App Exchange and the Microsoft Azure Marketplace. We also achieved Microsoft IP Co-Sell Incentivized status for our CCaaS solution. The Avaya DevConnect program is designed to promote the development, compliance-testing and co-marketing of innovative third-party products that are compatible with Avaya’s standards-based products. Member organizations have expertise in a broad range of technologies, including IP telephony, CC and UCC applications.
Manufacturing and Suppliers
We have outsourced substantially all of our manufacturing operations to several contract manufacturers. All manufacturing of our products is performed in accordance with detailed specifications and product designs, furnished or approved by Avaya, and is subject to rigorous quality control standards. We periodically review our product manufacturing operations and consider changes we believe may be necessary or appropriate. We also purchase certain hardware components and license certain software components from third-party Original Equipment Manufacturers, which we then resell separately or as part of our products under the Avaya brand.
In some cases, certain components are available only from a single source or from a limited number of suppliers. Delays or shortages associated with these components could cause significant disruption to our operations, although we have not yet had any such event have a material impact on us. For more information on risks related to products, components and logistics, see Item 1A, "Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-Our Operations, Markets and Competition-We rely on third-party contract manufacturers, component suppliers and partners (some of which are sole source and limited source suppliers) and warehousing and distribution logistics providers. If these relationships are disrupted and we are unable to obtain substitute manufacturers, suppliers or partners, on favorable terms or at all, our business, operating results and financial condition may be harmed."
Competition
Although we believe we are differentiated from any single competitor, competition will continue to evolve and grow. Proper execution of our strategy will force them to change their selling tactics to compete effectively. The following represent the Company's primary competitors in various lines of our business:
•UCC premise and cloud: Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise, Atos Unify, Cisco, 8x8, GoTo, Huawei, Microsoft, Mitel, NEC, RingCentral and Zoom.
•CC premise and cloud: Amazon, Cisco, Content Guru, Dialpad, Enghouse Interactive, Five9, Genesys, LiveVox, NICE inContact, Talkdesk and Twilio.
•Video Products and Conferencing Solutions premise and cloud: Cisco, Google, Huawei, Lifesize, GoTo, Microsoft, Poly, RingCentral, Yealink and Zoom.
We also face competition in certain geographies in which we operate with companies that have a particular strength and focus in those regions. 
While we believe our global, in-house end-to-end services organization as well as our indirect channel provide us with a competitive advantage, we face competition from companies offering products and services directly or indirectly through their channel partners, as well as resellers, consulting and systems integration firms and network service providers.
For more information on risks related to our competition, see Item 1A, "Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-Our Operations, Markets and Competition-We face formidable competition from providers of unified communications and contact center solutions and services, including cloud-based solutions, and this competition may negatively impact our business and limit our growth."
Employee and Human Capital Management
Our Global Footprint
Our ability to attract, retain and engage diverse talent is critical to the successful execution of our strategy and delivering on our mission to create experiences that matter for our customers and employees. Our cultural principles of Simplicity, Trust, Accountability, Teamwork, Empowerment and Inclusion have been foundational to our culture and serve as the framework for each phase of the employee life cycle.
As of September 30, 2022, we employed 7,090 employees, of which 34% were located in North America (United States and Canada), 26% were located in Asia Pacific, 8% were located in the Caribbean and Latin America and 32% were located in Europe, Middle East and Africa. In addition, 22% of our global employee headcount identified as female. In the United States, 27% of the employee headcount identified as female and 26% of our employees self-identified as a minority group. On September 6, 2022, we announced a reduction in force to realize annual cost reductions, together with other unrelated incremental cost reduction actions, to better align the Company’s workforce with its operational strategy and cost structure. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we completed a reduction in force of 766 employees, approximately 10% of our global workforce, and we recognized $26 million of related restructuring expense. The Company made, and expects to make, additional reductions in workforce during fiscal 2023 as it continues to align the business with its operational strategy and cost structure.
Of our 2,077 employees located in the United States, 13% are represented by a labor union. In many countries outside of the US, our employees are represented by trade unions, work councils or collective bargaining agreements at the national level.
At Avaya, we champion an open, fair and supportive environment where our employees can thrive both professionally and personally. We work hard, give back to our communities, take care of our customers and promote high levels of employee engagement and well-being. Human capital management and environmental, social and governance ("ESG") matters are woven into the everyday fabric of Avaya's culture and actively sponsored by our executive leadership. In addition, aspects of human capital management and ESG are overseen by our Board of Directors as well as the Compensation Committee, Audit Committee and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. 
Fostering a Destination Place to Work
Our people strategy enables a culture that empowers our team members to leverage their strengths and experiences and also provides development and growth opportunities to sustain and expand our world-class services and cultivate innovation. This strategy is reflected in Avaya's goal to become a destination place to work, retain our top performers and attract high-caliber new talent into the organization. Underpinned by our cultural principles, our global population demonstrates the following attributes in the way we work and in everything we do:
•We espouse a customer-centric approach to focus on making our customers' lives simpler and more efficient.
•We foster a safe environment where innovative solutions are encouraged and rewarded.
•We encourage our people to speak up, take responsibility and embrace ownership.
•We lead by example and function as a transparent and dynamic team working towards a unified vision.
•We recognize one another for our achievements and strengths and value diversity of thought and the uniqueness of everyone in a collaborative environment.
•We empower our people to take risks, immerse themselves in the experience and drive customer success.
Employee Engagement
We enhance employee engagement by soliciting and addressing feedback, investing in our employees and promoting diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging.
We regularly conduct employee surveys to better understand and improve perceptions in the areas of engagement, recognition, career development, inclusion, leadership and management effectiveness and ethics and integrity. 71% of our employees participated in our most recent survey in 2022 and responses indicated employee engagement of 76%. We use the feedback to identify opportunities and take action to continually strengthen our culture and enhance engagement, as we strive to make Avaya a destination place to work. For the third consecutive year, Avaya was recognized by Forbes as one of the World's Best Employers in 2022.
At Avaya, we are acutely aware that developing our talent is both critical for continuing success in a rapidly evolving industry as well as for employee retention. We invest significant resources in professional development, career advancement and training for our global employee population. In addition to ongoing performance reviews and development discussions that occur as part of our formalized annual performance lifecycle, consistent, meaningful conversations are encouraged between employees and managers to continue the dialogue regarding aspirations, goals and career growth. 
Avaya continues to invest in tools, resources, partnerships and programs to further develop our internal capabilities to develop talent and build a leadership pipeline to support our business success in 2022. In addition to hosting leadership development programs with partners such as BetterUp and ZengerFolkman, Avaya developed and launched two new leadership development programs in 2022; Stepping Into Leadership for new leaders and Accelerate! for high-potential early career employees. All employees have access to learning tools and programs such as LinkedIn Learning and Mentoring. Over 80% of employees have activated their LinkedIn Learning accounts. Avaya also hosted its first employee learning week, Spark Week, with over 1,700 employees participating in a variety of virtual sessions ranging in topics from business acumen to health and well-being.
Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging (DEI&B) at Avaya
At Avaya, we drive and promote a clear strategy to build a workplace that mirrors the society in which we do business — a workplace where individuality is celebrated and harnessed to create a culture of engagement, innovation, inclusivity and belonging.
To successfully execute on our strategy, we have established a Global DEI&B Council, chaired by our CEO, to ensure alignment between our DEI&B strategy and our overall business strategy and a Global DEI&B Committee, chaired by our Chief Human Resources Officer, to ensure global calibration and oversee the execution of various DEI&B initiatives. We continue to partner with Blue Ocean Brain to promote diversity awareness and education for our employees.
Our Employee Resource Groups ("ERGs"), employee-led groups that bring employees together to foster a sense of belonging, have increased to seven active ERGs: Avaya Blacks Leading Empowerment (ABLE), Abilities Employee Resource Group (AERG), Asociacion Latinos Mundiales Avaya (ALMA), Asian Pacific Islanders @ Avaya (API@A), PRIDE @ Avaya, Veterans @ Avaya (VET@A) and Women's Inspired Network @ Avaya (WIN@A). ERG representatives serve on the Global DEI&B Committee to discuss insights, recommendations and initiatives with leadership. 
We focus on ensuring our hiring pipeline is accessible, dynamic and that we draw from a diverse pool of talent. To further these objectives, we utilize tools to support 'blind sourcing', conduct on-going training of our talent acquisition teams around topics such as unconscious bias, micro aggressions and inequities, and provide hiring managers toolkits to engage and attract diverse talent networks.
Employee Benefits
We provide comprehensive health insurance plans that include medical, dental and vision for our employees and their families in most countries. Our global employee population has access to employee assistance and wellness programs, including those covering financial wellness.
Corporate Responsibility
At Avaya, we believe it is our responsibility to help make the world a better place, and together with our employees, communities, customers, suppliers and community partners, we are working to make that a reality. Avaya embeds corporate responsibility into our day-to-day business, from our product design to supply chain management and employee giving. We pride ourselves on leveraging sustainability to drive innovation and develop new products, processes, services and technologies that contribute to the development and well-being of human needs and institutions while also respecting the world's natural resources. Remaining steadfast in our commitment to combat climate change, Avaya exceeded its 2020 target by reducing Scope 1 & Scope 2 emissions by 65% and Scope 3 emissions from business travel by 49% from 2014 levels. From fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2021, we reduced our total emissions by 1%. Building on our achievements and continuing the momentum, in fiscal 2022, we committed to set near-term company-wide emissions reduction targets in line with climate science. Additional detail 
on our environmental, social and governance initiatives, including with respect to human capital, climate change and charitable giving, are included in our Corporate Responsibility Report and on our website.1
Environmental, Health and Safety Matters
Avaya is subject to a wide range of governmental requirements relating to safety, health and environmental protection, including:
•certain provisions of environmental laws governing the cleanup of soil and groundwater contamination;
•various local, federal and international laws and regulations regarding the material content and design of our products;
•various local, federal and international laws that require us to be financially responsible for the collection, treatment, recycling and disposal of those products; and
•various employee safety and health regulations that are imposed in various countries within which we operate. 
We are responsible for conducting remediation at four currently or formerly owned or leased sites. We do not believe this work will have a material impact on our business, results of operations or liquidity.
Cybersecurity
Avaya has a vigorous, risk-based cybersecurity program, dedicated to protecting our data as well as data belonging to our customers and partners. We utilize a defensive in-depth strategy, with multiple layers of security controls to protect our data and solutions. Organizationally, we have a Product Security Council, cross-functional Cyber Incident Response teams, Security Operations Centers, and strong governance to ensure compliance with our security policies and protocols. These teams are comprised of experts across our enterprise, as well as outside experts, to ensure that we are monitoring the effectiveness of our cybersecurity governance and vulnerability management programs.
