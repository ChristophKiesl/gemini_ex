Corporate History

TurnKey Capital, Inc. (the Company, we, our, or us) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada under the name of Vanell, Corp. on September 7, 2012 (Inception). The Company changed its name to Train Travel Holdings, Inc. on March 20, 2014 and to TurnKey Capital, Inc. on January 15, 2016 as a result of changes in its line of business.

We are a shell company as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). Our wholly owned subsidiaries are Remote Office Management, Inc. (ROM), which was formed in 2016 and is discussed below, and Turnkey Home Buyers USA, Inc., which was formed in 2014 and was inactive in 2019 and 2018. The Company does not have any paid employees; however, the officers and directors continue to work to further the Companys business objectives.

Recent Developments

Egg Health Hub, Inc.

On September 13, 2019, we entered into a Definitive Acquisition Agreement (the Egg Agreement) with Egg Health Hub, Inc. (Egg). Pursuant to the Egg Agreement, Egg and the Company agreed to commence the negotiation and preparation of a definitive share exchange agreement (the Share Exchange Agreement) pursuant to which Egg will exchange all of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock for shares of the Companys common stock on a one-for-one basis (the Exchange), which upon the closing of the Exchange will constitute 70,000,000 shares of Eggs issued and outstanding common stock. In order to consummate the Exchange, the parties must first enter into the Share Exchange Agreement. Assuming that the parties enter into the Share Exchange Agreement and the Exchange is effected, following the closing of the Exchange, Egg will become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The Exchange is expected to close in the second quarter of 2020. Egg is a related party, has no employees, and does not currently conduct operations.

Egg is a brand new model for healthcare and wellness that brings together top physicians and wellness professionals into co-practicing communities with shared access to a full-stack technology platform  scheduling, billing, client acquisition, and telemedicine  and flexible access to beautiful office space designed to optimize both the physician and client experience. This model creates a compelling new option for re-tenanting traditional shopping centers and mixed-use space that landlords see as a true traffic generator. 

Reverse Stock Split

The Company effected a 1-for-100 reverse stock split (the Reverse Split) of the Companys issued and outstanding shares of common stock. On September 13, 2019 following the Reverse Split, the Company had 422,699 shares of common stock issued and outstanding.

ROM Business

ROM was formed to market bundled accounting and computer/information technology (IT) services. Simultaneously, ROM entered into a professional services agreement with R3 Accounting, (an accounting firm owned by Timothy Hart, a director, secretary and CFO of the Company) (R3 Accounting), and PC Lauderdale (an unrelated computer/IT company). The purpose of the agreement was to form a joint venture whereby these entities would cross-market professional services under ROM for one stop computer/IT and accounting services. ROM was inactive during 2019 and did not generate any revenue. Through ROM, we generated revenues of $60,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018 from accounting services. These services were provided to MediXall Group, Inc. (MediXall). MediXall is a publicly reporting company. Each of Mr. Swartz, our President, CEO and director, and Mr. Hart, our CFO and director, is a significant stockholder of MediXall. Mr. Swartz is MediXalls Interim CEO and Chairman of the Board, and Mr. Hart is MediXalls CFO and a member of MediXalls board of directors. In addition, TBG Holdings, Inc. (TBG) is a significant stockholder of MediXall. Messrs. Swartz and Hart are both officers and major shareholders of TBG. As such, they may be deemed to be beneficial holders of the MediXall shares held by TBG.

Risks and Challenges

Limited Operating History. The Company was established on September 7, 2012 and has been attempting to develop unrelated businesses. We have had no operating history upon which an investor may rely. Potential investors should be aware of the difficulties the Company is likely to encounter in view of the fact that it has not yet commenced operations, including, but not limited to, competition and unanticipated costs and expenses. There can be no assurance that the Company will successfully implement its new business or other business plans.
We Need Additional Capital To Fund Our Planned Operations. The Company does not have cash reserves available to meet its basic operational requirements and will be dependent upon the sale of its common stock and/or other financing to fund potential acquisitions, as well as covering our basic overhead expenses. We expect to fund our general operations for the next 6 - 12 months with the private sale of our common stock or from funding provided by TBG. There is no assurance we can raise the capital we need or that a financing will be at terms satisfactory to us. We currently have no commitment for financing.
