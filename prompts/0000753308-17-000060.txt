Item 1. Business
OVERVIEW
NEE is one of the largest electric power companies in North America and, through its subsidiary NEER and its affiliated entities, is the largest generator of renewable energy from the wind and sun in the world based on 2016 MWh produced. NEE also owns and/or operates generation, transmission and distribution facilities to support its services to retail and wholesale customers, and has investments in gas infrastructure assets. NEE also provides risk management services related to power and gas consumption related to its own generation assets and for a limited number of wholesale customers in selected markets. NEE's business strategy has emphasized the development, acquisition and operation of renewable, nuclear and natural gas-fired generation facilities in response to long-term federal policy trends supportive of zero and low air emissions sources of power. As of December 31, 2016, NEE's business included the following:

• | approximately 45,900 MW of generating capacity with electric generation facilities located in 30 states in the U.S., 4 provinces in Canada and in Spain;


• | approximately 16% of the installed base of U.S. wind power production capacity;


• | approximately 11% of the installed base of U.S. universal solar power production capacity;


• | one of the largest fleets of nuclear power stations in the U.S., with 8 reactors at 5 sites located in 4 states, representing approximately 6% of U.S. nuclear power electric generating capacity;


• | a generation fleet with significantly lower rates of emissions of CO2, SO2 and NOx than the average rates of the U.S. electric power industry with approximately 98% of its 2016 generation, measured by MWh produced, coming from renewable, nuclear and natural gas-fired facilities;


• | approximately 800 substations and 76,700 miles of transmission and distribution lines;


• | more than 5.4 million retail and wholesale electric customer accounts; and


• | approximately 14,700 people employed, primarily in the U.S.

NEE was incorporated in 1984 under the laws of Florida and conducts its operations principally through two wholly owned subsidiaries, FPL and NEER. NEECH, another wholly owned subsidiary of NEE, owns and provides funding for NEER's and NEE's operating subsidiaries, other than FPL and its subsidiaries. During 2014, NEE formed NEP to acquire, manage and own contracted clean energy projects with stable, long-term cash flows. See NEER section below for further discussion of NEP. When discussed in this combined Form 10-K, NEE's and NEER's generating capacity as of December 31, 2016 includes approximately 971 MW associated with noncontrolling interests related to NEP.
NEE's two principal businesses, FPL and NEER, also constitute NEE's reportable segments for financial reporting purposes. See Note 14 for certain financial information about these segments. NEE seeks to create value in its two principal businesses by meeting its customers' needs more economically and more reliably than its competitors, as described in more detail in the following sections. NEE's strategy has resulted in profitable growth over sustained periods at both FPL and NEER. Management seeks to grow each business in a manner consistent with the varying opportunities available to it; however, management believes that the diversification and balance represented by FPL and NEER is a valuable characteristic of the enterprise and recognizes that each business contributes to NEE's credit profile in different ways. FPL and NEER, as well as other NEE subsidiaries, share common support functions with the objective of lowering costs and creating efficiencies for their businesses. NEE and its subsidiaries continue to develop and implement enterprise wide initiatives focused mainly on improving productivity and reducing O&M expenses (cost savings initiatives).
In July 2016, NEE announced a proposed merger (EFH merger) under which a newly formed subsidiary of NEE will acquire 100% of the equity of reorganized Energy Future Holdings Corp. (reorganized EFH) and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries, including its indirect ownership of approximately 80% of the outstanding equity interests of Oncor Electric Delivery Company LLC 
4

(Oncor), a regulated electric distribution and transmission business that operates the largest distribution and transmission system in Texas. The merger agreement (EFH merger agreement) provides that the consideration for the transaction funded by NEE will be $9.796 billion, which will be paid almost all in cash, with the balance in shares of NEE common stock. The amount of consideration will be subject to adjustment as provided in the EFH merger agreement. In late October 2016, additional agreements were entered into with other parties that, when combined with the EFH merger agreement, if completed, would result in NEE owning 100% of Oncor. The aggregate consideration to be paid by NEE under these additional agreements will be approximately $2.4 billion and will be subject to adjustment as provided in the additional agreements. On February 17, 2017, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware confirmed Energy Future Holdings Corp.'s Eighth Amended Joint Plan of Reorganization. Completion and actual closing dates of the EFH merger and the other Oncor-related transactions remain subject to, among other things, approval by the PUCT and receipt of a supplemental private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The PUCT hearings regarding the merger transactions were conducted the week of February 20, 2017. NEE, EFH and the other parties to the EFH merger agreement, and the parties to the other Oncor-related transaction agreements, have certain specified termination rights. NEE expects the EFH merger and the other Oncor-related transactions to be completed in the first half of 2017. See Note 7 - Pending Oncor-Related Transactions. 
In January 2017, a subsidiary of NEE completed the sale of its fiber-optic telecommunications business (FPL FiberNet) for net cash proceeds of approximately $1.1 billion, after repayment of $370 million of related long-term debt. See Note 1 - Assets and Liabilities Associated with Assets Held for Sale.
FPL
FPL was incorporated under the laws of Florida in 1925 and is a rate-regulated electric utility engaged primarily in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electric energy in Florida. FPL is the largest electric utility in the state of Florida and one of the largest electric utilities in the U.S. based on retail MWh sales. At December 31, 2016, FPL had approximately 26,000 MW of net generating capacity, 74,800 miles of transmission and distribution lines and 600 substations. FPL provides service to its customers through an integrated transmission and distribution system that links its generation facilities to its customers. At December 31, 2016, FPL served approximately 10 million people through approximately 4.9 million customer accounts. FPL's service territory, which covers most of the east and lower west coasts of Florida, and plant locations as of December 31, 2016 were as follows (see Sources of Generation below):
5

CUSTOMERS AND REVENUE
FPL's primary source of operating revenues is from its retail customer base; it also serves a limited number of wholesale customers within Florida. The percentage of FPL's operating revenues and customer accounts by customer class were as follows:
For both retail and wholesale customers, the prices (or rates) that FPL may charge are approved by regulatory bodies, by the FPSC in the case of retail customers, and by the FERC in the case of wholesale customers. In general, under U.S. and Florida law, regulated rates are intended to cover the cost of providing service, including a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. Since the regulatory bodies have authority to determine the relevant cost of providing service and the appropriate rate of return on capital employed, there can be no guarantee that FPL will be able to earn any particular rate of return or recover all of its costs through regulated rates. See FPL Regulation below.
FPL seeks to maintain attractive rates for its customers. Since rates are largely cost-based, maintaining low rates requires a strategy focused on developing and maintaining a low-cost position, including the implementation of ideas generated from the cost savings initiatives discussed above. A common benchmark used in the electric power industry for comparing rates across companies is the price of 1,000 kWh of consumption per month for a residential customer. FPL's 2016 average bill for 1,000 kWh of monthly residential usage was the lowest among reporting electric utilities within Florida and well below the July 2016 national average (the latest date for which this data is available) as indicated below:
6

FRANCHISE AGREEMENTS AND COMPETITION
FPL's service to its retail customers is provided primarily under franchise agreements negotiated with municipalities or counties. During the term of a franchise agreement, which is typically 30 years, the municipality or county agrees not to form its own utility, and FPL has the right to offer electric service to residents. FPL currently holds 180 franchise agreements with various municipalities and counties in Florida with varying expiration dates through 2046. These franchise agreements cover approximately 88% of FPL's retail customer base in Florida. FPL also provides service to 13 other municipalities and to 21 unincorporated areas within its service area without franchise agreements pursuant to the general obligation to serve as a public utility. FPL relies upon Florida law for access to public rights of way.
Because any customer may elect to provide his/her own electric services, FPL effectively must compete for an individual customer's business. As a practical matter, few customers provide their own service at the present time since FPL's cost of service is lower than the cost of self-generation for the vast majority of customers. Changing technology, economic conditions and other factors could alter the favorable relative cost position that FPL currently enjoys; however, FPL seeks as a matter of strategy to ensure that it delivers superior value, in the form of high reliability, low bills and excellent customer service. 
In addition to self-generation by residential, commercial and industrial customers, FPL also faces competition from other suppliers of electrical energy to wholesale customers and from alternative energy sources. In each of 2016, 2015 and 2014, operating revenues from wholesale and industrial customers combined represented approximately five percent of FPL's total operating revenues.
For the building of new steam and solar generating capacity of 75 MW or greater, the FPSC requires investor-owned electric utilities, including FPL, to issue an RFP except when the FPSC determines that an exception from the RFP process is in the public interest. The RFP process allows independent power producers and others to bid to supply the new generating capacity. If a bidder has the most cost-effective alternative, meets other criteria such as financial viability and demonstrates adequate expertise and experience in building and/or operating generating capacity of the type proposed, the investor-owned electric utility would seek to negotiate a purchased power agreement with the selected bidder and request that the FPSC approve the terms of the purchased power agreement and, if appropriate, provide the required authorization for the construction of the bidder's generating capacity.

FPL SOURCES OF GENERATION
At December 31, 2016, FPL's resources for serving load consisted of 26,836 MW, of which 26,017 MW were from FPL-owned facilities and approximately 819 MW were available through purchased power agreements, including 330 MW associated with a coal-fired generation facility located in Indiantown, Florida that FPL purchased in January 2017 (Indiantown generation facility) (see Note 13 - Contracts). FPL owned and operated 33 units that used fossil fuels, primarily natural gas, and had joint ownership interests in 3 coal units with an aggregate generating capacity of 22,305 MW. In addition, FPL owned, or had undivided interests in, and operated 4 nuclear units with generating capacity totaling 3,453 MW (see Nuclear Operations below) and 5 solar generation facilities with generating capacity totaling 259 MW (excluding 75 MW of non-incremental solar capability which is provided through a natural gas generation facility). FPL customer usage and operating revenues are typically higher during the summer months, largely due to the prevalent use of air conditioning in FPL's service territory. Occasionally, unusually cold temperatures during the winter months result in significant increases in electricity usage for short periods of time.
Fuel Sources
FPL relies upon a mix of fuel sources for its generation facilities, the ability of some of its generation facilities to operate on both natural gas and oil, and on purchased power to maintain the flexibility to achieve a more economical fuel mix in order to respond to market and industry developments. 

*Oil is less than 1% | *Oil and Solar are collectively less than 1%

Significant Fuel Contracts. As of December 31, 2016, FPL had the following significant fuel contracts in place:

• | FPL has firm transportation contracts for existing natural gas pipeline capacity with five different transportation suppliers, which provide for an aggregate maximum delivery quantity of 1,969,000 MMBtu/day with expiration dates ranging from 2017 to 2036. Together, these contracts are expected to satisfy substantially all of the currently anticipated needs for natural gas transportation through mid-2017. To the extent desirable, FPL also purchases interruptible natural gas transportation service from the five transportation suppliers.


• | FPL has 25-year natural gas transportation agreements with each of Sabal Trail and Florida Southeast Connection for a quantity of 400,000 MMBtu/day beginning in mid-2017 and increasing to 600,000 MMBtu/day in mid-2020. These new agreements, when combined with FPL's existing agreements, are expected to satisfy substantially all of FPL's natural gas transportation needs through at least 2020. FPL's firm commitments under the new agreements are contingent upon the occurrence of certain events, including the completion of construction of the pipeline system to be built by Sabal Trail and Florida Southeast Connection. See NEER - Generation and Other Operations - Other Operations below and Note 13 - Contracts.


• | FPL has several short- and medium-term natural gas supply contracts to provide a portion of FPL's anticipated needs for natural gas. The remainder of FPL's natural gas requirements is purchased in the spot market. FPL has an agreement for the storage of natural gas that expires in 2018.


• | FPL has several contracts for the supply of uranium and the conversion, enrichment and fabrication of nuclear fuel with expiration dates ranging from late February 2017 through 2031.

Nuclear Operations
At December 31, 2016, FPL owned, or had undivided interests in, and operated the following four nuclear units in Florida with a total net generating capacity of 3,453 MW. FPL's nuclear units are periodically removed from service to accommodate planned refueling and maintenance outages, including inspections, repairs and certain other modifications. Scheduled nuclear refueling outages typically require the unit to be removed from service for variable lengths of time.

Facility | FPL's Ownership(MW) | Beginning of Current or NextScheduled Refueling Outage | Operating LicenseExpiration Dates
St. Lucie Unit No. 1 | 981 | March 2018 | 2036 
St. Lucie Unit No. 2 | 840 | February 2017 | 2043 
Turkey Point Unit No. 3 | 811 | March 2017 | 2032 
Turkey Point Unit No. 4 | 821 | October 2017 | 2033 

NRC regulations require FPL to submit a plan for decontamination and decommissioning five years before the projected end of plant operation. FPL's current plans, under the applicable operating licenses, provide for prompt dismantlement of Turkey Point Units Nos. 3 and 4 with decommissioning activities commencing in 2032 and 2033, respectively. Current plans provide for St. Lucie Unit No. 1 to be mothballed beginning in 2036 with decommissioning activities to be integrated with the prompt dismantlement of St. Lucie Unit No. 2 commencing in 2043.
FPL's nuclear facilities use both on-site storage pools and dry storage casks to store spent nuclear fuel generated by these facilities, which are expected to provide sufficient storage of spent nuclear fuel at these facilities through license expiration.
Projects to Add Additional Capacity
FPL is in the process of adding the following additional capacity during the term of the 2016 rate agreement (see FPL Rate Regulation - Base Rates - Rates Effective January 2017 through December 2020 below): 

• | an approximately 1,750 MW natural gas-fired combined-cycle unit in Okeechobee County, Florida (Okeechobee Clean Energy Center), with a planned in-service date of mid-2019; and


• | up to 300 MW annually of new solar generation in each of 2017 through 2020.

FPL ENERGY MARKETING AND TRADING
FPL's Energy Marketing & Trading division (EMT) buys and sells wholesale energy commodities, such as natural gas, oil and electricity. EMT procures natural gas and oil for FPL's use in power generation and sells excess natural gas, oil and electricity. Prior to January 2017, EMT had utilized derivative instruments (primarily swaps, options and forwards) to manage the commodity price risk inherent in the purchase and sale of fuel and electricity. Under the 2016 rate agreement that is effective beginning January 2017 and discussed below, EMT will not enter into any new derivative instruments to manage its commodity price risk for the term of the 2016 rate agreement. Substantially all of the results of EMT's activities are passed through to customers in the fuel or capacity clauses. See Management's Discussion - Energy Marketing and Trading and Market Risk Sensitivity and Note 3.
FPL REGULATION
FPL's operations are subject to regulation by a number of federal, state and other organizations, including, but not limited to, the following:

• | the FPSC, which has jurisdiction over retail rates, service territory, issuances of securities, planning, siting and construction of facilities, among other things;


• | the FERC, which oversees the acquisition and disposition of generation, transmission and other facilities, transmission of electricity and natural gas in interstate commerce, proposals to build and operate interstate natural gas pipelines and storage facilities, and wholesale purchases and sales of electric energy, among other things;


• | the NERC, which, through its regional entities, establishes and enforces mandatory reliability standards, subject to approval by the FERC, to ensure the reliability of the U.S. electric transmission and generation system and to prevent major system blackouts;


• | the NRC, which has jurisdiction over the operation of nuclear power plants through the issuance of operating licenses, rules, regulations and orders; and


• | the EPA, which has the responsibility to maintain and enforce national standards under a variety of environmental laws. The EPA also works with industries and all levels of government, including federal and state governments, in a wide variety of voluntary pollution prevention programs and energy conservation efforts.

FPL Rate Regulation
The FPSC sets rates at a level that is intended to allow FPL the opportunity to collect from retail customers total revenues (revenue requirements) equal to FPL's cost of providing service, including a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. To accomplish this, the FPSC uses various ratemaking mechanisms, including, among other things, base rates and cost recovery clauses.
Base Rates. In general, the basic costs of providing electric service, other than fuel and certain other costs, are recovered through base rates, which are designed to recover the costs of constructing, operating and maintaining the utility system. These basic costs include O&M expenses, depreciation and taxes, as well as a return on FPL's investment in assets used and useful in providing electric service (rate base). At the time base rates are established, the allowed rate of return on rate base approximates the FPSC's determination of FPL's estimated weighted-average cost of capital, which includes its costs for outstanding debt and an allowed ROE. The FPSC monitors FPL's actual regulatory ROE through a surveillance report that is filed monthly by FPL with the FPSC. The FPSC does not provide assurance that any regulatory ROE will be achieved. Base rates are determined in rate proceedings or through negotiated settlements of those proceedings. Proceedings can occur at the initiative of FPL or upon action by the FPSC. Base rates remain in effect until new base rates are approved by the FPSC.
Rates Effective January 2017 through December 2020 - In December 2016, the FPSC issued a final order approving a stipulation and settlement between FPL and several intervenors in FPL's base rate proceeding (2016 rate agreement). Key elements of the 2016 rate agreement, which is effective from January 2017 through at least December 2020, include, among other things, the following: 

• | New retail base rates and charges were established resulting in the following increases in annualized retail base revenues:


◦ | $400 million beginning January 1, 2017;


◦ | $211 million beginning January 1, 2018; and


◦ | $200 million when the Okeechobee Clean Energy Center achieves commercial operation, which is expected to occur in mid-2019.


• | In addition, FPL is eligible to receive, subject to conditions specified in the 2016 rate agreement, base rate increases associated with the addition of up to 300 MW annually of new solar generation in each of 2017 through 2020 and may carry forward any unused MW to subsequent years during the term of the 2016 rate agreement. FPL will be required to demonstrate that any proposed solar facilities are cost effective and scheduled to be in service before December 31, 2021. FPL has agreed to an installed cost cap of $1,750 per kW.


• | FPL's allowed regulatory ROE is 10.55%, with a range of 9.60% to 11.60%. If FPL's earned regulatory ROE falls below 9.60%, FPL may seek retail base rate relief. If the earned regulatory ROE rises above 11.60%, any party other than FPL may seek a review of FPL's retail base rates.


• | Subject to certain conditions, FPL may amortize, over the term of the 2016 rate agreement, up to $1.0 billion of depreciation reserve surplus plus the reserve amount remaining under FPL's 2012 rate agreement discussed below (approximately $250 million), provided that in any year of the 2016 rate agreement, FPL must amortize at least enough reserve to maintain a 9.60% earned regulatory ROE but may not amortize any reserve that would result in an earned regulatory ROE in excess of 11.60%.


• | Future storm restoration costs would be recoverable on an interim basis beginning 60 days from the filing of a cost recovery petition, but capped at an amount that could produce a surcharge of no more than $4 for every 1,000 kWh of usage on residential bills during the first 12 months of cost recovery. Any additional costs would be eligible for recovery in subsequent years. If storm restoration costs exceed $800 million in any given calendar year, FPL may request an increase to the $4 surcharge to recover amounts above $400 million.

In January 2017, the Sierra Club filed a notice of appeal challenging the FPSC’s final order approving the 2016 rate agreement, which notice of appeal is pending before the Florida Supreme Court.
Rates Effective January 2013 through December 2016 - Effective January 2013, pursuant to an FPSC final order approving a stipulation and settlement between FPL and several intervenors in FPL's base rate proceeding (2012 rate agreement), new retail base rates and charges for FPL were established resulting in an increase in retail base revenues of $350 million on an annualized basis. The 2012 rate agreement, provided for, among other things, the following:
•a regulatory ROE of 10.50% with a range of plus or minus 100 basis points;

• | an increase in annualized base revenue requirements as each of three FPL modernized power plants became operational in April 2013, April 2014 and April 2016;


• | the continuation of cost recovery through the capacity clause (reported as retail base revenues) for a generating unit which was placed in service in May 2011 (beginning January 2017, under the 2016 rate agreement, cost recovery will be through base rates);


• | subject to certain conditions, the right to reduce depreciation expense up to $400 million (reserve), provided that in any year of the 2012 rate agreement, FPL was required to amortize enough reserve to maintain an earned regulatory ROE within the range of 9.50% to 11.50% (see below regarding a subsequent reduction in the reserve amount);


• | an interim cost recovery mechanism for storm restoration costs (see Note 1 - Securitized Storm-Recovery Costs, Storm Fund and Storm Reserve); and

10


• | an incentive mechanism whereby customers receive 100% of certain gains, including but not limited to gains from the purchase and sale of electricity and natural gas (including transportation and storage), up to a specified threshold; gains exceeding that specified threshold were shared by FPL and its customers.

In August 2015, the FPSC approved a stipulation and settlement between the Office of Public Counsel and FPL regarding issues relating to the ratemaking treatment for FPL’s purchase of a 250 MW coal-fired generation facility located in Jacksonville, Florida (Cedar Bay generation facility), which FPL retired in December 2016. As part of this settlement, the amount of the reserve was reduced by $30 million to $370 million. 
Cost Recovery Clauses. Cost recovery clauses are designed to permit full recovery of certain costs and provide a return on certain assets allowed to be recovered through the various clauses. Cost recovery clause costs are recovered through levelized monthly charges per kWh or kW, depending on the customer's rate class. These cost recovery clause charges are calculated at least annually based on estimated costs and estimated customer usage for the following year, plus or minus true-up adjustments to reflect the estimated over or under recovery of costs for the current and prior periods. An adjustment to the levelized charges may be approved during the course of a year to reflect revised estimates. FPL recovers costs from customers through the following clauses:

• | Fuel - fuel costs and energy charges relating to purchased power agreements, the most significant of the cost recovery clauses in terms of operating revenues (see Note 1 - Rate Regulation);


• | Capacity - primarily capacity payments to non-utility generators and other utilities and certain costs associated with the acquisition of the Cedar Bay generation facility (see Note 1 - Rate Regulation);


• | Energy Conservation - costs associated with implementing energy conservation programs; and


• | Environmental - certain costs of complying with federal, state and local environmental regulations enacted after April 1993 and costs associated with three of FPL's solar facilities.

The FPSC has the authority to disallow recovery of costs that it considers excessive or imprudently incurred. These costs may include, among others, fuel and O&M expenses, the cost of replacing power lost when fossil and nuclear units are unavailable, storm restoration costs and costs associated with the construction or acquisition of new facilities.
FERC
The Federal Power Act grants the FERC exclusive ratemaking jurisdiction over wholesale sales of electricity and the transmission of electricity and natural gas in interstate commerce. Pursuant to the Federal Power Act, electric utilities must maintain tariffs and rate schedules on file with the FERC which govern the rates, terms and conditions for the provision of FERC-jurisdictional wholesale power and transmission services. The Federal Power Act also gives the FERC authority to certify and oversee a national electric reliability organization with authority to establish and independently enforce mandatory reliability standards applicable to all users, owners and operators of the bulk-power system. See NERC below. Electric utilities are subject to accounting, record-keeping and reporting requirements administered by the FERC. The FERC also places certain limitations on transactions between electric utilities and their affiliates.
NERC
The NERC has been certified by the FERC as the national electric reliability organization. The NERC's mandate is to ensure the reliability and security of the North American bulk-power system through the establishment and enforcement of reliability standards approved by FERC. The NERC's regional entities also enforce reliability standards approved by the FERC. FPL is subject to these reliability standards and incurs costs to ensure compliance with continually heightened requirements, and can incur significant penalties for failing to comply with them.
FPL Environmental Regulation
FPL is subject to environmental laws and regulations as described in the NEE Environmental Matters section below. FPL expects to seek recovery through the environmental clause for compliance costs associated with any new environmental laws and regulations.
FPL EMPLOYEES
FPL had approximately 8,900 employees at December 31, 2016. Approximately 34% of the employees are represented by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) under a collective bargaining agreement with FPL that expires October 31, 2017.
NEER
NEER, a limited liability company organized under the laws of Delaware, was formed in 1998 to aggregate NEE's competitive energy businesses. NEER is a diversified clean energy company with a business strategy that emphasizes the development, acquisition and operation of long-term contracted assets with a focus on renewable projects. Through its subsidiaries, NEER currently owns, develops, constructs, manages and operates electric generation facilities in wholesale energy markets primarily in the U.S., as well 
11

as in Canada and Spain. See Note 14 for information on revenues from foreign sources and long–lived assets located in foreign countries. NEER, with approximately 19,882 MW of generating capacity at December 31, 2016, is one of the largest wholesale generators of electric power in the U.S., with approximately 18,862 MW of generating capacity across 29 states, and has 920 MW of generating capacity in 4 Canadian provinces and 99.8 MW of generating capacity in Spain. NEER produces the majority of its electricity from clean and renewable sources as described more fully below. NEER is the largest generator in the world of electric power from wind and universal solar energy projects based on 2016 MWh produced. NEER also owned and operated approximately 200 substations and 1,240 circuit miles of transmission lines at December 31, 2016.
NEER also engages in energy-related commodity marketing and trading activities, including entering into financial and physical contracts, to hedge the production from its generation assets that is not sold under long-term power supply agreements. These contracts primarily include power and gas commodities and their related products, as well as provide full energy and capacity requirements services primarily to distribution utilities in certain markets and offer customized power and gas and related risk management services to wholesale customers. In addition, NEER participates in natural gas, natural gas liquids and oil production primarily through non-operating ownership interests, and in pipeline infrastructure development, construction, management and operations, through either wholly owned subsidiaries or noncontrolling or joint venture interests, hereafter referred to as the gas infrastructure business. NEER also hedges the expected output from its gas infrastructure production assets to protect against price movements. 
As discussed in the Overview above, during 2014, NEP was formed to acquire, manage and own contracted clean energy projects with stable, long-term cash flows through a limited partner interest in NEP OpCo. Through an indirect wholly owned subsidiary, NEE owns 101,440,000 common units of NEP OpCo representing a noncontrolling interest in NEP's operating projects of approximately 65.2% as of December 31, 2016. NEE owns a controlling general partner interest in NEP and consolidates NEP for financial reporting purposes. See Note 1 - NextEra Energy Partners, LP. As of December 31, 2016, NEP, through the combination of NEER's contribution of energy projects to NEP OpCo in connection with NEP’s IPO in July 2014 and the acquisition of additional energy projects from NEER in 2015 and 2016, owns, or has an interest in, a portfolio of 22 wind and solar projects with generating capacity totaling approximately 2,787 MW and long-term contracted natural gas pipeline assets as discussed below. In addition in 2015, NEP OpCo issued 2 million NEP OpCo Class B Units to NEER in exchange for an approximately 50% ownership interest in three solar projects with a total generating capacity of 277 MW. NEER, as holder of the Class B Units, will retain 100% of the economic interests if, and until, NEER offers to sell the economic interests to NEP and NEP accepts such offer. NEP OpCo has a right of first offer for certain of NEER's assets (ROFO assets) if NEER should seek to sell the assets. The ROFO assets remaining as of December 31, 2016, include contracted wind and solar projects with a combined capacity of approximately 1,076 MW. In 2015, NEP completed the acquisition of the membership interests in NET Holdings Management, LLC (Texas pipeline business), a developer, owner and operator of a portfolio of seven intrastate long-term contracted natural gas pipeline assets located in Texas (Texas pipelines). See Generation and Other Operations - Contracted, Merchant and Other Operations - Other Operations below.

GENERATION AND OTHER OPERATIONS
NEER sells products associated with its own generation facilities (energy, capacity, renewable energy credits (RECs) and ancillary services) in competitive markets in regions where those facilities are located. Customer transactions may be supplied from NEER generation facilities or from purchases in the wholesale markets, or from a combination thereof. See Markets and Competition below.
At December 31, 2016, NEER managed or participated in the management of essentially all of its generation projects and all of its natural gas pipeline assets in which it has an ownership interest. At December 31, 2016, the locations of NEER's generation facilities and natural gas pipeline assets in North America were as follows:

Contracted, Merchant and Other Operations
NEER's portfolio of generation operations based on the presence/absence of long-term power sales agreements and other operations was as follows: 


*Solar is less than 1%

Contracted Generation Assets. Contracted generation assets are generation facilities with long-term power sales agreements for substantially all of their capacity and/or energy output. Information related to contracted generation assets as of December 31, 2016 was as follows:

• | represented approximately 15,994 MW of generating capacity;


• | weighted average remaining contract term of approximately 17 years, based on forecasted contributions to earnings; and


• | contracts for the supply of uranium and the conversion, enrichment and fabrication of nuclear fuel have expiration dates ranging from late February 2017 through 2032 (see Note 13 - Contracts).

14

Merchant Generation Assets. Merchant generation assets are generation facilities that do not have long-term power sales agreements to sell their capacity and/or energy output and therefore require active marketing and hedging. Information related to merchant generation assets as of December 31, 2016 was as follows:

• | represented approximately 3,888 MW of generating capacity, including 781 MW of oil-fired peak generation facilities;


• | primarily located in Texas and the Northeast regions of the U.S.;


• | contracts for the supply of uranium and the conversion, enrichment and fabrication of nuclear fuel have expiration dates ranging from August 2017 through 2029 (see Note 13 - Contracts); and

______________________

(a) | In 2010, NEER filed an application with the NRC to renew Seabrook's operating license for an additional 20 years, which license renewal is dependent on NRC regulatory approvals.


(b) | NEER sells all of its share of the output of Duane Arnold under a long-term contract expiring in December 2025.


(c) | NEER sells all of the output of Point Beach Units Nos. 1 and 2 under long-term contracts through their current operating license expiration dates.

NEER is responsible for all nuclear unit operations and the ultimate decommissioning of the nuclear units, the cost of which is shared on a pro-rata basis by the joint owners for the jointly-owned units. NRC regulations require plant owners to submit a plan for decontamination and decommissioning five years before the projected end of plant operation.
NEER's nuclear facilities use both on-site storage pools and dry storage casks to store spent nuclear fuel generated by these facilities, which are expected to provide sufficient storage of spent nuclear fuel at these facilities through license expiration.
Policy Incentives for Renewable Energy Projects
U.S. federal, state and local governments have established various incentives to support the development of renewable energy projects. These incentives include accelerated tax depreciation, PTCs, ITCs, cash grants, tax abatements and RPS programs. Wind and solar projects qualify as five-year property that is eligible to be depreciated under the U.S. federal Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS). Pursuant to MACRS, wind and solar projects are fully depreciated for tax purposes over a five-year period even though the useful life of such projects is generally much longer than five years.
Owners of utility-scale wind facilities are eligible to claim an income tax credit (the PTC, or an ITC in lieu of the PTC) upon initially achieving commercial operation. The PTC is determined based on the amount of electricity produced by the wind facility during the first ten years of commercial operation. This incentive was created under the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and has been extended several times. Alternatively, an ITC equal to 30% of the cost of a wind facility may be claimed in lieu of the PTC. In December 2015, the PTC (and ITC in lieu of PTC) for wind facilities was extended for five years, subject to the phase-down schedule in the table below. In order to qualify for the PTC (or ITC in lieu of PTC), construction of a wind facility must begin before a specified date. The IRS previously issued guidance setting forth two alternatives pursuant to which a taxpayer may begin construction on a wind facility and providing that the taxpayer must maintain a continuous program of construction or continuous efforts to advance the project to completion. In May 2016, the IRS issued additional guidance relating to the December 2015 extension and phase-down of the PTC and ITC for wind facilities. In general, this guidance modifies and extends the safe harbor for the continuous efforts and continuous construction requirements to four years compared to two years under the previous guidance. The safe harbor will generally be satisfied if the facility is placed in service no more than four calendar years after the calendar year in which construction of the facility began. The IRS also confirmed that retrofitted wind facilities may re-qualify for PTCs or ITCs pursuant to the 5% safe harbor for the begin construction requirement, as long as the cost basis of the new investment is at least 80% of the facility’s total fair value. 
Owners of solar projects are eligible to claim a 30% ITC for new solar projects, or can elect to receive an equivalent cash payment from the U.S. Department of Treasury for the value of the 30% ITC (convertible ITC) for qualifying solar projects where construction began before the end of 2011 and the projects are placed in service before 2017. In December 2015, the 30% ITC for new solar projects was extended, subject to the following phase-down schedule. 

 | Year construction of project begins
 | 2015 | | 2016 | | 2017 | 2018 | | 2019 | | 2020 | 2021 | | 2022
PTC(a) | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 80 | % | | 60 | % | 40 | % | | - | | - | | - | 
Wind ITC | 30 | % | | 30 | % | 24 | % | | 18 | % | 12 | % | | - | | - | | - | 
Solar ITC(b) | 30 | % | | 30 | % | 30 | % | | 30 | % | 30 | % | | 26 | % | 22 | % | 10 | %

_________________________

(a) | Percentage of the full PTC available for wind projects that begin construction during the applicable year.


(b) | ITC is limited to 10% for projects not placed in service before January 1, 2024.

Other countries, including Canada and Spain, provide for incentives like feed-in-tariffs for renewable energy projects. The feed-in-tariffs promote renewable energy investments by offering long-term contracts to renewable energy producers, typically based on the cost of generation of each technology.

MARKETS AND COMPETITION
Electricity markets in the U.S. and Canada are regional and diverse in character. All are extensively regulated, and competition in these markets is shaped and constrained by regulation. The nature of the products offered varies based on the specifics of regulation in each region. Generally, in addition to the natural constraints on pricing freedom presented by competition, NEER may also face specific constraints in the form of price caps, or maximum allowed prices, for certain products. NEER's ability to sell the output of its generation facilities may also be constrained by available transmission capacity, which can vary from time to time and can have a significant impact on pricing.
The degree and nature of competition that NEER faces is different in wholesale markets and in retail markets. During 2016, approximately 86% of NEER's revenue was derived from wholesale electricity markets.
Wholesale power generation is a capital-intensive, commodity-driven business with numerous industry participants. NEER primarily competes on the basis of price, but believes the green attributes of NEER's generation assets, its creditworthiness and its ability to offer and manage reliable customized risk solutions to wholesale customers are competitive advantages. Wholesale power generation is a regional business that is highly fragmented relative to many other commodity industries and diverse in terms of industry structure. As such, there is a wide variation in terms of the capabilities, resources, nature and identity of the companies NEER competes with depending on the market. In wholesale markets, customers' needs are met through a variety of means, including long-term bilateral contracts, standardized bilateral products such as full requirements service and customized supply and risk management services.
In general, U.S. electricity markets encompass three classes of services: energy, capacity and ancillary services. Energy services relate to the physical delivery of power; capacity services relate to the availability of MW capacity of a power generation asset; and ancillary services are other services that relate to power generation assets, such as load regulation and spinning and non-spinning reserves. The exact nature of these classes of services is defined in part by regional tariffs. Not all regions have a capacity services class, and the specific definitions of ancillary services vary from region to region.
RTOs and ISOs exist throughout much of North America to coordinate generation and transmission across wide geographic areas and to run markets. NEER operates in all RTO and ISO jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2016, NEER also had operations of approximately 3,114 MWs that fall within reliability regions that are not under the jurisdiction of an established RTO or ISO, including 2,519 MWs within the Western Electricity Coordinating Council. Although each RTO and ISO may have differing objectives and structures, some benefits of these entities include regional planning, managing transmission congestion, developing larger wholesale markets for energy and capacity, maintaining reliability and facilitating competition among wholesale electricity providers. NEER has operations that fall within the following RTOs and ISOs:
18

NEER competes in different regions to different degrees, but in general it seeks to enter into long-term bilateral contracts for the full output of its generation facilities, and, as of December 31, 2016, approximately 80% of NEER's generating capacity was committed under long-term contracts. Where long-term contracts are not in effect, NEER sells the output of its facilities into daily spot markets. In such cases, NEER will frequently enter into shorter term bilateral contracts, typically of less than three years duration, to hedge the price risk associated with selling into a daily spot market. Such bilateral contracts, which may be hedges either for physical delivery or for financial (pricing) offset, may only protect a portion of the revenue that NEER expects to derive from the associated generation facility and may not qualify for hedge accounting under GAAP. Contracts that serve the economic purpose of hedging some portion of the expected revenue of a generation facility but are not recorded as hedges under GAAP are referred to as “non-qualifying hedges” for adjusted earnings purposes. See Management's Discussion - Overview - Adjusted Earnings.
Certain facilities within the NEER wind and solar generation portfolio produce RECs and other environmental attributes which are typically sold along with the energy from the plants under long-term contracts, or may be sold separately for the wind and solar generation not sold under long-term contracts. The purchasing party is solely entitled to the reporting rights and ownership of the environmental attributes.
While the majority of NEER's revenue is derived from the output of its generation facilities, NEER is also an active competitor in several regions in the wholesale full requirements business and in providing structured and customized power and fuel products and services to a variety of customers. In the full requirements service, typically, the supplier agrees to meet the customer's needs for a full range of products for every hour of the day, at a fixed price, for a predetermined period of time, thereby assuming the risk of fluctuations in the customer's volume requirements.
Expanded competition in a frequently changing regulatory environment presents both opportunities and risks for NEER. Opportunities exist for the selective acquisition of generation assets and for the construction and operation of efficient facilities that can sell power in competitive markets. NEER seeks to reduce its market risk by having a diversified portfolio by fuel type and location, as well as by contracting for the future sale of a significant amount of the electricity output of its facilities.
NEER REGULATION
The energy markets in which NEER operates are subject to domestic and foreign regulation, as the case may be, including local, state and federal regulation, and other specific rules.
At December 31, 2016, NEER had ownership interests in operating independent power projects located in the U.S. that have received exempt wholesale generator status as defined under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005, which represent approximately 99% of NEER's net generating capacity in the U.S. Exempt wholesale generators own or operate a facility exclusively to sell electricity to wholesale customers. They are barred from selling electricity directly to retail customers. NEER's exempt wholesale generators produce electricity from wind, fossil fuels, solar and nuclear facilities. Essentially all of the remaining 1% of NEER's net generating capacity has qualifying facility status under the PURPA. NEER's qualifying facilities generate electricity primarily from wind, solar and fossil fuels. Qualifying facility status exempts the projects from, among other things, many of the provisions of the Federal Power Act, as well as state laws and regulations relating to rates and financial or organizational regulation of electric utilities. While projects with qualifying facility and/or exempt wholesale generator status are exempt from various restrictions, each project must still comply with other federal, state and local laws, including, but not limited to, those regarding siting, construction, operation, licensing, pollution abatement and other environmental laws.
Additionally, most of the NEER facilities located in the U.S. are subject to FERC regulations and market rules and the NERC's mandatory reliability standards, all of its facilities are subject to environmental laws and the EPA's environmental regulations, and its nuclear facilities are also subject to the jurisdiction of the NRC. See FPL - FPL Regulation for additional discussion of FERC, NERC, NRC and EPA regulations. With the exception of facilities located in ERCOT, the FERC has jurisdiction over various aspects of NEER's business in the U.S., including the oversight and investigation of competitive wholesale energy markets, regulation of the transmission and sale of natural gas, and oversight of environmental matters related to natural gas projects and major electricity policy initiatives. The PUCT has jurisdiction, including the regulation of rates and services, oversight of competitive markets, and enforcement of statutes and rules, over NEER facilities located in ERCOT.
NEER and its affiliates are also subject to federal and provincial or regional regulations in Canada and Spain related to energy operations, energy markets and environmental standards. In Canada, activities related to owning and operating wind and solar projects and participating in wholesale and retail energy markets are regulated at the provincial level. In Ontario, for example, electricity generation facilities must be licensed by the Ontario Energy Board and may also be required to complete registrations and maintain market participant status with the Independent Electricity System Operator, in which case they must agree to be bound by and comply with the provisions of the market rules for the Ontario electricity market as well as the mandatory reliability standards of the NERC. 
In addition, NEER is subject to environmental laws and regulations as described in the NEE Environmental Matters section below. In order to better anticipate potential regulatory changes, NEER continues to actively evaluate and participate in regional market redesigns of existing operating rules for the integration of renewable energy resources and for the purchase and sale of energy commodities.
19

NEER EMPLOYEES
NEER and its subsidiaries had approximately 5,300 employees at December 31, 2016. Certain subsidiaries of NEER have collective bargaining agreements with the IBEW, the Utility Workers Union of America, the Security Police and Fire Professionals of America and the International Union of Operating Engineers, which collectively represent approximately 17% of NEER's employees. The collective bargaining agreements have three- to five-year terms and expire between 2018 and 2021.
NEE ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
NEE and FPL are subject to domestic and foreign environmental laws and regulations, including extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations, for the siting, construction and ongoing operations of their facilities. The U.S. Congress and certain states and regions, as well as the Government of Canada and its provinces, have taken and continue to take certain actions, such as proposing and finalizing regulation or setting targets or goals, regarding the reduction of GHG emissions and the increase of renewable energy generation. Numerous environmental regulations also affecting FPL, NEER and certain other subsidiaries relate to threatened and endangered species and their habitats, as well as other avian and bat species. Complying with these environmental laws and regulations results in, among other things, changes in the design and operation of existing facilities and changes or delays in the location, design, construction and operation of new facilities. The impact of complying with current environmental laws and regulations has not had, and, along with compliance with proposed regulations as currently written, is not expected to have, a material adverse effect on the financial statements of NEE and FPL. As permitted by the environmental clause, FPL expects to seek recovery for compliance costs associated with any new environmental laws and regulations.
WEBSITE ACCESS TO SEC FILINGS
NEE and FPL make their SEC filings, including the annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports, available free of charge on NEE's internet website, www.nexteraenergy.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after those documents are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. The information and materials available on NEE's website (or any of its subsidiaries' websites) are not incorporated by reference into this combined Form 10-K. The SEC maintains an internet website that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding registrants that file electronically with the SEC at www.sec.gov.
