ITEM 1 â€“ BUSINESS
 
American National Bankshares Inc. is a one-bank holding company organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia in 1984. On September 1, 1984, the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of American National Bank and Trust Company, a national banking association chartered in 1909 under the laws of the United States. American National Bank and Trust Company is the only banking subsidiary of the Company.
 
As of December 31, 2021, the operations of the Company were conducted at 26 banking offices in south central Virginia and north central North Carolina and one loan production office in Roanoke, Virginia. Through these offices, the Company serves its primary market area of south central Virginia and north central North Carolina. The Bank provides a full array of financial products and services, including commercial, mortgage, and consumer banking; trust and investment services; and insurance. Services are also provided through 37 Automated Teller Machines ("ATMs"), "Online Banking," and "Telephone Banking."
 
On April 1, 2019, the Company completed the acquisition of Roanoke-based HomeTown Bankshares Corporation ("HomeTown"). The acquisition of HomeTown deepened the Company's footprint in the Roanoke, Virginia metropolitan area and created a presence in the New River Valley with an office in Christiansburg, Virginia.
 
The Company has two reportable segments, (i) community banking and (ii) wealth management. For more financial data and other information about each of the Company's operating segments, refer to "Note 21 - Segment and Related Information" of the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
 
Competition and Markets
 
Vigorous competition exists in the Company's service areas. The Company competes not only with national, regional, and community banks, but also with other types of financial institutions including finance companies, mutual and money market fund providers, financial technology companies, brokerage firms, wealth management firms, insurance companies, credit unions, and mortgage companies.
 
The Company's primary market area is south central Virginia and north central North Carolina. The Company also has a significant presence in Roanoke, Virginia that increased substantially in connection with the acquisition of HomeTown. The Company's Virginia banking offices are located in the cities of Danville, Lynchburg, Martinsville, Roanoke, and Salem and in the counties of Campbell, Franklin, Halifax, Henry, Montgomery, Pittsylvania and Roanoke. In North Carolina, the Company's banking offices are located in the cities of Burlington, Graham, Greensboro, Mebane, Raleigh, Winston-Salem, and Yanceyville, which are within the counties of Alamance, Caswell, Forsyth, Guilford, and Wake.

The Company has the largest deposit market share in the City of Danville, Virginia. The Company had a deposit market share in the Danville Micropolitan Statistical Area of 38.32% at June 30, 2021 based on Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") data. The Company has the second largest deposit market share in Pittsylvania County, Virginia. The Company had a deposit market share in the County of 26.23% at June 30, 2021, based on FDIC data.
 
Unemployment levels in each Virginia market the Company serves have continued to improve from their COVID-19 related highs in early to mid-2020. Service sectors, financials, medical, manufacturing, construction, timber management and production, and technology related businesses have remained strong while hospitality, restaurants, travel & tourism, meeting spaces, and fitness facilities continue to suffer from the COVID-19 restrictions. Other important business industries include farming, tobacco processing and sales, and food processing. New businesses continue to move into the Company's Virginia footprint, which has been positive for economic growth.
 
The Company's market area in North Carolina has strong competition in attracting deposits and making loans. Its most direct competition for deposits comes from commercial banks and credit unions located in the market area, including large financial institutions that have greater financial and marketing resources available to them. The Company had a deposit market share in Alamance County of 14.35% at June 30, 2021, based on FDIC data, which was the third largest of any FDIC-insured institution.
 
Supervision and Regulation
 
The Company and the Bank are extensively regulated under federal and state law. The following description briefly addresses certain provisions of federal and state laws and regulations, and their potential effects on the Company and the Bank. Proposals to change the laws, regulations, and policies governing the banking industry are frequently raised in U.S. Congress, in state legislatures, and before the various bank regulatory agencies. The likelihood and timing of any changes and the impact such changes might have on the Company and the Bank are impossible to determine with any certainty. A change in applicable laws, regulations or policies, or a change in the way such laws, regulations or policies are interpreted by regulatory agencies or courts, may have a material impact on the business, operations, and earnings of the Company and the Bank.
American National Bankshares Inc.
 
American National Bankshares Inc. is qualified as a bank holding company ("BHC") within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the "BHC Act"), and is registered as such with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "FRB"). As a bank holding company, the Company is subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the FRB and is required to file various reports and additional information with the FRB. The Company is also registered under the bank holding company laws of Virginia and is subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the Bureau of Financial Institutions of the Virginia State Corporation Commission (the "SCC").
American National Bank and Trust Company
 
American National Bank and Trust Company is a federally chartered national bank and is a member of the Federal Reserve System. As a national bank, the Bank is subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the "OCC") and is required to file various reports and additional information with the OCC. The OCC has primary supervisory and regulatory authority over the operations of the Bank. Because the Bank accepts insured deposits from the public, it is also subject to examination by the FDIC.
 
Depository institutions, including the Bank, are subject to extensive federal and state regulations that significantly affect their business and activities. Regulatory bodies have broad authority to implement standards and initiate proceedings designed to prohibit depository institutions from engaging in unsafe and unsound banking practices. The standards relate generally to operations and management, asset quality, interest rate exposure, and capital. The bank regulatory agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards.
 
As with other financial institutions, the earnings of the Bank are affected by general economic conditions and by the monetary policies of the FRB. The FRB exerts a substantial influence on interest rates and credit conditions, primarily through open market operations in U.S. Government securities, setting the reserve requirements of member banks, and establishing the discount rate on member bank borrowings. The policies of the FRB have a direct impact on loan and deposit growth and the interest rates charged and paid thereon. They also impact the source, cost of funds, and the rates of return on investments. Changes in the FRB's monetary policies have had a significant impact on the operating results of the Bank and other financial institutions and are expected to continue to do so in the future; however, the exact impact of such conditions and policies upon the future business and earnings cannot accurately be predicted.
 
Deposit Insurance
 
The deposits of the Bank are insured up to applicable limits by the DIF and are subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the DIF. The deposit insurance assessment base of the Bank is based on its average total assets minus average tangible equity, pursuant to a rule issued by the FDIC as required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act"). The FDIC uses a "financial ratios method" based on CAMELS composite ratings to determine assessment rates for small established institutions with less than $10 billion in assets, such as the Bank. The CAMELS rating system is a supervisory rating system designed to take into account and reflect all financial and operational risks that a bank may face, including capital adequacy, asset quality, management capability, earnings, liquidity and sensitivity to market risk ("CAMELS"). CAMELS composite ratings set a maximum assessment for CAMELS 1 and 2 rated banks, and set minimum assessments for lower rated institutions.
 
    5 

  

 In March 2016, the FDIC implemented by final rule certain Dodd-Frank Act provisions by raising the DIF's minimum reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35%. The FDIC imposed a 4.5 basis point annual surcharge on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more. The rule granted credits to smaller banks, such as the Bank, for the portion of their regular assessments that contributed to increasing the reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35%. In 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded expense of $864,000 and $639,000, respectively, for FDIC insurance premiums.
 
Capital Requirements

The FRB, the OCC and the FDIC have issued substantially similar capital guidelines applicable to all banks and bank holding companies. In addition, those regulatory agencies may from time to time require that a banking organization maintain capital above the minimum levels because of its financial condition or actual or anticipated growth.
 
Effective January 1, 2015, the Company and the Bank became subject to rules implementing the Basel III regulatory capital reforms from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the "Basel Committee") and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act (the "Basel III Capital Rules"). The Basel III Capital Rules require the Company and the Bank to comply with the following minimum capital ratios: (i) a ratio of common equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets ("CET1") of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5% "capital conservation buffer" (effectively resulting in a minimum CET1 ratio of at least 7%), (ii) a ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer (effectively resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%), (iii) a ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer (effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5%), and (iv) a leverage ratio of 4%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average assets. The capital conservation buffer, which was phased in ratably over a four year period beginning January 1, 2016, is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Institutions with a CET1 ratio above the minimum (4.5%) but below the minimum plus the conservation buffer (7.0%) will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases, and discretionary compensation paid to certain officers, based on the amount of the shortfall. 
 
With respect to the Bank, the "prompt corrective action" regulations pursuant to Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the "FDIA") were also revised, effective as of January 1, 2015, to incorporate a CET1 ratio and to increase certain other capital ratios. To be well capitalized under the revised regulations, a bank must have the following minimum capital ratios: (i) a CET1 ratio of at least 6.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of at least 8.0%; (iii) a total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of at least 10.0%; and (iv) a leverage ratio of at least 5.0%. See "Prompt Corrective Action" below.
 
The Tier 1 and total capital to risk-weighted asset ratios of the Company were 13.73% and 14.61%, respectively, as of December 31, 2021, thus exceeding the minimum requirements. The CET 1 ratio of the Company was 12.43% and the Bank was 13.15% as of December 31, 2021. The Tier 1 and total capital to risk-weighted asset ratios of the Bank were 13.15% and 14.03%, respectively, as of December 31, 2021, also exceeding the minimum requirements.
 
The Basel III Capital Rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. In July 2019, the federal banking agencies adopted final rules (the "Capital Simplification Rules") that, among other things, revised these deductions and adjustments. Following the adoption of the Capital Simplification Rules, certain deferred tax assets and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities must be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 25% of CET1. Prior to the adoption of the Capital Simplification Rules, amounts were deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeded 10% of CET1 or all such items, in the aggregate, exceeded 15% of CET1. The Capital Simplification Rules took effect for the Company as of January 1, 2020. These limitations did not impact regulatory capital during any of the reported periods.
 
The Basel III Capital Rules prescribe a standardized approach for risk weightings that expanded the risk-weighting categories from the general risk-based capital rules to a much larger and more risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the assets, generally ranging from 0% for U.S. government and agency securities, to 600% for certain equity exposures (and higher percentages for certain other types of interests), and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories. In November 2019, the federal banking agencies adopted a rule revising the scope of commercial real estate mortgages subject to a 150% risk weight.
 
In December 2017, the Basel Committee published standards that it described as the finalization of the Basel III post-crisis regulatory reforms (the standards are commonly referred to as "Basel IV"). Among other things, these standards revise the Basel Committee's standardized approach for credit risk (including by recalibrating risk weights and introducing new capital requirements for certain "unconditionally cancellable commitments," such as unused credit card lines of credit) and provide a new standardized approach for operational risk capital. Under the current capital rules, operational risk capital requirements and a capital floor apply only to advanced approaches institutions, and not to the Company. The impact of Basel IV on the Company and the Bank will depend on the manner in which it is implemented by the federal bank regulatory agencies.
 
On September 17, 2019, the federal banking agencies jointly issued a final rule required by the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act of 2018 (the "EGRRCPA") that permits qualifying banks and bank holding companies that have less than $10 billion in consolidated assets to elect to be subject to a 9% leverage ratio (commonly referred to as the community bank leverage ratio or "CBLR"). Under the final rule, banks and bank holding companies that opt into the CBLR framework and maintain a CBLR of greater than 9% are not subject to other risk-based and leverage capital requirements under the Basel III Capital Rules and are deemed to have met the well capitalized ratio requirements under the "prompt corrective action" framework. In addition, a community bank that falls out of compliance with the framework has a two-quarter grace period to come back into full compliance, provided its leverage ratio remains above 8%, and will be deemed well-capitalized during the grace period. The CBLR framework was first available for banking organizations to use in their March 31, 2020 regulatory reports. These CBLR rules were modified in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. See "Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act and Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021" below. The Company and the Bank do not currently expect to opt into the CBLR framework.

Dividends
 
The Company's principal source of cash flow, including cash flow to pay dividends to its shareholders, is dividends it receives from the Bank. Statutory and regulatory limitations apply to the Bank's payment of dividends to the Company. As a general rule, the amount of a dividend may not exceed, without prior regulatory approval, the sum of net income in the calendar year to date and the retained net earnings of the immediately preceding two calendar years. A depository institution may not pay any dividend if payment would cause the institution to become "undercapitalized" or if it already is "undercapitalized." The OCC may prevent the payment of a dividend if it determines that the payment would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. The OCC also has advised that a national bank should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings.
Permitted Activities
 
As a bank holding company, the permitted activities of the Company are limited to managing or controlling banks, furnishing services to or performing services for its subsidiaries, and engaging in other activities that the FRB determines by regulation or order to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. In determining whether a particular activity is permissible, the FRB must consider whether the performance of such an activity reasonably can be expected to produce benefits to the public that outweigh possible adverse effects. Possible benefits include greater convenience, increased competition, and gains in efficiency. Possible adverse effects include undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest, and unsound banking practices. Despite prior approval, the FRB may order a bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity or to terminate ownership or control of any subsidiary when the FRB has reasonable cause to believe that a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of any bank subsidiary of that bank holding company may result from such an activity.
Banking Acquisitions; Changes in Control
 
The BHC Act and related regulations require, among other things, the prior approval of the FRB in any case where a bank holding company proposes to (i) acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the outstanding voting stock of any bank or bank holding company (unless it already owns a majority of such voting shares), (ii) acquire all or substantially all of the assets of another bank or bank holding company, or (iii) merge or consolidate with any other bank holding company. In determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition, the FRB will consider, among other factors, the effect of the acquisition on competition, the public benefits expected to be received from the acquisition, any outstanding regulatory compliance issues of any institution that is a party to the transaction, the projected capital ratios and levels on a post-acquisition basis, the financial condition of each institution that is a party to the transaction and of the combined institution after the transaction, the parties' managerial resources and risk management and governance processes and systems, the parties' compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering requirements, and the acquiring institution's performance under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, as amended (the "CRA"), and compliance with fair housing and other consumer protection laws.
 
Subject to certain exceptions, the BHC Act and the Change in Bank Control Act, together with the applicable regulations, require FRB approval (or, depending on the circumstances, no notice of disapproval) prior to any person or company acquiring "control" of a bank or bank holding company. A conclusive presumption of control exists if an individual or company acquires the power, directly or indirectly, to direct the management or policies of an insured depository institution or to vote 25% or more of any class of voting securities of any insured depository institution. A rebuttable presumption of control exists if a person or company acquires 10% or more but less than 25% of any class of voting securities of an insured depository institution and either the institution has registered its securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") or no other person will own a greater percentage of that class of voting securities immediately after the acquisition. The Company's common stock is registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act.
 
In addition, Virginia law requires the prior approval of the SCC for (i) the acquisition by a Virginia bank holding company of more than 5% of the voting shares of a Virginia bank or any holding company that controls a Virginia bank, or (ii) the acquisition by a Virginia bank holding company of a bank or its holding company domiciled outside Virginia.
 
Source of Strength
 
FRB policy has historically required bank holding companies to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary banks. The Dodd-Frank Act codified this policy as a statutory requirement. Under this requirement, the Company is expected to commit resources to support the Bank, including at times when the Company may not be in a financial position to provide such resources. Any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to depositors and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary banks. In the event of a bank holding company's bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment.

Safety and Soundness
 
There are a number of obligations and restrictions imposed on bank holding companies and their subsidiary banks by law and regulatory policy that are designed to minimize potential loss to the depositors of such depository institutions and the FDIC insurance fund in the event of a depository institution insolvency, receivership or default. For example, under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991, to avoid receivership of an insured depository institution subsidiary, a bank holding company is required to guarantee the compliance of any subsidiary bank that may become "undercapitalized" with the terms of any capital restoration plan filed by such subsidiary with its appropriate federal bank regulatory agency up to the lesser of (i) an amount equal to 5% of the institution's total assets at the time the institution became undercapitalized or (ii) the amount that is necessary (or would have been necessary) to bring the institution into compliance with all applicable capital standards as of the time the institution fails to comply with such capital restoration plan.
 
Under the FDIA, the federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted guidelines prescribing safety and soundness standards. These guidelines establish general standards relating to capital management, internal controls and information systems, internal audit systems, data security, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, risk management, vendor management, corporate governance, asset growth, and compensation, fees and benefits. In general, the guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risk and exposures specified in the guidelines.
 
Prompt Corrective Action
 
The federal bank regulatory agencies possess broad powers to take prompt corrective action to resolve problems of insured depository institutions. The extent of these powers depends upon whether the institution is "well capitalized," "adequately capitalized," "undercapitalized," "significantly undercapitalized," or "critically undercapitalized," as defined by the law. "Well capitalized" institutions may generally operate without additional supervisory restriction. With respect to "adequately capitalized" institutions, such banks cannot normally pay dividends or make any capital contributions that would leave the bank undercapitalized; they cannot pay a management fee to a controlling person if after paying the fee, it would be undercapitalized; and they cannot accept, renew, or rollover any brokered deposit unless the bank has applied for and been granted a waiver by the FDIC.
 
Immediately upon becoming "undercapitalized," a depository institution becomes subject to the provisions of Section 38 of the FDIA, which: (i) restrict payment of capital distributions and management fees; (ii) require that the appropriate federal banking agency monitor the condition of the institution and its efforts to restore its capital; (iii) require submission of a capital restoration plan; (iv) restrict the growth of the institutionâ€™s assets; and (v) require prior approval of certain expansion proposals. The appropriate federal banking agency for an undercapitalized institution also may take any number of discretionary supervisory actions if the agency determines that any of these actions is necessary to resolve the problems of the institution at the least possible long-term cost to the DIF, subject in certain cases to specified procedures. These discretionary supervisory actions include: (i) requiring the institution to raise additional capital; (ii) restricting transactions with affiliates; (iii) requiring divestiture of the institution or the sale of the institution to a willing purchaser; and (iv) any other supervisory action that the agency deems appropriate. These and additional mandatory and permissive supervisory actions may be taken with respect to significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized institutions. Management believes, as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Bank met the requirements for being classified as "well capitalized."
 
Transactions with Affiliates
 
Pursuant to Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W, the authority of the Bank to engage in transactions with related parties or "affiliates" or to make loans to insiders is limited. Loan transactions with an affiliate generally must be collateralized and certain transactions between the Bank and its affiliates, including the sale of assets, the payment of money, or the provision of services, must be on terms and conditions that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the Bank, as those prevailing for comparable nonaffiliated transactions. In addition, the Bank generally may not purchase securities issued or underwritten by affiliates.
 
Loans to executive officers, directors or to any person who directly or indirectly, or acting through or in concert with one or more persons, owns, controls or has the power to vote more than 10% of any class of voting securities of a bank, are subject to Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and their corresponding regulations (Regulation O) and Section 13(k) of the Exchange Act relating to the prohibition on personal loans to executives (which exempts financial institutions in compliance with the insider lending restrictions of Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act). Among other things, these loans must be made on terms substantially the same as those prevailing on transactions made to unaffiliated individuals and certain extensions of credit to those persons must first be approved in advance by a disinterested majority of the entire board of directors. Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act prohibits loans to any of those individuals where the aggregate amount exceeds an amount equal to 15% of an institution's unimpaired capital and surplus plus an additional 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus in the case of loans that are fully secured by readily marketable collateral, or when the aggregate amount on all of the extensions of credit outstanding to all of these persons would exceed the Bank's unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. Section 22(g) of the Federal Reserve Act identifies limited circumstances in which the Bank is permitted to extend credit to executive officers.

Consumer Financial Protection
 
The Company is subject to a number of federal and state consumer protection laws that extensively govern its relationship with its customers. These laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Service Members Civil Relief Act, laws governing flood insurance, federal and state laws prohibiting unfair and deceptive business practices, foreclosure laws, and various regulations that implement some or all of the foregoing. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits, making loans, collecting loans and providing other services. If the Company fails to comply with these laws and regulations, it may be subject to various penalties. Failure to comply with consumer protection requirements may also result in failure to obtain any required bank regulatory approval for merger or acquisition transactions the Company may wish to pursue or being prohibited from engaging in such transactions even if approval is not required.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act centralized responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating a new agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the "CFPB"), and giving it responsibility for implementing, examining, and enforcing compliance with federal consumer protection laws. The CFPB focuses on (i) risks to consumers and compliance with the federal consumer financial laws, (ii) the markets in which firms operate and risks to consumers posed by activities in those markets, (iii) depository institutions that offer a wide variety of consumer financial products and services, and (iv) non-depository companies that offer one or more consumer financial products or services.
 
The CFPB has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer financial laws that apply to all banks, including, among other things, the authority to prohibit "unfair, deceptive or abusive" acts and practices. Abusive acts or practices are defined as those that materially interfere with a consumer's ability to understand a term or condition of a consumer financial product or service or take unreasonable advantage of a consumer's (i) lack of financial savvy, (ii) inability to protect himself in the selection or use of consumer financial products or services, or (iii) reasonable reliance on a covered entity to act in the consumer's interests. The CFPB can issue cease-and-desist orders against banks and other entities that violate consumer financial laws. The CFPB may also institute a civil action against an entity in violation of federal consumer financial law in order to impose a civil penalty or injunction. Further regulatory positions taken by the CFPB may influence how other regulatory agencies may apply the subject consumer financial protection laws and regulations.
 
Community Reinvestment Act
 
The CRA requires the appropriate federal banking agency, in connection with its examination of a bank, to assess the bank's record in meeting the credit needs of the communities served by the bank, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. Furthermore, such assessment is also required of banks that have applied, among other things, to merge or consolidate with or acquire the assets or assume the liabilities of an insured depository institution, or to open or relocate a branch. In the case of a BHC applying for approval to acquire a bank or BHC, the record of each subsidiary bank of the applicant BHC is subject to assessment in considering the application. Under the CRA, institutions are assigned a rating of "outstanding," "satisfactory," "needs to improve," or "substantial non-compliance." The Bank was rated "satisfactory" in its most recent CRA evaluation.
Anti-Money Laundering Legislation
 
The Company is subject to several federal laws that are designed to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and transactions with persons, companies or foreign governments designated by U.S. authorities ("AML laws"). This category of laws includes the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970, the Money Laundering Control Act of 1986, the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, and the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020.
 
The AML laws and their implementing regulations require insured depository institutions, broker-dealers, and certain other financial institutions to have policies, procedures, and controls to detect, prevent, and report money laundering and terrorist financing. The AML laws and their regulations also provide for information sharing, subject to conditions, between federal law enforcement agencies and financial institutions, as well as among financial institutions, for counter-terrorism purposes. Federal banking regulators are required, when reviewing bank holding company acquisition and bank merger applications, to take into account the effectiveness of the anti-money laundering activities of the applicants. To comply with these obligations, the Company has implemented appropriate internal practices, procedures, and controls.
 
Office of Foreign Assets Control
 
The U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC") is responsible for administering and enforcing economic and trade sanctions against specified foreign parties, including countries and regimes, foreign individuals and other foreign organizations and entities. OFAC publishes lists of prohibited parties that are regularly consulted by the Company in the conduct of its business in order to assure compliance. The Company is responsible for, among other things, blocking accounts of, and transactions with, prohibited parties identified by OFAC, avoiding unlicensed trade and financial transactions with such parties and reporting blocked transactions after their occurrence. Failure to comply with OFAC requirements could have serious legal, financial and reputational consequences for the Company.

Privacy Legislation
 
Several recent laws, including the Right to Financial Privacy Act, and related regulations issued by the federal bank regulatory agencies, also provide new protections against the transfer and use of customer information by financial institutions. A financial institution must provide to its customers information regarding its policies and procedures with respect to the handling of customers' personal information. Each institution must conduct an internal risk assessment of its ability to protect customer information. These privacy provisions generally prohibit a financial institution from providing a customer's personal financial information to unaffiliated parties without prior notice and approval from the customer.
Incentive Compensation
 
In June 2010, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of financial institutions do not undermine the safety and soundness of such institutions by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The Interagency Guidance on Sound Incentive Compensation Policies, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of a financial institutions, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a financial institution's incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the institution's ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the financial institution's board of directors.
 
Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act requires the federal banking agencies and the SEC to establish joint regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities that encourage inappropriate risk-taking by providing an executive officer, employee, director or principal shareholder with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits or that could lead to material financial loss to the entity. The federal banking agencies issued such proposed rules in March 2011 and issued a revised proposed rule in June 2016 implementing the requirements and prohibitions set forth in Section 956. The revised proposed rule would apply to all banks, among other institutions, with at least $1 billion in average total consolidated assets, like the Bank, for which it would go beyond the existing Interagency Guidance on Sound Incentive Compensation Policies to (i) prohibit certain types and features of incentive-based compensation arrangements for senior executive officers, (ii) require incentive-based compensation arrangements to adhere to certain basic principles to avoid a presumption of encouraging inappropriate risk, (iii) require appropriate board or committee oversight, (iv) establish minimum recordkeeping, and (v) mandate disclosures to the appropriate federal banking agency. The proposed rules have not yet been finalized.
 
The FRB will review, as part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of financial institutions, such as the Company, that are not "large, complex banking organizations." These reviews will be tailored to each financial institution based on the scope and complexity of the institution's activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. The findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination. Deficiencies will be incorporated into the institution's supervisory ratings, which can affect the institution's ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against a financial institution if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the institution's safety and soundness and the financial institution is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies. At December 31, 2021, the Company had not been made aware of any instances of non-compliance with the final guidance.

Mortgage Banking Regulation
 
In connection with making mortgage loans, the Bank is subject to rules and regulations that, among other things, establish standards for loan origination, prohibit discrimination, provide for inspections and appraisals of property, require credit reports on prospective borrowers, in some cases restrict certain loan features and fix maximum interest rates and fees, require the disclosure of certain basic information to mortgagors concerning credit and settlement costs, limit payment for settlement services to the reasonable value of the services rendered and require the maintenance and disclosure of information regarding the disposition of mortgage applications based on race, gender, geographical distribution and income level. The Bank is also subject to rules and regulations that require the collection and reporting of significant amounts of information with respect to mortgage loans and borrowers. The Bankâ€™s mortgage origination activities are subject to the FRBâ€™s Regulation Z, which implements the Truth in Lending Act. Certain provisions of Regulation Z require creditors to make a reasonable and good faith determination based on verified and documented information that a consumer applying for a mortgage loan has a reasonable ability to repay the loan according to its terms.
Cybersecurity
 
In March 2015, federal regulators issued two related statements regarding cybersecurity. One statement indicates that financial institutions should design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and to ensure that their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials, including security measures to reliably authenticate customers accessing internet-based services of the financial institution. The other statement indicates that a financial institution's management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid recovery, resumption and maintenance of the institution's operations after a cyber-attack involving destructive malware. A financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations and address rebuilding network capabilities and restoring data if the institution or its critical service providers fall victim to this type of cyber-attack. If the Company fails to observe the regulatory guidance, it could be subject to various regulatory sanctions, including financial penalties.

On November 18, 2021, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule, effective April 1, 2022, imposing new notification requirements for cybersecurity incidents. The rule requires financial institutions to notify their primary federal regulator as soon as possible and no later than 36 hours after the institution determines that a cybersecurity incident has occurred that has materially disrupted or degraded, or is reasonably likely to materially disrupt or degrade, the institutionâ€™s: (i) ability to carry out banking operations, activities, or processes, or deliver banking products and services to a material portion of its customer base, in the ordinary course of business, (ii) business line(s), including associated operations, services, functions, and support, that upon failure would result in a material loss of revenue, profit, or franchise value, or (iii) operations, including associated services, functions and support, as applicable, the failure or discontinuance of which would pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States.
 
To date, the Company has not experienced a significant compromise, significant data loss or any material financial losses related to cybersecurity attacks, but its systems and those of its customers and third-party service providers are under constant threat and it is possible that the Company could experience a significant event in the future. Risks and exposures related to cybersecurity attacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, as well as due to the expanding use of Internet banking, mobile banking and other technology-based products and services by the Company and its customers.
 
Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act and Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021
 
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act ("CARES Act") was signed into law on March 27, 2020 and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 ("Appropriations Act") was signed into law on December 27, 2020. Among other things, the CARES Act and Appropriations Act include the following provisions impacting financial institutions:

â€¢ | Community Bank Leverage Ratio. The CARES Act directed federal banking agencies to adopt interim final rules to lower the threshold under the CBLR from 9% to 8% and to provide a reasonable grace period for a community bank that falls below the threshold to regain compliance, in each case until the earlier of the termination date of the national emergency or December 31, 2020. In April 2020, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued two interim final rules implementing this directive. One interim final rule provided that, as of the second quarter 2020, banking organizations with leverage ratios of 8% or greater (and that meet the other existing qualifying criteria) may elect to use the CBLR framework. It also established a two-quarter grace period for qualifying community banking organizations whose leverage ratios fall below the 8% CBLR requirement, so long as the banking organization maintains a leverage ratio of 7% or greater. The second interim final rule provided a transition from the temporary 8% CBLR requirement to a 9% CBLR requirement. It established a minimum CBLR of 8% for the second through fourth quarters of 2020, 8.5% for 2021, and 9% thereafter, and established a two-quarter grace period for qualifying community banking organizations whose leverage ratios fall no more than 100 basis points below the applicable CBLR requirement. As of December 31, 2021, the Bank was a qualifying community banking organization, but elected not to measure capital adequacy under the CBLR framework.

â€¢ | Temporary Troubled Debt Restructurings Relief. The CARES Act allowed banks to elect to suspend requirements under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") for loan modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic (for loans that were not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019) that would otherwise be categorized as a troubled debt restructuring ("TDR"), including impairment for accounting purposes, until the earlier of 60 days after the termination date of the national emergency or December 31, 2020. Federal banking agencies are required to defer to the determination of the banks making such suspension. The Appropriations Act extended this temporary relief until January 1, 2022. The Company did not have any COVID-19 pandemic loan modifications as of December 31, 2021.

â€¢ | Small Business Administration Paycheck Protection Program. The CARES Act created the Small Business Administration ("SBA") Paycheck Protection Program ("PPP") and it was extended by the Appropriations Act. Under the PPP, money was authorized for small business loans to pay payroll and group health costs, salaries and commissions, mortgage and rent payments, utilities, and interest on other debt. The loans were provided through participating financial institutions, such as the Bank, that processed loan applications and service the loans.

Future Legislation and Regulation
 
Congress may enact legislation from time to time that affects the regulation of the financial services industry, and state legislatures may enact legislation from time to time affecting the regulation of financial institutions chartered by or operating in those states. Federal and state regulatory agencies also periodically propose and adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied. The substance or impact of pending or future legislation or regulation, or the application thereof, cannot be predicted, although enactment of the proposed legislation could affect the regulatory structure under which the Company and the Bank operate and may significantly increase costs, impede the efficiency of internal business processes, require an increase in regulatory capital, require modifications to business strategy, and limit the ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner. A change in statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to the Company or the Bank could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company and the Bank.

Effect of Governmental Monetary Policies
 
The Company's operations are affected not only by general economic conditions, but also by the policies of various regulatory authorities. In particular, the FRB regulates money and credit conditions and interest rates to influence general economic conditions. These policies have a significant impact on overall growth and distribution of loans, investments and deposits; they affect interest rates charged on loans or paid for time and savings deposits. FRB monetary policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks, including the Company, in the past and are expected to do so in the future. As a result, it is difficult for the Company to predict the potential effects of possible changes in monetary policies upon its future operating results.
Tax Reform
 
As a result of the enactment of the CARES Act in 2020, the Company recognized a tax benefit for the net operating loss ("NOL") five-year carryback provision for the NOL acquired in the HomeTown merger.
Human Capital Resources
 
At December 31, 2021, the Company employed 327 full-time persons and 44 part-time persons. In the opinion of the management of the Company, the relationship with employees of the Company and the Bank is good.
 
As a holding company for a community bank, the Company is a relationship-driven organization. A key aspect of the Companyâ€™s business strategy is for its senior officers to have primary contact with current and potential customers. The Companyâ€™s growth and development are in large part a result of these personalized relationships with the customer base. The success of the Company also often depends on its ability to hire and retain qualified banking officers. The Companyâ€™s senior officers have considerable experience in the banking industry and related financial services and are extremely valuable.
 
The Companyâ€™s senior officer compensation programs are designed to attract, retain and motivate bankers with the ability to generate strong business results and ensure the long-term success of the Company. The compensation committee of the Companyâ€™s board of directors has established compensation programs that reflect and support the Companyâ€™s strategic and financial performance goals, the primary goal being the creation of long-term value for the shareholders of the Company, while protecting the interests of the depositors of the Bank. In addition to competitive base and incentive compensation, the Company offers competitive benefits including paid vacation and sick leave, a 401(k) plan, health, dental, and vision plans, life and disability coverage, and a wellness plan. The Company has also entered into employment contracts with certain of its senior officers, and purchased key man life insurance policies to mitigate the risk of an unforeseen departure or death of certain of the senior officers.
 
In addition, the Companyâ€™s strategic plan has dedicated objectives and tactics to ensure it recruits, retains, and develops a diverse and talented team, with a specific focus on enhancing diversity, equity, and inclusion.

  COVID-19 Impact and Response

  In March 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 was recognized as a global pandemic. The spread of the virus has created a global health crisis that has resulted in unprecedented uncertainty, volatility and disruption in financial markets and in governmental, commercial and consumer activity in the United States and globally.  Governmental efforts in response to the outbreak in 2020 and 2021 have affected business operations and consumer activity.  The Company responded during the periods with measures to ensure employee and customer safety, maintain customer service levels, and continue operations while complying with applicable laws and regulations. Mid-2020, the Company implemented a business continuity plan and protocols to continue to maintain a high level of care for its employees, customers and communities. The Company also transitioned a majority of its non-branch employees to working remotely and assisting customers by appointment only in branches or directing them to drive-thrus or ATMs. It cancelled all business travel, and has held all Company meetings through virtual platforms. In the fall of 2021, branches were re-opened with safety protocols in place but were from time to time reverted back to appointment only or drive-thru only as Covid-19 circulated. The Company continues to maintain remote work options for a portion of its employees, continues to limit non-essential business travel and continues to hold meetings virtually. 

     The CARES Act which was signed into law March 27, 2020, provided for multiple programs to assist small businesses and consumers, including through the PPP. The bank regulatory agencies issued guidance allowing financial institutions to work with borrowers to make loan modifications to borrowers who were current prior to the pandemic, to not be treated as TDRs nor be considered past due. The Bank implemented a disaster assistance program which assisted customers with aggregrate loan balances of approximately $405.1 million outstanding during 2020. The majority of loans with deferrals resumed making normal payments prior to the end of 2020, with the remainder of the deferral periods ending in 2021. The Company processed a total of $364.2 million in PPP loans and had outstanding net PPP loans of $12.2 million at December 31, 2021 and $211.3 million at December 31, 2020.
