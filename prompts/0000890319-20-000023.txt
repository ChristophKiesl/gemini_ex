Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, even if new information becomes available in the future.
The Company
Taubman Centers, Inc. (TCO) is a Michigan corporation (incorporated in 1973) that operates as a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust (REIT). TCO's sole asset is an approximate 70% general partnership interest in The Taubman Realty Group Limited Partnership (TRG), which owns direct or indirect interests in all of our real estate properties. In this report, the terms "we", "us", and "our" refer to TCO, TRG, and/or TRG's subsidiaries as the context may require. See "Our UPREIT Structure" for additional information about our structure.
We own, manage, lease, acquire, dispose of, develop, and expand shopping centers and interests therein. Our owned portfolio of operating centers as of December 31, 2019 consisted of 24 urban and suburban shopping centers operating in 11 U.S. states, Puerto Rico, South Korea, and China. The Taubman Company LLC (the Manager) provides certain management and administrative services for us and for our U.S. properties. See "Personnel" below for more information about the Manager.
The Consolidated Businesses consist of shopping centers and entities that are controlled, through ownership or contractual agreements, by TRG, the Manager, or Taubman Properties Asia LLC and its subsidiaries and affiliates (Taubman Asia). Shopping centers owned through joint ventures that are not controlled by us but over which we have significant influence (Unconsolidated Joint Ventures or UJVs) are accounted for under the equity method. See "Item 2. Properties" for information regarding the shopping centers.
On February 9, 2020, TCO, TRG, Simon Property Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (Simon), Simon Property Group, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the Simon Operating Partnership), Silver Merger Sub 1, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of the Simon Operating Partnership (Merger Sub 1), and Silver Merger Sub 2, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of Merger Sub 1 (Merger Sub 2) (Merger Sub 2, Simon, the Simon Operating Partnership, and Merger Sub 1, referenced collectively as the Simon Parties), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement) pursuant to which, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, Merger Sub 2 will be merged with and into TRG (the Partnership Merger), and TCO will be merged with and into Merger Sub 1 (the REIT Merger) (the REIT Merger and the Partnership Merger, referenced collectively as the Mergers). Upon completion of the Partnership Merger, TRG will survive and the separate existence of Merger Sub 2 will cease. On completion of the REIT Merger, Merger Sub 1 will survive and the separate corporate existence of TCO will cease. Immediately following the Partnership Merger, TRG will be converted into a Delaware limited liability company. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the REIT Merger each share of our common stock then issued and outstanding, other than certain shares of excluded common stock (as set forth in the Merger Agreement), will be converted into the right to receive $52.50 in cash.

We expect to continue paying regular cash dividends on shares of our common and preferred stock until the completion of the Mergers (see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Dividends" for further information).
We expect the Mergers to close in mid-2020. Completion of the Mergers is, however, subject to various conditions, and it is possible that events or other circumstances could result in the Mergers being completed at a later time or not at all. In addition, the announcement of the proposed transaction may materially impact our ongoing relationships with our tenants, operating results, and business generally, and the proposed transaction may disrupt management’s attention from our ongoing business operations. For additional information regarding the Mergers or the Merger Agreement, see our other filings made with the SEC, including our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 11, 2020; in addition, see Part I - Item 1A - Risk Factors and Item 15 - Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 22 - Subsequent Event.

Our UPREIT Structure
We are structured as an umbrella partnership real estate investment trust, referred to as an UPREIT. In our UPREIT structure, TCO, which is a publicly-traded REIT, is the sole managing general partner of TRG. TCO's sole asset is its ownership of partnership interests in TRG (TRG Units), which constitute an approximate 70% economic interest in TRG as of December 31, 2019. The remaining approximate 30% of TRG Units are owned by TRG's partners other than TCO (Other Partners), including Robert S. Taubman, William S. Taubman, Gayle Taubman Kalisman, and the A. Alfred Taubman Restated Revocable Trust (Taubman Family). TRG owns direct or indirect interests in our real estate properties and in the companies that provide management services to us and our real estate properties, including in our UJVs and the Manager.
The following chart illustrates TCO's and TRG's structure:
Since TCO manages TRG as the sole managing general partner, the Other Partners have limited control rights in TRG in which they hold an economic interest. To provide the Other Partners with voting rights in TCO corresponding with their economic interests in TRG, in 1998, TCO issued, and made available for the Other Partners to purchase, Series B Non-Participating Convertible Preferred Stock (Series B Preferred Shares). The holders of the Series B Preferred Shares vote together with the holders of our common stock on all matters on which the common shareholders vote. Holders of our common stock and the Series B Preferred Shares are each entitled to one vote per share. 
Shares of TCO's common stock are held by TCO's public shareholders and represent, as of December 31, 2019, an approximate 70% voting interest in TCO, which corresponds with TCO's economic ownership of TRG. The Series B Preferred Shares represent, as of December 31, 2019, an approximate 30% voting interest in TCO, which corresponds with the Series B Preferred shareholders’ economic ownership in TRG. As of December 31, 2019, based on information contained in filings made with the SEC by members of the Taubman Family, members of the Taubman Family collectively held 92% of the outstanding Series B Preferred Shares, and collectively held an approximate 30% voting interest in TCO based on their ownership of TCO common stock and Series B Preferred Shares. For further information regarding the control rights of members of the Taubman Family, see "Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business and Industry - Members of the Taubman Family have the power to vote a significant number of the shares of Capital Stock entitled to vote and have contractual rights."

We operate as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). In order to satisfy the provisions of the Code applicable to REITs, we must distribute to our shareholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income prior to net capital gains and meet certain other requirements. TRG's partnership agreement provides that TRG will distribute, at a minimum, sufficient amounts to its partners such that our pro rata share will enable us to pay shareholder dividends (including capital gains dividends that may be required upon TRG's sale of an asset) that will satisfy the REIT provisions of the Code.
In 2017, the U.S. Congress passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (2017 Tax Act), which made significant changes to both corporate and individual tax rates and the resulting calculation of taxes, as well as international tax rules for U.S. domestic corporations. As a REIT, this legislation minimally changed the taxes we pay. However, it could impact the way in which our dividends are taxed on the holders of our stock.
Recent Developments
For a discussion of business developments that occurred in 2019, see "MD&A."
Business of TCO
We are engaged in the ownership, management, leasing, acquisition, disposition, development, and expansion of shopping centers and interests therein. We owned interests in 24 operating centers as of December 31, 2019. In the following discussion, the term "GLA" refers to gross retail space, including anchors and mall tenant areas, and the term "Mall GLA" refers to gross retail space, excluding anchors. The term "anchor" refers to a department store or other large retail store. The term "mall tenants" refers to stores (other than anchors) that lease space in shopping centers, including temporary tenants and specialty retailers.
As of December 31, 2019, the shopping centers:

• | are strategically located in major metropolitan areas, many in communities that are among the most affluent in the U.S. or Asia, including Denver, Detroit, Honolulu, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Miami, Naples, Nashville, New York City, Orlando, Salt Lake City, San Francisco, San Juan, Sarasota, Tampa, Washington, D.C., West Palm Beach, Hanam (South Korea), Xi'an (China), and Zhengzhou (China);


• | range in size between 238,000 and 1.7 million square feet of GLA and between 187,000 and 1.0 million square feet of Mall GLA, with an average of 1.0 million and 0.5 million square feet, respectively. The smallest center has approximately 60 stores, and the largest has over 300 stores with an average of approximately 150 stores per shopping center.


• | have approximately 3,400 stores operated by their mall tenants;


• | have 59 anchors, operating under 17 trade names;


• | primarily lease to national chains (U.S. centers only), including subsidiaries or divisions of H&M, The Gap (Gap, Gap Kids, Baby Gap, Banana Republic, Janie and Jack, Old Navy, Athleta, and others), Forever 21 (Forever 21 and XXI Forever), and Limited Brands (Bath & Body Works/White Barn Candle, Pink, Victoria's Secret, and others); and


• | are among the highest quality centers in the U.S. public regional mall industry as measured by our high portfolio average of mall tenants' sales per square foot. In 2019, our mall tenants at U.S. comparable centers reported average sales per square foot of $972.

The most important factor affecting the revenues generated by the centers is leasing to mall tenants (including temporary tenants and specialty retailers), which represents approximately 90% of revenues. Anchors account for less than 10% of revenues because many own their stores and, in general, those that lease their stores do so at rates substantially lower than those in effect for mall tenants.

Our portfolio is concentrated in highly productive shopping centers. All of our 24 owned centers have annualized rent rolls at December 31, 2019 of over $10 million. We believe that this level of productivity is indicative of the centers' strong competitive positions and is, in significant part, attributable to our business strategy and philosophy. We believe that our high-quality shopping centers are among the least susceptible to direct competition because, among other reasons, anchors and specialty retail stores do not find it economically attractive to open additional stores in the immediate vicinity of an existing location for fear of competing with themselves. We also believe that our centers' success can be attributed in part to their other characteristics, such as being well-designed with effective layouts, natural light, good physical condition, strong and evolving retail programming, state-of-the-art technology infrastructure, and other amenities. Many of our shopping centers are also strategically located in high-quality markets, with convenient access to a high density of customers, including significant tourist traffic.
Business Strategy and Philosophy
We believe that the shopping center business is not simply a real estate development business, but rather an operating business in which a retailing approach to the ongoing management and leasing of the centers is essential. Thus we:

• | offer retailers a location where they can have strong profitability. We believe leading retailers and emerging concepts choose to showcase their brand in the best markets and highest quality assets;


• | offer a large, diverse selection of retail stores and dining in each center to give customers a broad selection of consumer goods, food, and entertainment and a variety of price ranges;


• | endeavor to increase overall mall tenants' sales by leasing space to a regularly changing mix of tenants, thereby increasing rents over time;


• | seek to anticipate trends in our industry and emphasize ongoing introductions of new concepts into our centers. Due in part to this strategy, a number of successful retail trade names have opened their first mall stores in our centers. In addition, we have brought to the centers "new to the market" retailers and other retailers that previously served customers through online presences. We believe that the execution of this leasing strategy is an important element in building and maintaining customer loyalty and increasing mall productivity; and


• | provide innovative initiatives, including those that utilize technology and the internet, to increase revenues, enhance the shopping experience, personalize our relationship with shoppers, build customer loyalty, and increase mall tenant sales, with the following as examples:


• | we are continuing to invest in other synergistic digital capabilities and are a developer of the "Smart Mall" concept. Of the 24 shopping centers in our portfolio, 18 are considered to be "Smart Malls." This technology includes an upgraded fiber optic network throughout the centers, free shopper Wi-Fi, navigation and directory technology, advanced energy management, high-speed networking options for our tenants, new digital, mobile shopper engagement, and advanced shopper analytics;


• | our Taubman website program connects shoppers to each of our individual center brands through the internet. In 2019, we transitioned to a new, more efficient and scalable back end content management system that powers content on our websites, directories, and applications;


• | we have a robust email program reaching our most loyal customers weekly and our social media sites offer retailers and customers an immediate geo-targeted communication vehicle;


• | we actively manage a comprehensive social media program at 18 centers, delivering authentic local content which gained over 537 million social content impressions in 2019, an increase of nearly 20% year-over-year;


• | we deploy highly targeted digital media programs that leverage geographic and behavioral targeting to drive incremental visits from local and tourist customers;


• | we continue to install "smart parking" systems at some of our shopping centers, providing customers real-time information about parking availability, most convenient spots, and directions to their parked cars;


• | we have implemented rewards, loyalty, VIP, and incentive programs that provide exclusive benefits to designated shoppers leveraging a variety of technologies ranging from dedicated applications for VIPs to customer relationship management database marketing efforts; and

 5


• | we have added digital sponsorship screens within a number of centers, including high impact large screen LEDs at The Mall at Short Hills and at Beverly Center.

Our leasing strategy involves assembling a diverse and unique mix of mall tenants in each of the centers in order to attract customers, thereby generating higher sales by mall tenants. High sales by mall tenants make the centers attractive to prospective renewal and new tenants, thereby increasing the rental rates that current and prospective tenants are willing to pay. We have implemented an active leasing strategy to increase the centers' productivity and to set minimum rents at higher levels. Elements of this strategy include renegotiating existing leases and leasing space to prospective tenants that would enhance a center's retail mix. 
The shopping centers compete for retail consumer spending through diverse, in-depth presentations of predominantly fashion merchandise in an environment intended to facilitate customer shopping. Many of our centers include stores that target high-end customers, and such stores may also attract other retailers to come to the center. Each center is always individually merchandised in light of the demographics of its potential customers within convenient driving distance. When necessary, we consider rebranding existing shopping centers in order to maximize customer loyalty, maintain and increase mall tenant sales, and achieve greater profitability.
As our tenant mix continues to evolve to include tenants such as digitally native concepts and emerging brands, luxury, entertainment, restaurants, and fast fashion, increased tenant allowances have been, and may continue to be, provided to attract the best tenants to our centers. We believe bringing in great retailers will drive traffic and productivity to our centers, enhancing the long-term strategic position of each center.
Recent Trends in Retail
The U.S. shopping center industry has been challenged in recent years and is currently facing turbulence as it continues to evolve rapidly. Across the industry, department store sales have weakened and their ability to drive traffic has substantially decreased, resulting in increased store closures, with mature mall tenants and anchors rationalizing square footage and being highly selective in opening new stores. Bankruptcy filings by our mall tenants have recently been elevated, and included Forever 21, one of our largest mall tenants during the year ended December 31, 2019.
There has been some stabilization of the retail landscape recently; however, the retail headwinds still have the potential to be prolonged and ultimately may still result in many centers incurring lost or reduced rent, paying higher tenant allowances, and/or experiencing unscheduled terminations. 
The impact of e-commerce on shopping center retail has been steadily increasing. There have been secular changes in shopper behavior affecting how, where, and what consumers shop for. In addition, technology has intervened in the direct relationship between shoppers and the mall by enabling them to research, compare, and purchase products online easily, challenging our unique position as the main shopping portal within a trade area. 
 While challenging traditional retail in the shorter-term, e-commerce is also making high-quality brick-and-mortar assets more valuable, as retailers focus their real estate investments on the strongest assets. Successful retailers understand that a combination of both physical and digital channels is likely to best meet their customer needs. Physical locations are an important distribution channel that reduce order fulfillment and customer acquisition costs, while improving website traffic and brand recognition. Physical locations also allow for tenants to most successfully express their full brand statement, creating emotional connections to customers. We strive to position our assets to be desirable platforms for omni-channel retailers, believing technology improves the customer experience and will continue to do so, from the front of the house, logistics, efficiency, pricing, customer acquisition, customer knowledge and service. 
Over time we believe high-quality mall portfolios such as ours will continue to gain market share of mall tenant sales and rents. We expect to achieve this because brick-and-mortar remains the heart of omni-channel retailing. Our high-quality portfolio of shopping centers complements retailers' strategies by positioning their brands among high-end, productive retailers in the best markets. As an upscale, niche player in our industry, most of our assets have a unique value proposition in their respective markets for tenants and consumers - it's estimated that nearly 80% of our malls are ranked number one or two in their markets. They remain critical brick-and-mortar locations for retail brands and important destinations for shoppers. This is a strength of our assets that represents a key advantage against our larger competitors in our industry.

Apparel retailers, traditionally a dominant category for malls, had been facing particularly challenging times in recent years, however there has been recent momentum in the category, and apparel retail sales have increased in both 2018 and 2019. While it is prudent to continuously adjust the use of space in order to broaden the mall experience, we believe that the rebound of apparel is further evidence that the dramatic reallocation of in-line space to other tenants across the board for the sake of reducing exposure to apparel is neither economically sustainable nor strategically necessary. However, we have seen the emergence of a new tenant pool offering additional entertainment and coworking alternatives within the mall. We continue to expect that additional dining, entertainment, digitally native concepts, grocery, fitness, events, coworking and other new uses over time will gain a larger allocation of space alongside a significant presence of apparel, encouraging more shopping destination trips and strengthening high-quality malls as social hubs in their communities.
Throughout the industry, traditional department stores have been experiencing declining sales and market shares. As a result, some department stores have been pursuing strategies of consolidation and/or closure of under-performing locations. Given the overall quality of our real estate, however, many of our department stores have been performing comparatively well. As a result, we do not expect that we will have as many opportunities as others in our industry to reacquire and re-purpose anchor locations, with department stores often being reluctant to exit our malls. However, in the event of anchor closures, we generally expect re-purposing of anchors to add value strategically and be accretive financially.
Potential For Growth
Our principal objective is to enhance shareholder value. We seek to maximize the financial results of our core assets, while also pursuing a growth strategy that includes redevelopment of existing centers as well as a new center development program. With limited opportunities for new development in the U.S., our emphasis will now be on strengthening and growing our core assets and executing our redevelopments. We continue to invest for the future and are creating value in our centers that is intended to lead to sustained growth for our shareholders. Our internally generated funds and distributions from operating centers and other investing activities (including strategic dispositions of centers or a portion of our interests therein), augmented by use of our existing revolving lines of credit, provide resources to maintain our current operations and assets, pay dividends, and fund a portion of our major capital investments. We pursue an overall strategy of creating value and recycling capital using long-term fixed rate financing on the centers upon stabilization. Excess proceeds from refinancings, if any, typically are used to reinvest in our business. Generally, our need to access the capital markets is limited to refinancing debt obligations at or near maturity and funding major capital investments. From time to time, we also may sell interests in shopping centers or, in limited circumstances, access the equity markets, to raise additional funds or refinance existing obligations on a strategic basis, including using excess proceeds therefrom.
Internal Growth
As noted in "Business Strategy and Philosophy" above in detail, our core business strategy is to maintain a portfolio of properties that deliver above-market profitable growth by providing targeted retailers with the best opportunity to do business in each market and targeted shoppers with the best local shopping experience for their needs.
We continue to expect that over time a significant portion of our future growth will come from our existing core portfolio and business. We have always had and will continue to have a culture of intensively managing our assets and maximizing the rents from mall tenants over the long term as this is a key growth driver going forward.
Another element of our internal growth over time is the strategic expansion and redevelopment of existing properties to update and enhance their market positions by adding, replacing, re-tenanting, or otherwise re-merchandising the use of anchor space, increasing mall tenant space, or rebranding centers. Most of the centers have been designed to accommodate expansions. Expansion projects can be as significant as new shopping center construction in terms of scope and cost, requiring governmental and existing anchor store approvals, design and engineering activities, including rerouting utilities, providing additional parking areas or decking, acquiring additional land, and relocating anchors and mall tenants (all of which must take place with minimum disruption to existing tenants and customers).
We substantially completed our redevelopment project at Beverly Center in November 2018, which included a complete renovation and significant re-merchandising, including transformation of food offerings. We also substantially completed our redevelopment project at The Mall at Green Hills in 2019, which will ultimately add approximately 170,000 square feet of incremental GLA to the center. 
 7

We also look to monetize our common areas through robust specialty leasing and sponsorship programs. About 8% of our 2019 comparable center Net Operating Income (NOI) was generated from such programs. In the past five years, comparable center NOI from leasing and sponsorship programs has ranged from 8% to 9%. Examples found in our centers include destination holiday experiences, customer service programs, sponsored children's play areas, and turnkey attractions. In addition, we monetize our common areas through static and digital media that comes in a variety of formats.
External Growth
We pursue various areas of external growth, including traditional center development in the U.S., new opportunities in Asia, and acquisitions in both the U.S. and Asia. We have invested in a development project, Starfield Anseong, in South Korea for which we have formed an additional joint venture with Shinsegae Group (Shinsegae). Additionally, we opened CityOn.Zhengzhou in China in 2017. We continue to evaluate various development and acquisition possibilities for additional new centers. 
Development of New U.S. Centers
Throughout our history, a critical element of our success has been the ground-up development of new shopping centers. Given the over saturation of suburban retail in the U.S., almost no new supply of suburban malls is expected within the foreseeable future. Current trends suggest that any future new supply of malls will likely be limited and in the format of mixed-use or destination projects. We do expect expansions of high-quality malls will continue as lower quality centers atrophy, and we will pro-actively pursue the re-purposing of anchors where appropriate (see "Internal Growth" above). We do not anticipate significant new ground-up developments.
While we will continue to evaluate potential future U.S. development projects using criteria, including financial criteria for rates of return, similar to those employed in the past, no assurances can be given that the adherence to these criteria will produce comparable or projected results in the future. In addition, the costs of shopping center development opportunities that are explored but ultimately abandoned will, to some extent, diminish the overall return on development projects taken as a whole. See "MD&A – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Capital Spending" for further discussion of our development activities.
Miami Worldcenter is a large, mixed-use, urban development currently under construction in Miami, Florida. Miami Worldcenter's master developer, Miami Worldcenter Associates, is pursuing a high street retail plan as a part of their master development of the site. We have agreed with Miami Worldcenter Associates on terms for a co-leasing services agreement with The Forbes Company for the retail portion of the street level project, with an option to purchase the retail component at a favorable price once it opens.
Asia
We are pursuing a development strategy in Asia to:

• | provide additional growth through exposure to countries that have more rapidly growing gross domestic products;


• | utilize our expertise, including leasing/retailer relationships, design/development expertise, and operational/marketing skills; and


• | take advantage of a generational opportunity, as the demand for high-quality retail is early to mid-cycle, there is significant deal flow, and it diversifies longer-term growth investment opportunities.

Taubman Asia is responsible for our operations and development in the Asia-Pacific region, focusing on China and South Korea. We have pursued a strategy of seeking strategic partners to jointly develop high-quality malls in our areas of focus. Taubman Asia is engaged in projects that leverage our strong retail planning, design, and operational capabilities with our strategic partners being responsible for acquiring and entitling the land and leading construction. 
We envision that the Asia business will be a smaller but complementary and important part of our overall business. We have built three high-quality shopping centers and a fully integrated development and management platform with strategic, local partners. Our goal is to create a platform that finances itself by bringing in new capital partners, and potentially adding additional operating partners where appropriate, to create a less capital-intensive business that can grow the asset base with improved returns on equity, which is evidenced by our agreement in February 2019 with The Blackstone Group L.P. (Blackstone) to sell 50% of our interests in Starfield Hanam, CityOn.Xi'an, and CityOn.Zhengzhou described below.
 8

As part of our Asia strategy, we look to mitigate our operating costs through property management fees and third party service contracts when possible. We currently provide some management and advisory services to third parties in Asia. We also attempt to manage risks and financial returns for our Asia developments through actively managing and limiting pre-construction costs, ensuring there is adequate anchor and tenant interest in the project prior to construction, and pursuing initial projects that are already fully entitled with partners having appropriate expertise in land acquisition and local regulatory issues. Developments in China and South Korea are subject to income taxes and taxes upon repatriation of earnings that also must be planned for and managed.
We have a joint venture with Shinsegae, one of South Korea's largest retailers, to build, lease, own, and manage Starfield Anseong, an approximately 1.1 million square foot shopping center, in Anseong, Gyeonggi Province, South Korea. We own a 49% interest in the project, which is scheduled to open in late 2020. We also have an additional joint venture with Shinsegae that owns and manages an approximately 1.7 million square foot shopping center, Starfield Hanam, in Hanam, South Korea. Additionally, we have two joint ventures with Wangfujing Group Co., Ltd (Wangfujing), one of China's largest department store chains, that own CityOn.Xi'an and CityOn.Zhengzhou in China. 
In February 2019, we announced agreements to sell 50% of our interests in Starfield Hanam, CityOn.Xi’an, and CityOn.Zhengzhou to funds managed by Blackstone (Blackstone Transactions). In September 2019, we completed the sale of 50% of our interest in Starfield Hanam and now own 17.15% of the center. Additionally, in December 2019, we completed the sale of 50% of our interest in CityOn.Zhengzhou and now own 24.5% of the center. We expect to close on the sale of 50% of our interest in CityOn.Xi'an in the first quarter of 2020, and following the sale of 50% of our interest, we will own 25% of CityOn.Xi'an. We remain the partner responsible for the joint management of the three shopping centers, with Blackstone paying a property service fee. 
See "MD&A - Results of Operations - Taubman Asia" for further details regarding the Blackstone Transactions and our activities in Asia.
Strategic Acquisitions
We expect attractive opportunities to acquire existing centers, or interests in existing centers, from other companies may be scarce and expensive. However, we continue to look for assets in both the U.S. and Asia where we can add significant value or that would be strategic to the rest of our portfolio. Our objective is to acquire existing centers only when they are compatible with the quality of our portfolio, or can be redeveloped to that level. We also may acquire additional interests in centers currently in our portfolio.
In April 2019, we acquired a 48.5% interest in The Gardens Mall in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida in exchange for 1.5 million newly issued TRG Units. The Forbes Company, our partner in The Mall at Millenia and Waterside Shops, also owns a 48.5% interest and manages and leases the center. This purchase is consistent with our strategy to own high-quality, dominant assets in great markets. See "MD&A - Results of Operations - The Gardens Mall Acquisition" for additional information regarding the acquisition.
Redevelopment Agreement for Taubman Prestige Outlets Chesterfield
In May 2018, we entered into a redevelopment agreement for Taubman Prestige Outlets Chesterfield, and all operations at the center, as well as the building and improvements, were transferred to The Staenberg Group (TSG). TSG leases the land from us through a long-term, participating ground lease and we receive ground lease payments and a share of the property’s revenues above a specified level. TSG is planning a significant redevelopment of the property, which will transform it into a unique entertainment, shopping and dining destination. We have the right to terminate the ground lease in the event that the redevelopment has not begun within five years, with the buildings and improvements reverting to us upon termination. We have deferred recognition of a sale until our termination right is no longer available, with the right ceasing upon TSG commencing construction of a redevelopment. TSG has made significant progress on its redevelopment plans and the commencement of construction is probable within the year, leading to an expected sale of the property in 2020. Accordingly, the center was classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2019 and an impairment charge of $72.2 million was recognized in the fourth quarter, which reduced the book value of the buildings, improvements, and equipment that were transferred to zero. See "MD&A - Results of Operations - Redevelopment Agreement for Taubman Prestige Outlets Chesterfield" for further details regarding the redevelopment agreement and impairment charge.

Rental Rates
As leases have expired in the centers, we have generally been able to rent the available space, either to the existing tenant or a new tenant, at rental rates that are higher than those of the expired leases. Generally, center revenues have increased as older leases rolled over or were terminated early and replaced with new leases negotiated at current rental rates that were usually higher than the average rates for existing leases. In periods of increasing sales, rents on new leases will generally tend to rise. In periods of slower growth or declining sales, rents on new leases will generally grow more slowly or will decline, as occurred in 2019, or we may execute shorter lease terms, as tenants' expectations of future growth become less optimistic. Where appropriate, we are making decisions as we re-tenant space to use some shorter term leases in order to maintain occupancy, merchandising, and preserve cash flow; this activity can have a material impact on our releasing spread for an applicable period. See "Risk Factors" for further information.
The following table contains certain information regarding average rent per square foot of our Consolidated Businesses and UJVs at the comparable centers (centers that had been owned and open for the current and preceding year, excluding centers impacted by significant redevelopment activity, as well as The Mall of San Juan due to the impact of Hurricane Maria). Comparable center statistics for 2019 and 2018 exclude Beverly Center, The Gardens Mall, The Mall of San Juan, and Taubman Prestige Outlets Chesterfield. Average rent per square foot statistics are computed using contractual rentals per the tenant lease agreements (excluding lease cancellation income, expense recoveries, and uncollectible tenant revenues), which reflect any lease modifications, including those for rental concessions.

(1) | Excludes rents from temporary in-line tenants and centers not open and operating at December 31, 2019.


(2) | In addition to tenants with spaces 10,000 square feet or less, includes tenants with spaces over 10,000 square feet and value and outlet center anchors. Excludes rents from mall anchors and temporary in-line tenants.


(3) | Weighted average of the annualized contractual rent per square foot as of the end of the reporting period.


(4) | Excludes leases that expire in 2020 for which renewal leases or leases with replacement tenants have been executed as of December 31, 2019.

We believe that the information in the table is not necessarily indicative of what will occur in the future, partially due to early lease terminations at the centers. The average remaining term of the leases that were terminated during the last five years was approximately 1.5 years. The average term of leases signed was approximately six and seven years during 2019 and 2018, respectively, excluding temporary in-line tenants (TILs).
In addition, mall tenants at the centers may seek the protection of the bankruptcy laws, which could result in the termination of such tenants' leases and thus cause a reduction in cash flow. In 2019, tenants representing 2.7% of the total number of tenant leases filed for bankruptcy during the year compared to 1.6% in 2018. In 2019, bankruptcy filings included Forever 21, one of our largest mall tenants during the year ended December 31, 2019. This statistic has ranged from 0.8% to 3.1% of leases per year over the last five years. However, many bankruptcies do not ultimately impact our occupancy because historically less than half of our tenants who file for bankruptcy actually close.

Competition
There are numerous shopping facilities that compete with our properties in attracting retailers to lease space. We compete with other major real estate investors with significant capital for attractive investment opportunities. We also compete with online retailers as they draw sales away from our tenants or reduce sales attributed to their stores in our centers, which impacts rental rates. See "Risk Factors" for further details of our competitive business.
Seasonality
The shopping center industry in the U.S. is seasonal in nature, with mall tenant sales highest in the fourth quarter due to the Christmas season, and with lesser, though still significant, sales fluctuations associated with the Easter holiday and back-to-school period. See "MD&A – Seasonality" for further discussion.
Environmental Matters
See "Risk Factors" regarding discussion of environmental matters.
Personnel
The Manager provides real estate management, acquisition, development, leasing, and administrative services required by us and our properties in the United States, and employs all of our U.S. employees, including our executive officers. Taubman Asia Management Limited (TAM) and certain other affiliates provide similar services for third parties in China and South Korea as well as Taubman Asia. The Manager is 99.8% beneficially owned by TRG and 0.2% owned by Taub-Co Holdings LLC (Taub-Co), which is 100% owned by members of the Taubman Family. The Manager receives fees from the shopping centers, TCO, TRG, and their respective affiliates and third parties in exchange for the performance of its services. Since TRG has an approximate 99.8% beneficial interest in the Manager, substantially all of these fees accrue to TRG, with a de minimis portion of the fees accruing to the benefit of Taub-Co through its 0.2% beneficial interest in the Manager. For more information about the Manager, see "Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business and Industry - Members of the Taubman Family have the power to vote a significant number of the shares of Capital Stock entitled to vote and have contractual rights."
As of December 31, 2019, the Manager, TAM, and certain other affiliates had 420 full time employees.
