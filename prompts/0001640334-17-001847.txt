ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Business Overview
 
On March 6, 2015 the Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada and established a fiscal year end of May 31. Initially the business platform was in providing application software to a global vendor platform to connect people to businesses and provide a new shopping experience. The Company’s previous principal offices are located in 73B Bank Avenue, Amritsar, Punjab, 143001, India.
 
On May 18, 2017, Lakwinder Singh Sidhu, the Company’s former Director and CEO, completed a transaction with New Reap Global Ltd., by which New Reap Global Ltd., acquired 32,500,000 shares of common stock, representing 68.4% ownership of the Company. After the change ownership, the Company’s current principal offices are located in Travessa do Cais, No 3A, Edg. Kai Lei, Macau.
 
The Company has not yet implemented its initial and new business model and to date has generated no revenues. It is the Company's intention to provide vendor tools technology. The proposed planned platform connects businesses to consumers based on location and preferences for products and services. Consumers received promotions while they are travelling via their smartphone. Vendors can send promotions and special offers simply through the web. When the consumer goes to the vendor's location, they can redeem the promotion through their smartphone allowing the proposed platform to keep track of performance analytics. SavMobi's proposed Mobile Marketing Platform intends to help businesses by bringing customers into their door and increasing sales.
 
Initially we intend to develop and deliver application Mobile Marketing Platform, containing the Vendor Center and Mobile Apps. The Vendor Center intends to allow SavMobi vendors to manage and monitor their promos. It is at the proposed core of all SavMobi Vendor Services. SavMobi Members can use the mobile apps to receive, view & redeem promos, set their preferences, and discover new vendors in their area. 
 
Every business is different, so we've giving the Vendor the ability to determine the discount or offer what is appropriate for them. 
 
The proposed SavMobi Mobile Apps intends to provide members with the full consumer experience of the proposed Mobile Marketing Platform. Members can use the mobile apps to receive, view & redeem promos, set their preferences, and discover new vendors in their area. 
 
We have focused our current operations on the organization and development of our business plan. Our business plan is intended to design and to create a targeted and organized approach to building our intended Vendor and Member enrollment. We believe that once the proposed development of SavMobi's Mobile Marketing Platform is completed, this will allow SavMobi to hit the ground running with many options for our proposed customers.
 
After the change in control of management, the Company is phasing out the initial business plan and has now shifted the business operation of the Company outsourced accounting and bookkeeping services for its clients. Under this revised business plan, the Company will receive a monthly retainer fee from its clients and has cautiously projected this will have a positive cashflow and generate profit to the Company.

Industry Analysis/Competition
 
Market Analysis

Current management plans to maintain some of the technological advantages of the previous business platform, but to utilize these features in providing accounting and bookkeeping services, specified towards start-ups, small and medium size businesses, corporations and public listed companies.

Competition 
 
Cited by over 70% of respondents, attracting and developing new business is the top challenge for accounting and financial services firms. This is in line with a trend across the professional services industries. In many market segments, it’s growing more and more challenging to generate new clients. The competition is fierce.
 
Demand for accounting services depends on new business formations, the increasing complexity of corporate business, and personal income. The profitability of individual firms depends on the right mix of services and effective marketing. Large firms have advantages in providing wider ranges of services to large corporate clients and having the resources to serve customers with many locations. However, small firms can also compete effectively by specializing and providing superior service. 
 
In a study conducted by The Sleeter Group, 85% of small business owners surveyed said they want their accountant to help them be more proactive in helping them find and use technologies that can help their business become more productive. And 76% reported that their current accountant wasn’t being proactive enough. Nearly half (47%) reported they had changed their accounting firm in the past, at least in part because the firm only provided responsive services. 
 
Patent and Trademarks
 
We do no currently own any domestic or foreign patents relating to our initial proposed Mobile Marketing Platform and current new plan on accounting and bookkeeping services business.
Employees
