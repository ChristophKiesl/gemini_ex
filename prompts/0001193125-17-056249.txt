 Description of Business 
 Landstar is a worldwide asset-light provider of integrated transportation management solutions. The Company offers services to its customers across multiple transportation modes, with the ability to arrange for individual shipments of freight to enterprise-wide solutions to manage all of a customers transportation needs. Landstar provides services principally throughout the United States and to a lesser extent in Canada, and between the United States and Canada, Mexico and other countries around the world. The Companys services emphasize safety, information coordination and customer service and are delivered through a network of independent commission sales agents and third party capacity providers linked together by a series of technological applications which are provided and coordinated by the Company. The nature of the Companys business is such that a significant portion of its operating costs varies directly with revenue. 
 Landstar markets its integrated transportation management solutions primarily through independent commission sales agents and exclusively utilizes third party capacity providers to transport customers freight. Landstars independent commission sales agents enter into contractual arrangements with the Company and are responsible for locating freight, making that freight available to Landstars capacity providers and coordinating the transportation of the freight with customers and capacity providers. The Companys third party capacity providers consist of independent contractors who provide truck capacity to the Company under exclusive lease arrangements (the BCO Independent Contractors), unrelated trucking companies who provide truck capacity to the Company under non-exclusive contractual arrangements (the Truck Brokerage Carriers), air cargo carriers, ocean cargo carriers and railroads. Through this network of agents and capacity providers linked together by Landstars information technology systems, Landstar operates an integrated transportation management solutions business primarily throughout North America with revenue of $3.2 billion during the most recently completed fiscal year. The Company reports the results of two operating segments: the transportation logistics segment and the insurance segment.

Transportation Logistics Segment 
 The transportation logistics segment provides a wide range of integrated transportation management solutions. Transportation services offered by the Company include truckload and less-than-truckload transportation, rail intermodal, air cargo, ocean cargo, expedited ground and air delivery of time-critical freight, heavy-haul/specialized, U.S.-Canada and U.S.-Mexico cross-border, project cargo and customs brokerage. Examples of the industries serviced by the transportation logistics segment include automotive products, building products, metals, chemicals, foodstuffs, heavy machinery, retail, electronics, ammunition and explosives and military equipment. In addition, the transportation logistics segment provides transportation services to other transportation companies, including third party logistics and less-than-truckload service providers. Each of the independent commission sales agents has the opportunity to market all of the services provided by the transportation logistics segment. Billings for freight transportation services are typically charged to customers on a per shipment basis for the physical transportation of freight and are referred to as transportation revenue. See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the amount of revenue from external customers, measure of profit and total assets attributable to the transportation logistics segment for the last three fiscal years. 
 Truck Services. The transportation logistics segments truck transportation services include a full array of truckload transportation for a wide range of commodities and, to a lesser degree, less-than-truckload transportation services. A significant portion of the Companys truckload services are delivered in the spot market over irregular or non-repetitive routes, while approximately 32% of the Companys fiscal year 2016 truck transportation revenue was provided utilizing Landstar provided trailing equipment, which frequently are used on more routine, regular routes. The Company utilizes a broad assortment of equipment, including dry and specialty vans of various sizes, unsided/platform trailers (including flatbeds, drop decks and specialty trailers), temperature-controlled vans and containers. Available truck transportation services also include short-to-long haul movement of containers by truck and expedited ground and dedicated power-only truck capacity. During fiscal year 2016, revenue generated by BCO Independent Contractors and Truck Brokerage Carriers was 47% and 46%, respectively, of consolidated revenue. Also, during fiscal year 2016, truck transportation revenue generated via van equipment and unsided/platform trailing equipment was 65% and 33%, respectively, of truck transportation revenue and less-than-truckload revenue was 3% of truck transportation revenue. The Companys truck services contributed 93% of consolidated revenue in each of fiscal years 2016 and 2015 and 94% of consolidated revenue in fiscal year 2014. 
 Rail Intermodal Services. The transportation logistics segment has contracts with Class 1 domestic and Canadian railroads, certain short-line railroads and most major asset-based intermodal equipment providers, including agreements with stacktrain operators and container and trailing equipment companies. In addition, the transportation logistics segment has contracts with a vast network of local trucking companies that handle pick-up and delivery of rail freight. These contracts provide the transportation logistics segment the ability to transport freight via rail throughout the United States, Canada and Mexico. The transportation logistics segments rail intermodal service capabilities include trailer on flat car, container on flat car, box car and railcar. The transportation logistics segments rail intermodal services contributed 3% of consolidated revenue in each of fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014. 
 Air and Ocean Services. The transportation logistics segment provides domestic and international air services and ocean services to its customers. The Company executes international air freight transportation as an International Air Transport Association (IATA) certified Indirect Air Carrier (IAC) and international ocean freight transportation as an Ocean Transportation Intermediary (OTI) licensed by the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC) as a non-vessel operating common carrier (NVOCC) and ocean freight forwarder. Through its network of independent commission sales agents, relationships within a global network of foreign freight forwarders and contracts with a number of airlines and ocean lines, the transportation logistics segment provides efficient and cost effective door-to-door transportation to most points in the world for a vast array of cargo types such as over-sized break bulk, consolidations, full container loads and refrigerated freight. The transportation logistics segments air and ocean services contributed 2% of consolidated revenue in fiscal year 2016, 3% of consolidated revenue in fiscal year 2015 and 2% of consolidated revenue in fiscal year 2014. 
Insurance Segment 
 The insurance segment is comprised of Signature, a wholly owned offshore insurance subsidiary, and RMCS. This segment provides risk and claims management services to certain of Landstars Operating Subsidiaries. In addition, it reinsures certain risks of the Companys BCO Independent Contractors and provides certain property and casualty insurance directly to certain of Landstars Operating Subsidiaries. Revenue at the insurance segment represents reinsurance premiums from third party insurance companies that provide insurance programs to BCO Independent Contractors where all or a portion of the risk of loss is ultimately borne by Signature. Revenue at the insurance segment represented approximately 1% of the Companys consolidated revenue in each of fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014. See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the amount of revenue from external customers, measure of profit and total assets attributable to the insurance segment for the last three fiscal years.

Factors Significant to the Companys Operations 
 Management believes the following factors are particularly significant to the Companys operations: 
 Agent Network 
 The Companys primary day-to-day contact with its customers is through its network of independent commission sales agents and, to a lesser extent, through employees of the Company. The typical Landstar independent commission sales agent maintains a relationship with a number of shippers and services these shippers utilizing the Companys information technology systems and the various modes of transportation made available through the Companys network of third party capacity providers. The Company provides assistance to the agents in developing additional relationships with shippers and enhancing agent and Company relationships with larger shippers through the Companys field employees, located throughout the United States and Canada. The Operating Subsidiaries provide programs to support the agents operations and provide guidance on establishing pricing parameters for freight hauled by the various modes of transportation available to the agents. It is important to note that the Operating Subsidiaries, and not the Companys agents, contract directly with customers and generally assume the related credit risk and potential liability for freight losses or damages when the Company is providing transportation services as a motor carrier. 
 Management believes the Company has more independent commission sales agents than any other asset-light integrated transportation management solutions company in the United States. Landstars vast network of independent commission sales agent locations provides the Company regular contact with shippers at the local level and the capability to be highly responsive to shippers changing needs. The Companys large fleet of available capacity provides the agent network the resources needed to service both large and small shippers. Through its agent network, the Company offers smaller shippers a level of service comparable to that typically enjoyed only by larger customers. Examples include the ability to provide transportation services on short notice, multiple pick-up and delivery points, electronic data interchange capability and access to specialized equipment. In addition, a number of the Companys agents specialize in certain types of freight and transportation services (such as oversized or heavy loads and/or rail, air and international freight transportation). Each independent commission sales agent has the opportunity to market all of the services provided by the transportation logistics segment. 
 The independent commission sales agents use a variety of proprietary and third party information technology applications provided by the Company to service the requirements of shippers. For truckload services, the Companys independent commission sales agents use Landstar proprietary software which enables agents to enter available freight, dispatch capacity and process most administrative procedures and then communicate that information to Landstar and its capacity providers via the internet. The Companys web-based available truck information system provides a listing of available truck capacity to the Companys independent commission sales agents. For modes of transportation other than truckload, the independent commission sales agents utilize both proprietary and third party information technology applications provided by the Company. 
 Commissions to agents are based on contractually agreed-upon percentages of revenue or net revenue, defined as revenue less the cost of purchased transportation, or net revenue less a contractually agreed upon percentage of revenue retained by Landstar. Commissions to agents as a percentage of consolidated revenue will vary directly with fluctuations in the percentage of consolidated revenue generated by the various modes of transportation and reinsurance premiums and with changes in net revenue margin, defined as net revenue divided by revenue, on services provided by Truck Brokerage Carriers, railroads, air cargo carriers and ocean cargo carriers. Commissions to agents are recognized upon the completion of freight delivery. 
 The Company had 502 and 512 agents who each generated at least $1 million in Landstar revenue during fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively, (the Million Dollar Agents). Landstar revenue from the Million Dollar Agents in the aggregate represented 92% of consolidated revenue in both fiscal years 2016 and 2015. Annually, the Company has experienced very few terminations of its Million Dollar Agents, whether such terminations are initiated by the agent or the Company. Annual terminations of Million Dollar Agents are typically 3% or less of the total number of Million Dollar Agents. Management believes that the majority of the Million Dollar Agents choose to represent the Company exclusively. 
 Third Party Capacity 
 The Company relies exclusively on independent third parties for its hauling capacity other than for trailing equipment owned or leased by the Company and utilized primarily by the BCO Independent Contractors. These third party transportation capacity providers consist of BCO Independent Contractors, Truck Brokerage Carriers, air and ocean cargo carriers and railroads. 
 
5 
 
 Landstars use of capacity provided by third parties allows it to maintain a lower level of capital investment, resulting in lower fixed costs. During fiscal year 2016, revenue generated by BCO Independent Contractors, Truck Brokerage Carriers and railroads represented approximately 47%, 46% and 3%, respectively, of the Companys consolidated revenue. Historically, with the exception of 2015, annual revenue generated by BCO Independent Contractors has exceeded annual revenue generated by Truck Brokerage Carriers. Collectively, revenue generated by air and ocean cargo carriers represented approximately 2% of the Companys consolidated revenue during fiscal year 2016. Historically, the gross profit margin (defined as gross profit, which is defined as revenue less the cost of purchased transportation and commissions to agents, divided by revenue) generated from freight hauled by BCO Independent Contractors has been greater than that from freight hauled by other third party capacity providers. However, the Companys insurance and claims costs, depreciation costs and other operating costs are incurred primarily in support of BCO Independent Contractor capacity. In addition, as further described in the Corporate Services section that follows, the Company incurs significantly higher selling, general and administrative costs in support of BCO Independent Contractor capacity as compared to the other modes of transportation. Purchased transportation costs are recognized upon the completion of freight delivery. 
 BCO Independent Contractors. Management believes the Company has the largest fleet of truckload BCO Independent Contractors in the United States. BCO Independent Contractors provide truck capacity to the Company under exclusive lease arrangements. Each BCO Independent Contractor operates under the motor carrier operating authority issued by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) to Landstars Operating Subsidiary to which such BCO Independent Contractor provides services and has leased his or her equipment. The Companys network of BCO Independent Contractors provides marketing, operating, safety, recruiting and retention advantages to the Company. 
 The Companys BCO Independent Contractors are compensated primarily based on a contractually agreed-upon percentage of revenue generated by loads they haul. This percentage generally ranges from 62% to 73% where the BCO Independent Contractor provides only a tractor and 72% to 77% where the BCO Independent Contractor provides both a tractor and trailing equipment. The BCO Independent Contractor must pay substantially all of the expenses of operating his/her equipment, including driver wages and benefits, fuel, physical damage insurance, maintenance, highway use taxes and debt service, if applicable. The Company passes 100% of fuel surcharges billed to customers for freight hauled by BCO Independent Contractors to its BCO Independent Contractors. During fiscal year 2016, the Company billed customers $129.7 million in fuel surcharges and passed 100% of such fuel surcharges to the BCO Independent Contractors. These fuel surcharges are excluded from revenue and the cost of purchased transportation. 
 The Company maintains internet-based applications for mobile and desktop devices through which BCO Independent Contractors can view a comprehensive listing of the Companys available freight, allowing them to consider rate, size, origin and destination when planning trips. The Landstar Contractors Advantage Purchasing Program (LCAPP) leverages Landstars purchasing power to provide discounts to eligible BCO Independent Contractors when they purchase equipment, fuel, tires and other items. In addition, LCFI provides a source of funds at competitive interest rates to the BCO Independent Contractors to purchase primarily trailing equipment. 
 The number of trucks provided to the Company by BCO Independent Contractors was 9,439 at December 31, 2016, compared to 9,500 at December 26, 2015. At December 31, 2016, 98% of the trucks provided by BCO Independent Contractors were provided by BCO Independent Contractors who provided five or fewer trucks to the Company. The number of trucks provided by BCO Independent Contractors fluctuates daily as a result of truck recruiting and truck terminations. More trucks were recruited in fiscal year 2016 than in fiscal year 2015 but trucks terminated were higher in fiscal year 2016 than in fiscal year 2015, resulting in an overall net decrease of 61 trucks during fiscal year 2016. Landstars BCO Independent Contractor truck turnover was approximately 35% in fiscal year 2016 compared to 25% in fiscal year 2015. Approximately 45% of 2016 turnover was attributable to BCO Independent Contractors who had been with the Company for less than one year. Management believes that factors that have historically favorably impacted turnover include the Companys extensive agent network, the quality of available freight, the Companys programs to reduce the operating costs of its BCO Independent Contractors and Landstars reputation for quality, service, reliability and financial strength. 
 Truck Brokerage Carriers. At December 31, 2016, the Company maintained a database of over 47,000 approved Truck Brokerage Carriers who provide truck capacity to the Company. Truck Brokerage Carriers provide truck capacity to the Company under non-exclusive contractual arrangements and each operates under its own DOT-issued motor carrier operating authority. Truck Brokerage Carriers are paid either a negotiated rate for each load hauled or, to a lesser extent, a contractually agreed-upon fixed rate per load. The Company recruits, approves, establishes contracts with and tracks safety ratings and service records of these third party trucking companies. In addition to providing additional capacity to the Company, the use of Truck Brokerage

 Carriers enables the Company to pursue different types and quality of freight such as temperature-controlled, short-haul traffic and less-than-truckload and, in certain instances, lower-priced freight that generally would not be handled by the Companys BCO Independent Contractors. 
 The Company maintains an internet site through which Truck Brokerage Carriers can view a listing of the Companys freight that is available to them to be hauled. The Landstar Savings Plus Program leverages Landstars purchasing power to provide discounts to eligible Truck Brokerage Carriers when they purchase fuel and equipment and provides the Truck Brokerage Carriers with an electronic payment option. 
 Railroads and Air and Ocean Cargo Carriers. The Company has contracts with Class 1 domestic and Canadian railroads, certain short-line railroads and domestic and international airlines and ocean lines. These relationships allow the Company to pursue the freight best serviced by these forms of transportation capacity. Railroads are paid either a negotiated rate for each load hauled or a contractually agreed-upon fixed rate per load. Air cargo carriers are generally paid a negotiated rate for each load hauled. Ocean cargo carriers are generally paid contractually agreed-upon fixed rates per load. The Company also contracts with other third party capacity providers, such as air charter service providers, when required by specific customer needs. 
Trailing Equipment 
 The Company offers its customers a large and diverse fleet of trailing equipment. The following table illustrates the mix of the trailing equipment as of December 31, 2016, either provided by the BCO Independent Contractors or owned or leased by the Company and made available primarily to BCO Independent Contractors. In general, Truck Brokerage Carriers utilize their own trailing equipment when providing transportation services on behalf of Landstar. Truck Brokerage Carrier trailing equipment is not included in the following table: 

Trailers by Type | 
Van | 12,014
Unsided/platform, including flatbeds, step decks, drop decks and low boys | 3,043 
Temperature-controlled | 113 
Total | 15,170

 Specialized services offered by the Company include those provided by a large fleet of flatbed trailers and multi-axle trailers capable of hauling extremely heavy or oversized loads. Management believes the Company, along with its network of capacity providers, offers the largest fleet of heavy/specialized trailing equipment in the United States. 
 At December 31, 2016, 11,066 of the trailers available to the BCO Independent Contractors were owned by the Company and 239 were leased. In addition, at December 31, 2016, 3,865 trailers were provided by the BCO Independent Contractors. Approximately 32% of Landstars truck transportation revenue was generated on Landstar provided trailing equipment during fiscal year 2016. 
 Customers 
 The Companys customer base is highly diversified and dispersed across many industries, commodities and geographic regions. The Companys top 100 customers accounted for approximately 42% and 44%, respectively, of consolidated revenue during fiscal years 2016 and 2015. Management believes that the Companys overall size, technological applications, geographic coverage, access to equipment and diverse service capability offer the Company significant competitive marketing and operating advantages. These advantages allow the Company to meet the needs of even the largest shippers. Larger shippers often consider reducing the number of authorized carriers they use in favor of a small number of core carriers, such as the Company, whose size and diverse service capabilities enable these core carriers to satisfy most of the shippers transportation needs. The Companys national account customers include the United States Department of Defense and many of the companies included in the Fortune 500. Large shippers are also using third party logistics providers (3PLs) to outsource the management and coordination of their transportation needs. 3PLs and other transportation companies also utilize the Companys available transportation capacity to satisfy their obligations to their shippers. There were eight transportation service providers, including 3PLs, included in the Companys top 25 customers for the fiscal year 2016. Management believes the Companys network of agents and third party capacity providers allows it to efficiently attract and service smaller shippers which may not be as desirable to other large transportation providers (see above under Agent Network). No customer accounted for more than 3% of the Companys 2016 revenue.

Technology 
 Management believes leadership in the development and application of information technology systems is an ongoing part of providing high quality service. Landstar focuses on providing integrated transportation management solutions which emphasize customer service and information coordination among its independent commission sales agents, customers, capacity providers and employees. The Company continues to focus on identifying, purchasing or developing and implementing software applications which are designed to improve its operational and administrative efficiency, assist its independent commission sales agents in efficiently sourcing capacity and pricing transportation services, assist customers in meeting their transportation needs and assist its third party capacity providers in identifying desirable freight. Landstar intends to continue to improve its technologies to meet the total needs of its agents, customers and third party capacity providers. Landstar is currently underway in a multi-year project aimed at increasing efficiencies, primarily through technology, at both Landstar and across all of our agent offices. 
 The Companys information technology systems used in connection with its operations are located in Jacksonville, Florida and, to a lesser extent, in Rockford, Illinois. In addition, the Company utilizes several third party data centers throughout the U.S. Landstar relies, in the regular course of its business, on the proper operation of its information technology systems. 
 Corporate Services 
 The Company provides many administrative support services to its network of independent commission sales agents, third party capacity providers and customers. Management believes that the technological applications purchased or developed and maintained by the Company and its administrative support services provide operational and financial advantages to its independent commission sales agents, third party capacity providers and customers. These, in turn, enhance the operational and financial efficiency of all aspects of the network. 
 Administrative support services that provide operational and financial advantages to the network include customer contract administration, customer credit review and approvals, sales administration and pricing, customer billing, accounts receivable collections, third party capacity settlement, safety and operator and equipment compliance management, insurance claims handling, coordination of vendor discount programs and third party capacity quality programs. Marketing and advertising strategies are also provided by the Company. The Companys practices of accepting customer credit risk and paying its agents and carriers promptly provides a significant competitive advantage to the Company in comparison to less capitalized competitors. 
 Competition 
 Landstar competes primarily in the transportation and logistics services industry with truckload carriers, third party logistics companies, intermodal transportation and logistics service providers, railroads, less-than-truckload carriers and other asset-light transportation and logistics service providers. The transportation and logistics services industry is extremely competitive and fragmented. 
 Management believes that competition for freight transported by the Company is based on service, efficiency and freight rates, which are influenced significantly by the economic environment, particularly the amount of available transportation capacity and freight demand. Management believes that Landstars overall size and availability of a wide range of equipment, together with its geographically dispersed local independent agent network and wide range of service offerings, present the Company with significant competitive advantages over many transportation and logistics service providers. 
 Self-Insured Claims 
 Potential liability associated with accidents in the trucking industry is severe and occurrences are unpredictable. For commercial trucking claims, Landstar retains liability up to $5,000,000 per occurrence. In addition, for commercial trucking claims incurred on or after May 1, 2016 through April 30, 2017, the Company retains liability up to an additional $700,000 in the aggregate on any claims exceeding its $5,000,000 per occurrence self-insured retention. The Company also retains liability of up to $1,000,000 for each general liability claim, up to $250,000 for each workers compensation claim and up to $250,000 for each cargo claim. The Companys exposure to liability associated with accidents incurred by Truck Brokerage Carriers, railroads and air and ocean cargo carriers who transport freight on behalf of the Company is reduced by various factors including the extent to which such carriers maintain their own insurance coverage. A material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents, cargo claims or workers compensation claims or the material unfavorable development of existing claims could have a material adverse effect on Landstars cost of insurance and claims and its results of operations. 
 
8 
 
Regulation 
 Certain of the Operating Subsidiaries are considered motor carriers and/or brokers authorized to arrange for transportation services by motor carriers which are regulated by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (the FMCSA) and by various state agencies. The FMCSA has broad regulatory powers with respect to activities such as motor carrier operations, practices, periodic financial reporting and insurance. Subject to federal and state regulatory authorities or regulation, the Companys capacity providers may transport most types of freight to and from any point in the United States over any route selected. 
 Interstate motor carrier operations are subject to safety requirements prescribed by the FMCSA. Each driver, whether a BCO Independent Contractor or Truck Brokerage Carrier, is required to have a commercial drivers license and may be subject to mandatory drug and alcohol testing. The FMCSAs commercial drivers license and drug and alcohol testing requirements have not adversely affected the Companys ability to source the capacity necessary to meet its customers transportation needs. 
 In addition, certain of the Operating Subsidiaries are licensed as Ocean Transportation Intermediaries by the U.S. Federal Maritime Commission as non-vessel-operating common carriers and/or as ocean freight forwarders. The Companys air transportation activities in the United States are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation as an indirect air carrier. One of the Operating Subsidiaries is licensed by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security through the Bureau of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (U.S. Customs) as a customs broker. The Company is also subject to regulations and requirements relating to safety and security promulgated by, among others, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security through U.S. Customs and the Transportation Security Administration, the Canada Border Services Agency and various state and local agencies and port authorities. 
 The transportation industry is subject to other potential regulatory and legislative changes (such as the possibility of more stringent environmental, climate change and/or safety/security regulations, limits on vehicle weight and size and a mandate to implement electronic logging devices) that may affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices or by changing the demand for motor carrier services or the cost of providing truckload or other transportation or logistics services. 
 In addition, because the U.S. government is one of the Companys customers, the Company must comply with and is affected by laws and regulations relating to doing business with the federal government. 
 Seasonality 
 Landstars operations are subject to seasonal trends common to the trucking industry. Results of operations for the quarter ending in March are typically lower than for the quarters ending in June, September and December. 
Employees 
 As of December 31, 2016, the Company and its subsidiaries employed 1,197 individuals. Approximately five Landstar Ranger drivers (out of a Company total of approximately 9,439 drivers for BCO Independent Contractors) are members of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. The Company considers relations with its employees to be good.
