ITEM 1. BUSINESS HISTORY AND OVERVIEW
 
CURE Pharmaceutical Holding Corp. (the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on May 15, 2014. The Company was formerly named Makkanotti Group Corp. and was formed to engage in the business of manufacturing food paper bags in Nicosia, Cyprus.
 
On November 7, 2016, the board of directors and the majority stockholder of the then outstanding shares of registrant’s common stock executed a written consent to change registrant’s name from Makkanotti Group Corp. to CURE Pharmaceutical Holdings Corp. The Certificate of Amendment to Articles of Incorporation was filed with the State of Nevada on November 30, 2016. 
 
Further, on November 7, 2016, the registrant, in a reverse take-over transaction, acquired a specialty pharmaceutical and bioscience company based in California that specializes in drug delivery technologies, by executing a Share Exchange Agreement and Conversion Agreement (“Exchange Agreement”) by and among the registrant and a holder of a majority of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the registrant prior to the closing (the “Majority Stockholder”), on the one hand, and Cure Pharmaceutical Corporation, a California corporation (“Cure Pharmaceutical”), all of the shareholders of Cure Pharmaceutical’s issued and outstanding share capital (the “Cure Pharm Shareholders”) and the holders of certain convertible promissory notes of Cure Pharmaceutical (“Cure Pharm Noteholders”), on the other hand. Hereinafter, this share exchange transaction is described as the “Share Exchange.”
 
The following is a brief description of the terms and conditions of the Exchange Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereunder that are material to the registrant: 
 

· | Share Exchange and Share Cancellations. The registrant shall issue 9,010,000 restricted shares of its common stock, $0.001 par value per share (“Common Stock”), to the Cure Pharm Shareholders in the aggregate, in exchange for 2,718,253 shares of Cure Pharmaceutical's common stock held by them, representing 100% of the then issued and outstanding common stock of Cure Pharmaceutical (the “Share Exchange”). In connection with the Share Exchange, the Majority Stockholder agreed to cancel 16,181,400 shares of Common Stock of the registrant in exchange for a warrant (the “Majority Stockholder Warrant”) to purchase up to 1,640,305 shares of Common Stock of the registrant at an exercise price of $2.00 per share and with an exercise period of four years commencing on the date of issuance of the warrant. In addition, one other shareholder of the registrant entered into a share cancellation agreement with the registrant whereby such shareholder agreed to cancel 652,390 shares of the registrant's common stock at the closing of the Share Exchange in order to induce Cure Pharmaceutical to enter into the Exchange Agreement.

As a result of the Share Exchange, Cure Pharmaceutical became a wholly owned subsidiary of the registrant, and the Cure Pharm Shareholders and Cure Pharm Noteholders became the controlling shareholders of the registrant. 
 
The closing of the transactions contemplated under the Exchange Agreement (the “Closing”) took place on November 7, 2016 (the “Closing Date”). As a result, the registrant had a total of 23,266,733 shares of common stock issued and outstanding at the Closing Date, with the Cure Pharm Shareholders and Noteholders collectively owning approximately 64.97% of the registrant’s issued and outstanding Common Stock.
 
CURE Pharmaceutical Corporation
 
Our wholly owned subsidiary and operating business, Cure Pharmaceutical, located in Oxnard, California was originally incorporated in July 2011 as a developer of advanced oral thin film (“OTF”) for the delivery of nutraceutical, Over-The-Counter (“OTC”) and prescription products for human and veterinary markets. We utilize drug delivery technologies to develop and commercialize new applications of proven therapeutics through our CureFilm™ technology, as well as through sublingual and transdermal applications. Our exclusive micro encapsulation of drug actives allows for a higher volume of an active and if required, multiple actives to be produced on a single OTF strip. We expect this technology will allow us to produce a broad spectrum of pharmaceutical, OTC and nutraceutical products.
 
We are currently focused on partnering with pharmaceutical and biotech companies seeking to deliver drug actives utilizing and benefitting from our proprietary CureFilm™, sublingual and transdermal applications and when preferable to take our own products from clinical process to commercialization. We manufacture our products in our Current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) registered manufacturing facility.
 
According to IBIS World’s Global Pharmaceuticals & Medicine Manufacturing Market Research Report (2013), the worldwide pharmaceutical market alone represents $1 trillion in revenue and has had an average annual growth of 3.7% from 2008 to 2013. This growth has resulted from the rising demand for healthcare and medications worldwide, especially from emerging economies. Higher healthcare standards and greater emphasis on illness prevention have given pharmaceuticals a higher significance among consumers, driving sales and overall industry growth, which is expected to continue.
 
The pet industry is also forecasted to grow exponentially. As domestic pets increasingly become members of the family, pet owners are spending more and more on pet care, resulting in continued future growth. According to the American Pet Products Association (“APPA”), the pet industry is forecasted to reach $62.5 billion by 2016. The most lucrative segment of the pet care industry is pet health care, with health and wellness solutions gaining pace across the industry and with significant opportunities for manufacturers allocating larger research and development budgets, and implementing product innovation and marketing to exploit them. The APPA estimated that $14.98 billion is spent in the OTC pet medicine markets in the United States alone. We intend to utilize our CureFilm™ Technology to develop products marketed towards the veterinarian market.
 
Though in its infancy stage (10 years old), OTF Technology is experiencing a major surge in acceptance and adoption by pharmaceutical and biotech companies as they search for new and better ways to deliver drug actives. We believe there are only a handful of pharmaceutical and biotech companies capable of producing OTF strips, limiting competition. In addition, we believe that our proprietary and patented technology creates opportunities within the targeted marketplaces far surpassing the capability of these companies to compete.
 
CureFilm™ Technology and Value Proposition
 
Typical forms of drug delivery that consumers have been familiar with over the years, include tablets, capsules, chewable, gummies, and more recent developments, such as melts and sublingual drops and sprays. We believe that we are one of the companies at the forefront of OTF drug delivery technology. Our OTF product is about the size of a postage stamp using a matrix that maximizes the amount of “active” drug that can be delivered via OTF.
 
Our CureFilm™ Technology consists of patented, patent pending and trade secrets in two areas: OTF – Core Technology, Sublingual Technology and Transdermal (skin) Technology.

Our proprietary multi-layer CureFilm™ allows dosages of many pharmaceutical, OTC and nutraceutical products to be put onto a small strip applied to the cheek (buccal), under the tongue (sublingual). We believe that what sets us apart from the competition is our proprietary patented CureFilm™ Technology, multi-layer systems and formulation technologies that:
 

· | Consists of two components - a liquid-based film layer that contains and stabilizes the active ingredients, and a powder matrix layer.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Provides improved stability as well as delivery of active ingredients. 
· | Contains functional qualities to include extra flavoring ingredients, pliability enhancers, and mucosal permeation enhancers. 

 
In a two layer strip, the layers are designed to work together, in combination with the powder composition. The powder composition can be varied, as can the muco-adhesion properties of the strips, to alter the dissolution and absorption rates of the medicament. A complete multilayer system allows for increased stability, higher loading of active ingredients, and increased taste and palatability.
 
Another recent advancement in our CureFilm™ Technology utilizes micro-encapsulation of selected active ingredients. In the micro-encapsulation process, microscopic particles or droplets envelop the active ingredients to protect and shield them. The technique used in the micro-encapsulation process depends on various factors including the physical and chemical properties of the active ingredients. This micro-encapsulation technology has allowed the delivery of higher dosing with better flavor masking.
 
We believe that our CureFilm™ Technology has the following competitive advantages over other drug delivery technologies:
 

· | With our proprietary formulations we can put more drugs per cm2 on a single strip than any of our competitors while still maintaining a positive patient experience.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Ability to put multiple actives on one OTF. 
· | More stable, durable and quicker to dissolve than other oral deliveries. 
· | Improves the onset of action, lower dosing and enhance the efficacy thereby widening the therapeutic index. 
· | Differentiation within large therapeutic categories and potentially improves patient compliance. 
· | Ability to deliver actives on a single strip through both buccal and gastrointestinal tract, thereby allowing for sustained release. 
· | Enters the blood stream directly making it fast acting and more effective. 
· | Easy to use, transport and no liquid needed to administer. 
· | Ideal for children, elderly patients and patients who have trouble swallowing. 
· | Palatable in terms of taste.

Clinical Development
 
We partner with pharmaceutical companies looking for new methods to deliver drug actives. Under Section (505)(b)(2) of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, ("(505)(b)(2)") the FDA may grant market exclusivity for a term of up to three years of exclusivity following approval of a listed drug that contains previously approved active ingredients but is approved in a new dosage, dosage form, route of administration or combination. The 505(b)(2) pathway is also the regulatory approach to be followed if an applicant intends to file an application for a product containing a drug that is already approved by the FDA for a certain indication and for which the applicant is seeking approval for a new indication or for a new use, the approval of which is required to be supported by new clinical trials, other than bioavailability studies. We have implemented a strategy under which we actively look for such so-called “repurposing opportunities” and determine whether our proprietary CureFilm™ Technology adds value to the product.
 
We currently have five such drug repurposing projects in our development pipeline, although there can be no assurance that such projects will be fully developed. The companies we partner with are typically responsible for managing the regulatory approval process of the product with the FDA and/or other regulatory bodies, as well as for the marketing and distribution of the products. On a case-by-case basis, we may be responsible for providing all or part of the documentation required for the regulatory submission.
 
In addition to pursuing partnering arrangements that provide for the full funding of a drug development project, we may undertake development of selected product opportunities until the marketing and distribution stage. We would first assess the potential and associated costs for successful development of a product, and then determine at which stage it would be most prudent to seek a partner, balancing costs against the potential for higher returns later in the development process. We currently have five of such potential drug candidates in our product pipeline, all of which are in the formulation development and pre-clinical phase of development. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to fully develop, market and distribute OTF products for these drug candidates.
 
Competition
 
We face competition from other companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations for collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, in recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientific and management personnel and for licenses to additional technologies. Many of our competitors, including Monosol, BioDelivery Sciences International, IntelGenx and LTS Lohmann, will have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we have. Our success will be based in part on our ability to build, obtain regulatory approval for and market acceptance of, and actively manage a portfolio of drugs that addresses unmet medical needs and creates value in patient therapy.
 
The OTF manufacturing industry is relatively new, having only emerged over the last ten years. Although currently there are just a handful of current players within this industry, we expect that we will be subject to competition from numerous other companies that currently operate or are planning to enter the markets in which we compete. To date, among manufacturers of OTF, some medications that either are or have been available by OTF manufacturers in the marketplace include:
 

· | Zuplenz (the first oral soluble film approved by the FDA as a prescription medication) 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Benadryl (diphenhydramine product and anti-histamine used for allergies and mild sedative) 
· | Gas-X (simethicone product for bloating, gas, and gastrointestinal complaint) 
· | Melatonin PM (hormonal product sold as a "dietary supplement" marketed for insomnia) 
· | Orajel Kids (benzocaine product for dental pain) 
· | Suboxone (buprenorphine and naloxone fixed dosage combination product for opioid addiction)
· | Subutex (buprenorphine product for opioid addiction) 
· | Sudafed (phenylephrine or pseudoephedrine product for nasal congestion) 
· | TheraFlu (combination product of pain reliever, anti-pyretic and decongestant) 
· | Triaminic (children's anti-tussive product) 

 
The barriers to enter this market are the “know how’s” of developing and formulating consumer desired products which taste great. Also, the high cost of entry by companies who have no expertise in the market makes entry by competitors risky since the technology to develop product is expensive and proprietary. The key factors affecting the development and commercialization of our drug delivery products are likely to include, among other factors:
 

· | The safety and efficacy of our products; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | The relative speed with which we can develop products; 
· | Generic competition for any product that we develop; 
· | Our ability to defend our existing intellectual property and to broaden our intellectual property and technology base;
· | Our ability to differentiate our products; 
· | Our ability to develop products that can be manufactured on a cost effective basis; 
· | Our ability to manufacture our products in compliance with cGMP and any other regulatory requirements; and 
· | Our ability to obtain financing. 

 
In order to establish ourselves as a viable industry partner, we plan to continue to invest in our research and development activities and in our manufacturing technology expertise, in order to further strengthen our technology base and to develop the ability to manufacture our CureFilm™ products ourselves, at competitive costs. Our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business.
