ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
Founded in 1992, Anika Therapeutics, Inc. is a global joint preservation company that creates and delivers meaningful advancements in early intervention orthopedic care. Based on our collaborations with clinicians to understand what they need most to treat their patients, we develop minimally invasive products that restore active living for people around the world. We are committed to leading in high opportunity spaces within orthopedics, including osteoarthritis (“OA”) pain management, regenerative solutions, soft tissue repair and bone preserving joint technologies.
 
We have nearly thirty years of global expertise developing, manufacturing and commercializing products based on our hyaluronic acid, or HA, technology platform. HA is a naturally occurring polymer found throughout the body that is vital for proper joint health and tissue function. Our proprietary technologies for modifying the HA molecule allow product properties to be tailored specifically to multiple uses, including enabling longer residence time to support OA pain management and creating a solid form of HA called HYAFF, which is the platform for our regenerative solutions portfolio.
 
In early 2020, we expanded our overall technology platform and significantly enhanced our commercial infrastructure, especially in the United States, through our strategic acquisitions of Parcus Medical, LLC, or Parcus Medical, a sports medicine implant and instrumentation solutions provider focused on sports medicine and soft tissue repair, and Arthrosurface, Inc., or Arthrosurface, a company specializing in less invasive, bone preserving partial and total joint replacement solutions. Through these acquisitions, we have transformed our company. We expanded our addressable market from the over $1 billion global OA pain management market to the over $8 billion joint preservation market (which includes the faster growing sports medicine and extremities segments), improved our commercial capabilities, and expanded our product pipeline and research and development expertise in our target markets.
 
As we look towards the future, our business is positioned to capture value within our target market of joint preservation. We believe our success will be driven by our:

Other
 
Our Other product family consists of legacy HA-based products that do not fit into one of our other primary product categories. These products include, Hyalobarrier, an anti-adhesion barrier indicated for use after abdomino-pelvic surgeries, and Hyalomatrix, which is used for the treatment of complex wounds such as burns and ulcers, products used in connection with the treatment of ears, nose and throat disorders, and ophthalmic products, including injectable, high molecular weight HA products used as viscoelastic agents in ophthalmic surgical procedures such as cataract extraction and intraocular lens implantation.
Sales Channels
 
A substantial majority of our products are used by clinicians and surgeons in one of two environments: office-based procedures usually focused on injections, or surgical settings, including hospital operating rooms and ambulatory surgery centers, or ASCs. These settings typically require different commercial approaches and have distinct call points, which requires diversity in our sales approach. For instance, our Joint Pain Management family and certain products in our Other category are almost entirely utilized in an office-based setting while our Joint Preservation and Restoration products are almost exclusively consumed in hospital operating rooms or ASCs.
 
As a result of these distinctions, we employ multiple sales models in the United States to ensure that we are meeting the needs of our customers and other healthcare system stakeholders. For many years, we have maintained a mutually beneficial commercial partnership with Mitek, which sells Orthovisc and Monovisc throughout the United States. We also have other U.S. commercial partnerships for certain other products in our Joint Pain Management and Other product families. Under these commercial partnerships, we sell our products directly to our partners, which perform the vast majority of the downstream sales and marketing activities to customers and end-users. In addition to a transfer price, we may also structure our arrangements to receive a royalty on end user sales.
 
Since 2019, and with our expanded commercial infrastructure as a result of the Parcus Medical and Arthrosurface acquisitions, we have sold our Joint Preservation and Restoration family directly to customers, including hospitals and ASCs, through our direct sales representatives and large network of independent third party distributors. Within this framework, we employ selling models that seek to maximize the benefit for our company and our customers, including contracts with group purchasing organizations and certain fixed-price delivery models. During 2020, we completed the integration of our U.S. commercial organization including effecting cross training to sell the consolidated Joint Preservation and Restoration product portfolio.
 
For business outside of the United States, we market and sell our products using a worldwide network of commercial partners to provide a solid foundation for revenue growth and territorial expansion. Our relationships with these partners are generally structured such that we sell our products to these partners directly while they, with global support from our team, perform the in-country sales and marketing activities to drive growth and adoption locally. We expect to generally maintain this model for the foreseeable future, while also selectively evaluating other options and being opportunistic about adopting other models, including direct sales, in certain jurisdictions.
 
We believe that our overall sales approach provides our business with a strong base to drive revenue growth as we continue to grow and scale our commercial infrastructure while retaining the flexibility in certain circumstances to enter into strategic arrangements to take advantage of the benefits certain other organizations have established for themselves. We will continue to focus on expanding our own commercial capabilities, including with respect to market access, innovative sales and delivery models, and improved logistics management.
 
Manufacturing
 
We manufacture all of our HA-based products, including all of our Joint Pain Management products and certain additional products, at our facility in Bedford, Massachusetts, where we have developed significant know-how around procedures such as homogenized mixing and filling of highly-viscous liquids and manipulation of solid HA into scaffolds or other presentations. We have a substantial manufacturing presence at our facility in Sarasota, Florida, and we engage third-party organizations as contract manufacturers for a number of our products including our bone preserving joint technologies.
 
    7 

  

The raw materials necessary to manufacture our products are generally available from multiple sources. However, we rely on a small number of suppliers for certain key raw materials and a small number of suppliers for certain other materials required for the manufacturing and delivery of these products.
 
Research and Development 
 
Our research and development efforts primarily consist of the development of new medical applications for our technology platforms, the development of intellectual property with respect to our technology platforms, the management of clinical trials for certain product candidates, the preparation and processing of applications for regulatory clearances and approvals, and process development and scale-up manufacturing activities for our existing and new product development initiatives. For 2020, 2019, and 2018, research and development expenses were $23.4 million, $16.7 million and $18.2 million respectively. The increase in 2020 was primarily due to preparation activities and initial execution related to the clinical studies in the United States for Cingal and Hyalofast, certain European post-market clinical studies, and activities associated with new product development in our research and development pipeline, including the acquisitions of Arthrosurface and Parcus Medical in early 2020. We anticipate that we will continue to commit significant resources to research and development activities, including in relation to new product development, pre-clinical activities and clinical trials.
 
Our new product development efforts focus on products in four large and growing orthopedic markets to drive long-term growth: OA pain management, regenerative solutions, soft tissue repair and bone preserving joint technologies. In order to better inform and target our research and development investment, we routinely interact with key external stakeholders to leverage customer and patient insights in our development process that help ensure we bring needed solutions to the market. In the near term, our general new product development will be focused on enhancements to existing products, new soft tissue fixation and extremities products like our WristMotion product that recently achieved 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and clinical development to enable us to commercialize in the U.S. market our Cingal and Hyalofast products, which are currently sold only outside the United States. As we move forward, we plan to continue to invest in novel and meaningful products for our target markets based on our core capabilities, including our regenerative HA technology platform and manufacturing expertise.
 
Our development focus for OA pain management will continue to be on bringing Cingal, our third-generation, single-injection viscosupplement product, to the U.S. market. While we have conducted previous clinical trials for Cingal, including a trial that supported CE Mark approval for Cingal, the FDA has indicated an additional Phase III trial is necessary to support U.S. approval. In 2020, we initiated a pilot study to confirm our trial design to increase our probability of success in a Phase III trial and generate data that ultimately will be needed to support FDA approval. Several trial sites were activated during 2020, and the first patient was enrolled in the pilot study in September 2020. However, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to face uncertainty related to the ultimate timing of this Cingal pilot study due to COVID-19-related enrollment challenges. Given the evolving environment, we will continue to update clinical trial timelines as we have more visibility with respect to the length and regional impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. For additional information on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our Cingal pilot study, please refer to the section captioned “Item 1A. Risk Factors. Risks related to the COVID-19 Pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic could adversely impact our development activities, preclinical studies and clinical trials, which could significantly impair our long-term business plans and operating results.”
 
Development for our Joint Preservation and Restoration family is focused in several areas. We continue to progress the ongoing clinical trial to support approval in the United States for Hyalofast, our single step cartilage repair therapy, currently sold only outside the United States. We are actively pursuing multiple solutions to accelerate patient enrollment, including initiating sites in Mexico, Indonesia, and the Philippines which has been delayed due to COVID-19. We are also focused on the development of additional solutions and line extensions for our soft tissue repair and bone preserving joint technologies business, largely within the faster-growing extremities segments. These include continued progress on a therapy targeted at rotator cuff repair utilizing our proprietary solid HA technology, as well as other programs that leverage our HA expertise to augment or improve our current offerings.

Intellectual Property
 
We seek patent and trademark protection for our key technologies, products and product improvements, both in the U.S. and in select foreign countries. When determined appropriate, we enforce and plan to enforce and defend our patent and trademark rights. While we rely on our patent and trademark portfolio to provide us with competitive advantages as it relates to our existing and future product lines, it is not our sole source of protection. We also rely upon trade secrets and continuing technological innovations to develop and maintain our competitive position.
Governmental Regulation
 
The clinical development, manufacturing, and marketing of our products are subject to governmental regulation in the United States, the European Union, and other territories worldwide. Various statutes, regulations and interpretations thereof, directives, and guidelines, including the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act in the United States, govern the development, design, non-clinical and clinical research, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, premarket clearance or approval, adverse event reporting, advertising, and promotion of our products. Product development and approval within these various regulatory frameworks can take a number of years and generally involves the expenditure of substantial resources. Pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers are also inspected regularly by the FDA and other applicable regulatory bodies.
 
Medical products regulated by the FDA are generally classified as drugs, biologics, or medical devices, and the current classification standards for our current or future products may be altered over time. Drugs and biologic products undergo rigorous preclinical testing prior to beginning clinical trials. Clinical trials for new drugs or biologic products include Phase I trials in healthy volunteers to understand safety, dosage tolerance, and pharmacokinetics, Phase II trials in a limited patient population to identify initial efficacy and side effects, and Phase III pivotal trials to statistically evaluate the safety and efficacy of the product. Medical devices intended for human use are classified into three categories (Class I, II or III) on the basis of the controls deemed reasonably necessary by the FDA to assure their safety and effectiveness. Class II devices are cleared for marketing under the pre-market notification 510(k) regulatory pathway, which may include clinical testing. Class III devices require pre-market approval based on valid scientific evidence of safety and effectiveness, including evidence elicited through appropriate clinical testing. The failure to adequately demonstrate the quality, safety, and efficacy of a product under development can delay or prevent regulatory approval of the product. In order to gain marketing approval, we must submit to the relevant regulatory authority for review information on the quality aspects of the product as well as the non-clinical and clinical data. The FDA undertakes this review in the United States.
 
In the European Union, medical devices must be CE Marked in order to be marketed. CE marking a device involves working with a Notified Body, and in some cases a Competent Authority, to demonstrate that the device meets all applicable requirements of the Medical Devices Directive and that the Quality Management System is compliant. Europe’s Medical Device Directive, or MDD, is being replaced by the European Medical Device Regulation, or MDR, enacted in 2017, and due for implementation in May 2021. MDR requirements will phase in on a product-by-product basis as certifications under MDD lapse and will require all products to undergo review and approval under these new regulations, which will generally require increased levels of clinical support as compared to MDD requirements. Drug approval in the European Union follows one of several possible processes: (i) a centralized procedure involving members of the European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use; (ii) a “mutual recognition procedure” in which an individual country's regulatory agency approves the product followed by “mutual recognition” of this approval by regulatory agencies of other countries; or (iii) a decentralized procedure in which the approval is sought through the regulatory agencies of multiple countries at the same time.
 
Approval timelines can range from several months to several years, or applications can be denied entirely. Product or product component classifications as drugs, biologics, or medical devices may change over time due to new regulations or augmented interpretation of data or current regulations. The approval process can be affected by a number of factors. For example, additional studies or clinical trials may be requested during the review, which may delay marketing approval and involve unbudgeted costs. As a condition of approval, the regulatory agency may require post-marketing surveillance to monitor for adverse effects, and may require other additional studies, as it deems appropriate. After approval for an initial indication, further clinical studies are generally necessary to gain approval for any additional indications. The terms of any approval, including labeling content, may be more restrictive than expected and could affect the marketability of a product.

The FDA has broad regulatory compliance and enforcement powers. If the FDA determines that we failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can take a variety of compliance or enforcement actions, including, without limitation, issuing an FDA Form 483 notice of inspectional observations or a warning letter, imposing civil money penalties, suspending or delaying issuance of approvals, requiring product recall, imposing a total or partial shutdown of production, withdrawal of approvals or clearances already granted, pursuing product seizures, consent decrees or other injunctive relief, or criminal prosecution through the Department of Justice. The FDA can also require us to repair, replace, or refund the cost of products that we manufactured or distributed. Outside the United States, regulatory agencies may exert a range of similar powers.
 
We are subject to various U.S. federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback, false claims, and transparency reporting laws. Similar review and regulation of advertising and marketing practices exists in the other geographic areas where we operate.
 
We are also subject to various laws and regulations concerning data privacy in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere, including the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) in the European Union. These regulations impose several requirements on the processing, administration, security, and confidentiality of personal data and empower enforcement agencies to impose large penalties for noncompliance.
 
Environmental Laws
 
We believe that we are in compliance with all foreign, federal, state, and local environmental regulations with respect to our manufacturing facilities. The cost of ongoing compliance with such regulations does not have a material effect on our operations. 
Competition
 
We compete with many companies including large pharmaceutical firms and large and specialized medical device companies across our product lines. For our Joint Pain Management products, our principal competitors include Sanofi Genzyme, Zimmer Biomet, Inc., Bioventus Inc., and Ferring Pharmaceuticals, as well as other companies that are commercializing or developing competitive products. Our key competitors for our Joint Preservation and Restoration products include Arthrex, Inc., the DePuy Synthes Companies of Johnson & Johnson, Smith & Nephew PLC., Stryker Corporation, and Zimmer Biomet, Inc., as well as certain smaller organizations that focus on subsets of the larger industry. Many of these companies have substantially greater financial resources, larger research and development staffs, more extensive marketing and manufacturing organizations, and more experience in the regulatory processes than we have. We also compete with academic institutions, government agencies, and other research organizations that may be involved in the research and development and commercialization of products. Many of our competitors also compete against us in securing relationships with collaborators for their research and development and commercialization programs.
 
We compete with other market participants primarily on the efficacy of our products, our products’ reputation for safety, and the breadth of our overall product portfolio. Other factors that impact competition in our industry are the timing and scope of regulatory approvals, the availability of raw material and finished product supply, marketing and sales capability, reimbursement coverage, product pricing, and patent protection. Some of the principal factors that may affect our ability to compete in our target markets include:
 

● | The quality and breadth of our continued development of our product portfolio;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our ability to complete successful clinical studies and obtain FDA marketing and foreign regulatory approvals prior to our competitors;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
    10 

  


● | Our ability to continue to build our commercial infrastructure, integrate our sales channels and execute our sales strategies; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The execution by our key partners of their commercial strategies for our products and our ability to manage our relationships with those key partners;


● | Our ability to recruit and retain skilled employees; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------


● | The availability of capital resources to fund strategic activities related to the significant expansion of our business or product portfolio, including through acquisitions of third parties or certain assets.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 We are aware of a number of companies that are developing and/or marketing competitive products. In some cases, competitors have already obtained product approvals, submitted applications for approval, or commenced human clinical studies, either in the United States or in certain foreign countries. All products face substantial competition. There is a risk that we will be unable to compete effectively against our current or future competitors. Additionally, legislation and regulation aimed at curbing rising healthcare costs has resulted in a consolidation trend in the healthcare industry to create larger companies, including hospitals, with greater market power. In turn, this has led to greater and more intense competition in the provision of products and services to market participants. Important market makers, like group purchasing organizations and integrated delivery networks, have increased their negotiating leverage, and if these market makers demand significant price concessions or if we are excluded as a supplier by these market makers, our product revenue could be adversely impacted.
 
Seasonality
 
Our business is generally not seasonal in nature due to the nature of our product mix and sales channels and strategies.
 
Human Capital Management
 
We believe that creating a diverse, talented, and inclusive workplace is a central aspect to our culture, employee engagement, innovation, operational excellence and overall performance. In turn, this culture and drive for performance is an important factor in our ability to attract and retain qualified employees and key talent. Our culture is centered around our fundamental values of:

● | People: we engage and invest in each other in a community that values diversity and inclusion.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Innovation: we are agile and entrepreneurial in developing and delivering meaningful solutions to our healthcare stakeholders within our target markets.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Quality: we strive for the highest quality and compliance in everything we do.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Teamwork: we operate with mutual respect and trust and are collaborative as we grow together.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Integrity: we live up to our promises and do the right thing, every day.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Accountability: we are empowered and accountable to deliver results and value to all of our stakeholders.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our industry requires complex processes for product development and commercialization, each of which requires deep expertise and experience across a broad array of disciplines. Medical device companies therefore compete for a limited number of qualified applicants to fill specialized positions, which requires competitive compensation and benefits packages and an attractive culture, among other things.
 
As of December 31, 2020, we employed 277 fulltime employees at four physical facilities primarily located in Bedford, Massachusetts; Franklin, Massachusetts; Sarasota, Florida; and Padova, Italy. The Franklin and Sarasota sites were added in 2020 as a result of acquisitions of Arthrosurface and Parcus Medical, respectively. We grew our employee base by 145 people in 2020, 75 of which were a direct result of the companies we acquired. Twenty-five of our employees are located outside the United States.
 
    11 

  

We expect to continue to add employees in 2021 and beyond as we grow our business. To attract and retain qualified employees and key talent, we offer total rewards packages to every employee consisting of base salary, a potential cash bonus based on individual and company performance, and a comprehensive benefit package, as well as equity compensation for certain employees based on various criteria including their level within the company. Bonus opportunity and equity compensation increase as a percentage of total compensation based on level of responsibility. A large number of our employees have obtained advanced degrees in their professions. We support our employees’ further development with individualized development plans, mentoring, coaching, group training, conference attendance and financial support, including tuition reimbursement.
 
We believe that employees understanding how their work contributes to our overall strategy and performance is key to our success. In order to communicate with respect to these important topics in manners that are engaging to our team, we utilize a variety of channels, including all employee town hall meetings with senior management, regular email updates from our chief executive officer and other key members of the executive team, and employee engagement surveys.
 
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have augmented certain of our normal business practices to ensure that we promote health and safety for our employees. We have established safety policies and protocols, and we regularly update our employees with respect to any changes. We transitioned much of our administrative workforce to work remotely in order to prioritize the health of those who must be onsite to perform their jobs, including our manufacturing staff, and we have adjusted attendance policies to encourage those who may be ill to stay home. We have provided an abundance of personal protective equipment and cleaning supplies. We require masks to be worn in our facilities and have prohibited all non-essential domestic and international travel for all employees. We have also provided general information updates and support for our employees to ensure that they have resources and information to protect their health and that of those around them, including their families and co-workers.
 
Product Liability
 
The testing, marketing, and sale of human health care products entail an inherent risk of allegations of product liability, and we cannot assure that substantial product liability claims will not be asserted against us. Although we have not received any material product liability claims to date, we cannot assure that if material claims arise in the future, our insurance will be adequate to cover all situations. Moreover, we cannot assure that such insurance, or additional insurance, if required, will be available in the future or, if available, will be available on commercially reasonable terms. Any product liability claim, if successful, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
