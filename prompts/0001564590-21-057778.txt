Item 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

 Unless the context otherwise requires, “we”, “us”, “our”, “WestRock” and “the Company” refer to the business of WestRock Company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and its partially-owned consolidated subsidiaries for periods on or after November 2, 2018 and to WRKCo Inc. (formerly known as WestRock Company, “WRKCo”) for periods prior to November 2, 2018.
 General 

 WestRock is a multinational provider of sustainable fiber-based paper and packaging solutions. We partner with our customers to provide differentiated, sustainable paper and packaging solutions that help them win in the marketplace. Our team members support customers around the world from our operating and business locations in North America, South America, Europe, Asia and Australia. 
 On November 2, 2018, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), dated as of January 28, 2018, among WRKCo, KapStone Paper and Packaging Corporation (“KapStone”), WestRock Company (formerly known as Whiskey Holdco, Inc.), Whiskey Merger Sub, Inc. and Kola Merger Sub, Inc., the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of KapStone through a transaction in which: (i) Whiskey Merger Sub, Inc. merged with and into WRKCo, with WRKCo surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and (ii) Kola Merger Sub, Inc. merged with and into KapStone, with KapStone surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (together, the “KapStone Acquisition”). As a result, among other things, the Company became the ultimate parent of WRKCo, KapStone and their respective subsidiaries, and the Company changed its name to “WestRock Company” and WRKCo changed its name to “WRKCo Inc.”. WRKCo (formerly known as WestRock Company) was the accounting acquirer in the transaction; therefore, the historical consolidated financial statements of WRKCo for periods prior to the KapStone Acquisition are also considered to be the historical financial statements of the Company. The Company is the successor issuer to both WRKCo and KapStone pursuant to Rule 12g-3(c) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). See “Note 3. Acquisitions and Investments” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.
 
We report our financial results of operations in the following two reportable segments: Corrugated Packaging, which consists of our containerboard mills, corrugated packaging and distribution operations, as well as our merchandising displays and recycling procurement operations; and Consumer Packaging, which consists of our consumer mills, food and beverage and partition operations. Prior to the completion of our monetization program in fiscal 2020, we had a third reportable segment, Land and Development, which previously sold real estate, primarily in the Charleston, SC region. Following completion of the monetization of these assets, we ceased reporting the results of the Land and Development segment as a separate segment. 
 Products
 Corrugated Packaging Segment
 We are one of the largest integrated producers of linerboard and corrugating medium (“containerboard”), corrugated products and specialty papers (including kraft papers and saturating kraft) in North America measured by tons produced, one of the largest producers of high-graphics preprinted linerboard measured by net sales in North America and one of the largest manufacturers of temporary promotional point-of-purchase displays in North America measured by net sales. We have integrated corrugated operations in North America, Brazil and India. We believe we are one of the largest paper recyclers in North America and our recycling operations provide substantially all of the recycled fiber that we consume to our containerboard and paperboard mills, as well as to third parties. Our Brazil operations own and operate forestlands that provide virgin fiber to our mill in Brazil.
 We operate an integrated corrugated packaging system that manufactures primarily containerboard, corrugated sheets, corrugated packaging and preprinted linerboard for sale to consumer and industrial products manufacturers and corrugated box manufacturers. We produce a full range of high-quality corrugated containers designed to protect, ship, store, promote and display products made to our customers’ merchandising and distribution specifications. We convert corrugated sheets into corrugated products ranging from one-color 
 3


protective cartons to graphically brilliant point-of-purchase packaging. Our corrugated container plants serve local customers and regional and large national accounts. Corrugated packaging is used to provide protective packaging for shipment and distribution of food, paper, health and beauty, and other household, consumer, commercial and industrial products. Corrugated packaging may also be graphically enhanced for retail sale, particularly in club store locations. We provide customers with innovative packaging solutions to help them promote and sell their products. We provide structural and graphic design, engineering services and custom, proprietary and standard automated packaging machines, offering customers turn-key installation, automation, line integration and packaging solutions. We offer a machinery solution that creates pouches that replace single-use plastics, including bubble mailers. We also distribute corrugated packaging materials and other specialty packaging products, including stretch film, void fill, carton sealing tape and other specialty tapes, through our network of warehouses and distribution facilities. To make corrugated sheet stock, we feed linerboard and corrugating medium into a corrugator that flutes the medium to specified sizes, glues the linerboard and fluted medium together, and slits and cuts the resulting corrugated paperboard into sheets to customer specifications. Our containerboard mills and corrugated container operations are integrated with the majority of our containerboard production used internally by our corrugated container operations. The balance is either used in trade swaps with other manufacturers or sold domestically and internationally.
 We design, manufacture and, in certain cases, pack temporary displays for sale to consumer products companies and retailers. These displays are used as marketing tools to support new product introductions and specific product promotions in mass merchandising stores, supermarkets, convenience stores, home improvement stores and other retail locations. We also design, manufacture and, in some cases, pre-assemble permanent displays for these customers. We make temporary displays primarily from corrugated paperboard. Unlike temporary displays, permanent displays are restocked with our customers’ product; therefore, they are constructed primarily from metal, plastic, wood and other durable materials. We provide contract packing services, such as multi-product promotional packing and product manipulation, such as multipacks and onpacks. We manufacture and distribute point of sale material utilizing litho, screen and digital printing technologies. We manufacture lithographic laminated packaging for sale to our customers that require packaging with high quality graphics and strength characteristics.
 Our recycling operations primarily procure recovered paper (also known as recycled fiber) from our converting facilities and from third parties, such as factories, warehouses, commercial printers, office complexes, grocery and retail stores, document storage facilities, paper converters and other wastepaper collectors. We handle a wide variety of grades of recovered paper, including old corrugated containers, office paper, box clippings, newspaper and print shop scraps. We operate recycling facilities that collect, sort, grade and bale recovered paper and, after sorting and baling, we transfer it to our containerboard and paperboard mills for processing or sell it principally to manufacturers of paperboard or containerboard in the United States (“U.S.”), as well as manufacturers of tissue, newsprint, roofing products and insulation, and to export markets. We operate a nationwide fiber marketing and brokerage system that serves large regional and national accounts, as well as our containerboard and paperboard mills, and sells scrap materials from our converting businesses and mills. Many of our recycling facilities are located close to our containerboard and paperboard mills, which helps promote the availability of supply with reduced shipping costs. We conduct our recycling operations as a procurement function, focusing on the procurement of low cost, high quality recycled fiber for our mill system and, therefore, we do not record recycling net sales and the margin from these operations has reduced cost of goods sold. 
 Sales of corrugated packaging products to external customers accounted for 65.4%, 64.6% and 64.2% of our net sales in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. See “Note 7. Segment Information” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, for additional information.
 Consumer Packaging Segment
 We operate integrated virgin and recycled fiber paperboard mills and consumer packaging converting operations, which convert items such as folding cartons, interior partitions, inserts and labels. Our integrated system of virgin and recycled mills produces paperboard for our converting operations and third parties. We internally consume or sell to manufacturers of folding cartons and other paperboard products our coated natural kraft, bleached paperboard and coated recycled paperboard, and internally consume or sell to manufacturers of solid fiber interior packaging, tubes and cores, book covers and other paperboard products our specialty recycled paperboard. The mill owned by our Seven Hills Paperboard LLC (“Seven Hills”) joint venture in Lynchburg, VA manufactures gypsum paperboard liner for sale to our joint venture partner.

We are one of the largest manufacturers of folding cartons in North America. We believe we are the largest manufacturer of solid fiber partitions in North America measured by net sales. Our folding cartons are used to package items such as food, paper, beverages, dairy products, tobacco, confectionery, health and beauty and other household consumer, commercial and industrial products, primarily for retail sale. Our folding cartons are also used by our customers to attract consumer attention at the point-of-sale. We manufacture express mail packages for the overnight courier industry, provide inserts and labels, as well as rigid packaging and other printed packaging products, such as transaction cards (e.g., credit, debit, etc.), brochures, product literature, marketing materials (such as booklets, folders, inserts, cover sheets and slipcases) and grower tags and plant stakes for the horticultural market. For the global healthcare market, we manufacture paperboard packaging for over-the-counter and prescription drugs. Our customers generally use our inserts and labels to provide customer product information either inside a secondary package (e.g., a folding carton) or affixed to the outside of a primary package (e.g., a bottle). Folding cartons typically protect customers’ products during shipment and distribution, and employ graphics to promote them at retail. We manufacture folding cartons from recycled and virgin paperboard, laminated paperboard and various substrates with specialty characteristics, such as grease masking and microwaveability. We print, coat, die-cut and glue the cartons to customer specifications and ship finished cartons to customers for assembling, filling and sealing. We employ a broad range of offset, flexographic, gravure, backside printing, coating and finishing technologies, as well as iridescent, holographic, textured and dimensional effects to provide differentiated packaging products, and support our customers with new package development, innovation and design services and package testing services. We manufacture and sell our solid fiber and corrugated partitions and die-cut paperboard components principally to glass container manufacturers, producers of beer, food, wine, spirits, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals, and the automotive industry.
 Sales of consumer packaging products to external customers accounted for 34.6%, 35.3% and 35.7% of our net sales in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. See “Note 7. Segment Information” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, for additional information.
 Land and Development Segment
 During fiscal 2020, we completed the monetization of the various real estate holdings that we owned that were concentrated in the Charleston, SC region. Sales in our Land and Development segment to external customers accounted for 0.1% and 0.1% of our net sales in fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. See “Note 7. Segment Information” for additional information. Following completion of the monetization of these assets, we ceased reporting the results of the Land and Development segment as a separate segment.
Seasonality
 While our businesses are not materially impacted by seasonality, there is some variability in demand that occurs from quarter to quarter, with net sales in the first quarter of each fiscal year typically being the lowest. As such, we disclose net sales, segment income and shipment data by segment by quarter in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”. Generally, we expect more of our earnings and cash flows to be generated in the second half of the fiscal year than in the first half of the fiscal year due to these variations and other factors, including the timing of scheduled mill maintenance outages.
Raw Materials
 The primary raw materials used by our mill operations are recycled fiber at our recycled containerboard and paperboard mills and virgin fiber from hardwoods and softwoods at our virgin containerboard and paperboard mills. Certain of our virgin containerboard is manufactured with some recycled fiber content. Our overall fiber sourcing for all of our mills is approximately 65% virgin and 35% recycled. See “Item 2. Properties” for additional information. Recycled fiber prices and virgin fiber prices can fluctuate significantly.
 Containerboard and paperboard are the primary raw materials used by our converting operations. Our converting operations use many different grades of containerboard and paperboard. We supply substantially all of our converting operations' needs for containerboard and paperboard from our own mills and through the use of trade swaps with other manufacturers. These arrangements allow us to optimize our mill system and reduce freight costs. Because there are other suppliers that produce the necessary grades of containerboard and paperboard used in our converting operations, we believe we would be able to source significant replacement quantities from other suppliers in the event that we incur production disruptions for recycled or virgin containerboard and 
 5


paperboard. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors — We May Face Increased Costs For, or Inadequate Availability of, Raw Materials, Energy and Transportation”.
 Energy
 Energy is one of the most significant costs of our mill operations. The cost of natural gas, coal, oil, electricity and wood by-products (biomass) at times has fluctuated significantly. In our coated and uncoated recycled paperboard mills, we use primarily natural gas and electricity to generate steam used in the paper making process. In our integrated kraft paper mills, we use natural gas, biomass, fuel oil and some coal to generate steam used in the pulping and paper making processes and to generate some or all of the electricity used on site. We primarily use electricity and natural gas to operate our converting facilities. We generally purchase these products from suppliers at market or tariff rates. See Item 1. “Business — Governmental Regulation — Environmental” for additional information. See also Item 1A. “Risk Factors — We May Face Increased Costs For, or Inadequate Availability of, Raw Materials, Energy and Transportation”. See also Item 7A. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk — “Energy” and “Derivative Instruments / Forward Contracts” for additional information regarding our energy consumption.
 Transportation
 Inbound and outbound freight is a significant cost for us. Factors that influence our freight expense are distance between our shipping and delivery locations, distance from our facilities to our customers and suppliers, mode of transportation (rail, truck, intermodal and ocean) and freight rates, which are influenced by supply and demand and fuel costs. We experienced higher freight costs in fiscal 2021 following a decline in fiscal 2020. The principal markets for our products are in North America, South America, Europe, Asia and Australia. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors — We May Face Increased Costs For, or Inadequate Availability of, Raw Materials, Energy and Transportation”.
 Sales and Marketing
 None of our external customers individually accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2021. We generally manufacture our products pursuant to our customers’ orders. We believe that we have good relationships with our customers. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors — We Depend on Certain Large Customers”.
 As a result of our vertical integration, our mills’ sales volumes may be directly impacted by changes in demand for our packaging products. During fiscal 2021, approximately two-thirds of our coated natural kraft tons shipped, approximately three-fifths of our coated recycled paperboard tons shipped and approximately one-fifth of our bleached paperboard tons shipped were delivered to our converting operations, primarily to manufacture folding cartons, and approximately four-fifths of our containerboard tons shipped, including trade swaps and buy/sell transactions, were delivered to our converting operations to manufacture corrugated products. Under the terms of our Seven Hills joint venture arrangement, our joint venture partner is required to purchase all of the qualifying gypsum paperboard liner produced by Seven Hills. Excluding the production from Seven Hills and from our Aurora, IL mill, which is converted into book covers and other products, approximately one-third of our specialty recycled paperboard tons shipped in fiscal 2021 were delivered to our converting operations, primarily to manufacture interior partitions. We have the ability to move our internal sourcing among certain of our mills to optimize the efficiency of our operations.
 As a result of our broad portfolio of differentiated and sustainable paper and packaging solutions, we serve more than 15,000 customers, including 188 customers who bought at least $1 million from each of our Corrugated Packaging and Consumer Packaging segments in fiscal 2021. We believe that our ability to leverage our full portfolio of differentiated solutions and capabilities enables us to set ourselves apart from our competitors.
 We market our products primarily through our own sales force. We also market a number of our products through independent sales representatives and independent distributors. We generally pay our sales personnel a combination of base salary, commissions and annual bonus. We pay our independent sales representatives on a commission basis. Orders from our customers generally do not have significant lead times. We discuss foreign net sales to unaffiliated customers and other non-U.S. operations’ financial and other segment information in “Note 7. Segment Information” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Competition
 We operate in a competitive global marketplace and compete with many large, well established and highly competitive manufacturers and service providers. Our business is affected by a range of macroeconomic conditions, including industry capacity changes, global competition, economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad, as well as fluctuations in currency exchange rates.
 The industries in which we operate are highly competitive, and no single company dominates any of those industries. Our containerboard and paperboard operations compete with integrated and non-integrated national and regional companies operating primarily in North America, and to a limited extent, manufacturers outside of North America. Our competitors include large and small, vertically integrated companies and numerous smaller non-integrated companies. In the corrugated packaging and folding carton markets, we compete with a significant number of national, regional and local packaging suppliers in North America and abroad. In the solid fiber interior packaging, promotional point-of-purchase display and converted paperboard products markets, we primarily compete with a smaller number of national, regional and local companies offering highly specialized products. 
 Since all of our businesses operate in highly competitive industry segments, we regularly discuss sales opportunities for new business or for renewal of existing business with customers. Our packaging products compete with packaging made from other materials, including plastics. The primary competitive factors we face include price, design, product innovation, quality, service and sustainability, with varying emphasis on these factors depending on the product line and customer preferences. Our machinery solutions represent one example of how we compete by providing differentiated solutions that create value for our customers. We believe that we compete effectively with respect to each of these factors and we obtain feedback on our performance with periodic customer surveys, among other means.
 The industries in which we operate have undergone consolidation. Within the packaging products industry, larger customers, with an expanded geographic presence, have tended to seek suppliers that can, because of their broad geographic presence, efficiently and economically supply all or a range of their packaging needs. In addition, our customers continue to demand higher quality products meeting stricter quality control requirements. Increasing demand for more sustainable products is also impacting our industry. See Item 1. “Business — Sustainability” for additional information.
 See Item 1A. “Risk Factors — We Face Intense Competition” and “Risk Factors — We May Be Adversely Affected by Factors That Are Beyond Our Control, Such as U.S. and Worldwide Economic and Financial Market Conditions, and Social and Political Change”.
 Governmental Regulation
 Health and Safety
 Our business involves the use of heavy equipment, machinery and chemicals and requires the performance of activities that create safety exposures. The health and safety of our teammates is our most important responsibility, and our goal is to create a 100% safe work environment for our team members. Our safety strategy focuses on People, Process, Prevention and Performance. We seek to reduce exposures and eliminate life changing events through engagement, execution of targeted, results-driven activities, and implementing systems that promote continuous improvement. Our commitment to safety is reinforced by our use of the WestRock Safety Excellence Management System, a robust safety program and training curriculum. 
 We are subject to a broad range of foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to occupational health and safety, and our safety program includes measures required for compliance. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, capital expenditures to meet our health and safety compliance requirements, as well as to continually improve our safety systems. We believe that future compliance with occupational health and safety laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
 The global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (“COVID-19”) continues to evolve and the extent of its effect on our operational and financial performance in future periods will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration, scope and severity of the pandemic (including due to new variants such as Delta), the actions taken to contain or mitigate its impact (including the 
 7


distribution and effectiveness of vaccines), and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and related containment measures and government responses, among others.
 On September 9, 2021, the Biden Administration announced a plan directing the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) to issue an emergency temporary standard (“ETS”) requiring all private employers with 100 or more workers to mandate COVID-19 vaccinations or a weekly test for all employees. The ETS was issued on November 5, 2021. On November 12, 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit issued an order staying enforcement and implementation of the ETS. We are assessing the anticipated requirements and monitoring future developments. We cannot currently assess the impact it will have on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows and it is possible that the operational impact and cost of compliance with the ETS may be substantial. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors — Our Business Has Been, and Will Continue to Be, Impacted by the Outbreak of the COVID-19 Novel Coronavirus”.
 Certain governmental authorities in locations where we do business have established asbestos standards for the workplace. Although we do not use asbestos in manufacturing our products, asbestos containing material (“ACM”) is present in some of the facilities we lease or own. For those facilities where ACM is present and ACM is subject to regulation, we have established procedures for properly managing it. 
 Environmental
 Environmental compliance requirements are a significant factor affecting our business. We employ manufacturing processes that involve discharges to water, air emissions, water intake and waste handling and disposal activities. These processes are subject to numerous federal, state, local and international environmental laws and regulations, as well as the requirements of environmental permits and similar authorizations issued by various governmental authorities. Complex and lengthy processes may be required to obtain and renew approvals, permits, and licenses for new, existing or modified facilities. Additionally, the use and handling of various chemicals or hazardous materials require release prevention plans and emergency response procedures. Our integrated chemical pulping mills in the U.S. and Brazil are subject to numerous and more complex environmental programs and regulations, but all of our manufacturing facilities have environmental compliance obligations. We have incurred, and expect that we will continue to incur, significant capital, operating and other expenditures to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations, including, for example, projects to replace and/or upgrade our air pollution control devices, wastewater treatment systems, and other environmental infrastructure. Changes in these laws, as well as litigation relating to these laws, could result in more stringent or additional environmental compliance obligations for the Company that may require additional capital investments or increase our operating costs.
 We are involved in various administrative and other proceedings relating to environmental matters that arise in the normal course of business, and we may become involved in similar matters in the future. Although the ultimate outcome of these proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty and we cannot at this time estimate any reasonably possible losses based on available information, we do not believe that the currently expected outcome of any environmental proceedings and claims that are pending or threatened against us will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
 We face potential liability under federal, state, local and international laws as a result of releases, or threatened releases, of hazardous substances into the environment from various sites owned and operated by third parties at which Company-generated wastes have allegedly been deposited. Generators of hazardous substances sent to off-site disposal locations at which environmental contamination exists, as well as the owners of those sites and certain other classes of persons, are liable for response costs for the investigation and remediation of such sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA”) and analogous laws. While joint and several liability is authorized under CERCLA, liability is typically shared with other potentially responsible parties (“PRPs”) and costs are commonly allocated according to relative amounts of waste deposited and other factors.
 In addition, certain of our current or former locations are being investigated or remediated under various environmental laws, including CERCLA. Based on information known to us and assumptions, we do not believe that the costs of these investigation and remediation projects will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. However, the discovery of contamination or the imposition of additional obligations, including natural resources damages at these or other sites in the future, could impact our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
 8


We believe that we can assert claims for indemnification pursuant to existing rights we have under certain purchase and other agreements in connection with certain remediation sites. In addition, we believe that we have insurance coverage, subject to applicable deductibles or retentions, policy limits and other conditions, for certain environmental matters. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful with respect to any claim regarding these insurance or indemnification rights or that, if we are successful, any amounts paid pursuant to the insurance or indemnification rights will be sufficient to cover all our costs and expenses. We also cannot predict with certainty whether we will be required to perform remediation projects at other locations, and it is possible that our remediation requirements and costs could increase materially in the future and exceed current reserves. In addition, we cannot currently assess with certainty the impact that future changes in cleanup standards or federal, state or other environmental laws, regulations or enforcement practices will have on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
 See Item 1A. “Risk Factors — We are Subject to a Wide Variety of Laws, Regulations and Other Requirements That are Subject to Change and May Impose Substantial Compliance Costs”.
 We estimate that we will invest approximately $21 million for capital expenditures during fiscal 2022 in connection with matters relating to environmental compliance. It is possible that our capital expenditure assumptions and project completion dates may change, and our projections are subject to change due to items such as the finalization of ongoing engineering projects or changes in environmental laws and regulations.
Climate Change

 Some of our paper mills, our most energy-intensive manufacturing facilities, burn renewable biomass to generate more than 60 percent of their energy needs based on overall fuel mix. Most of these facilities also self-generate the steam and power needed for their manufacturing processes using combined heat and power or “cogeneration” systems. Our recycling operations help to divert approximately seven to eight million tons of paper and packaging from landfills where it would otherwise degrade and release greenhouse gases in the form of methane. Our fiber procurement activities create economic incentives for landowners and family tree farmers to maintain their holdings as working forests that sequester carbon and provide many other environmental benefits, including protection for fresh water supplies and habitats for diverse species of plants and animals. 
 
In 2015, we established a goal to reduce our Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions per ton of production by 20% from a 2015 baseline by 2025. As of our September 30, 2020 reporting, we achieved a 14% reduction of greenhouse gas (“GHG”) per ton of production and an absolute reduction of 22% from our baseline. We have accomplished GHG reductions in our business primarily by displacing coal with natural gas and investing in new biomass boilers at our Covington, VA and Demopolis, AL mills. In June 2021, the Company announced that it will be working with the Science Based Targets initiative (“SBTi”) to set a new GHG emissions reduction target that is aligned with current climate science. 
 
Our Executive Leadership Team is actively involved in setting and executing our sustainability strategy, including climate-related initiatives such as setting a science-based GHG target. Board-level oversight of climate-related and other corporate sustainability matters resides with the Nominating & Governance Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors. The corporate sustainability team works with the Company’s operational and functional groups to incorporate sustainability and climate objectives into operations. The team also oversees the development of our sustainability report, which includes data on performance against climate-related targets. The corporate sustainability team reports to the President, Innovation, Commercial & Sustainability, who reports to the Chief Executive Officer.
 
Addressing issues related to climate change presents opportunities for our business. For example, we produce renewable energy and generate renewable energy credits (“RECs”) at our integrated kraft mills. We have sold RECs in the past and may sell them in the future. The RECs we generate are flexible, market-based tools that support the renewable energy market. Our recycling activities also may present the opportunity to generate offsets that could be used to meet climate-related obligations for ourselves or others.
 
Climate change also presents potential risks and uncertainties for us. With respect to physical climate risks, our manufacturing operations may be impacted by weather-related events, such as hurricanes and floods, potentially resulting in lost production, supply chain disruptions and increased material costs. Unpredictable weather patterns also may impact virgin fiber supplies and prices, which may fluctuate during prolonged periods of 
 9


heavy rain or drought. On the other hand, changes in climate also could result in more accommodating weather patterns for greater periods of time in certain areas, which may create favorable fiber market conditions. We incorporate a review of meteorological forecast data into our fiber procurement decisions and strategies. To the extent that climate-related risks materialize, and we are unprepared for them, we may incur unexpected costs, which could have a material effect on our financial results of operations.
 Responses to climate change may result in regulatory risks as new laws and regulations aimed at reducing GHG emissions come into effect. These rules and regulations could take the form of cap-and-trade, carbon taxes, or GHG reductions mandates for utilities that could increase the cost of purchased electricity. New climate rules and regulations also may result in higher fossil fuel prices or fuel efficiency standards that could increase transportation costs. Certain jurisdictions in which we have manufacturing facilities or other investments have already taken actions to address climate change. In the U.S., the EPA has issued the Clean Air Act permitting regulations applicable to certain facilities that emit GHG. The EPA also has promulgated a rule requiring certain industrial facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of carbon dioxide equivalent per year to file an annual report of their emissions. While we have facilities subject to existing GHG permitting and reporting requirements, the impact of these requirements has not been material to date.
 In addition to these national efforts, some U.S. states in which we have manufacturing operations, including Washington, New York and Virginia, are taking measures to reduce GHG emissions, such as requiring GHG emissions reporting or developing regional cap-and-trade programs. In addition, several of our international facilities are located in countries that have already adopted GHG emissions trading programs. Other countries in which we conduct business, including China, European Union member states and India, have set GHG reduction targets in accordance with the agreement signed in April 2016 among over 170 countries that established a framework for reducing global GHG emissions (also known as the “Paris Agreement”), which became effective in November 2016 and to which the United States formally rejoined in February 2021.
 Regulation related to climate change continues to develop in the areas of the world where we conduct business. We have systems in place for tracking the GHG emissions from our energy-intensive facilities, and we carefully monitor developments in climate related laws, regulations and policies to assess the potential impact of such developments on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and disclosure obligations. Compliance with climate programs may require future expenditures to meet GHG emission reduction obligations in future years. These obligations may include carbon taxes, the requirement to purchase GHG credits, or the need to acquire carbon offsets. Also, we may be required to make capital and other investments to displace traditional fossil fuels, such as fuel oil and coal, with lower carbon alternatives, such as biomass and natural gas. 
 Sustainability
 
At WestRock, we say sustainability is in every fiber of our company. Our vision, Imagining and Delivering on the Promise of a Sustainable Future, is represented by three pillars:
  
▪ | Supporting People and Communities
--+----------------------------------


▪ | Bettering the Planet
--+---------------------


▪ | Innovating for Our Customers and Their Customers
--+-------------------------------------------------

 
We deliver our fiber-based packaging solutions by way of our core purpose, Connecting People to Products®.
 WestRock is an example of the circular economy in action, from the renewable resources we use to manufacture our paperboard, to the recyclable packaging we make for our customers. Our recycling operations bring the process full circle by collecting recovered fiber that is used by our own paper mills and by others to produce new paper products. We have a long history of recycling and are one of the largest recyclers in the paper industry. We recover approximately seven to eight million tons annually of paper and other recyclable materials that might otherwise go into landfills. 
 All of our North American virgin fiber sourcing regions are certified to the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI®) Fiber Sourcing standard. Our forestland in Brazil is certified to the Brazilian Forest Certification Programme (CERFLOR®), the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC®) and the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC®). To provide traceability for the virgin fiber used in our operations, we have certified more than 95 percent of our wholly owned, fiber-based manufacturing facilities to three, internationally recognized chain-of-custody standards: SFI®, PEFC® and FSC®.

Employees
 At September 30, 2021, we employed approximately 49,900 people, of which approximately 78% were located in the U.S. and Canada and 22% were located in Europe, South America, Mexico and Asia Pacific. Of the approximately 49,900 employees, approximately 71% were hourly and 29% were salaried. Approximately 56% of our hourly employees in the U.S. and Canada are covered by collective bargaining agreements (“CBAs”), which typically have four to six-year terms. Approximately 26% of those employees covered under CBAs are operating under agreements that expire within one year and approximately 16% of those employees are working under expired contracts. 
 While we have experienced isolated work stoppages in the past, we have been able to resolve them, and we believe that working relationships with our employees are generally good. While the terms of our CBAs vary, we believe the material terms of the agreements are customary for the industry, the type of facility, the classification of the employees and the geographic location covered.
 In December 2019, the United Steelworkers Union (“USW”) ratified a new master agreement that applies to substantially all of our U.S. facilities represented by the USW. The agreement has a four-year term and covers a number of specific items, including wages, medical coverage and certain other benefit programs, substance abuse testing, and safety. Individual facilities will continue to have local agreements for subjects not covered by the master agreement and those agreements will continue to have staggered terms. The master agreement permits us to apply its terms to USW employees who work at facilities we acquire during the term of the agreement, including most former MeadWestvaco Corporation, KapStone and other acquired facilities. The master agreement covers approximately 65 of our U.S. operating locations and approximately 8,900 of our employees.
 See Item 1A. “Risk Factors — We May Be Adversely Impacted By Work Stoppages and Other Labor Relations Matters”.
 Human Capital
 Human Capital Management
The attraction, retention and development of exceptional teammates is critical to our success. We accomplish this, in part, by developing the capabilities of our team members through our continuous learning, development and performance management programs. These programs include our safety, six sigma, supply chain, Leadership Excellence, Commercial Excellence and Manager Fundamentals programs. We sponsor early in career rotations and college hire programs that support our functions and local operations. We build partnerships with schools, universities and associations to promote future careers in manufacturing.
 The capabilities of our workforce have evolved as our business and strategy have evolved. We have established new roles reflecting the talent and capabilities needed by our business, both now and for what we expect in the future. We created the roles of Chief Commercial Officer and Chief Innovation Officer, reflecting our evolving go-to-market strategy and our focus on innovation and organic growth. We invested in roles and 
 11


capabilities in our workforce to support our business strategy, including hiring a new Chief Marketing Officer, Chief Sustainability Officer and Senior Vice President of Science and Innovation. We have invested in our e-commerce and digital technology capabilities through new roles, talent and programs. These investments reflect our focus on enhancing our capabilities in the areas of sustainability, organic growth, innovation and material science. As our business evolves, we will remain focused on having the right human capital capabilities, systems and processes in place to support our strategy.
 Nevertheless, the market for both hourly workers and professional workers was particularly challenging in fiscal 2021 and we expect that the market for both hourly workers and professional workers will remain challenging at least through fiscal 2022. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors — We Operate in a Challenging Market for Talent and May Fail to Attract, Motivate, Train and Retain Qualified Personnel, Including Key Personnel”.
 Culture
 WestRock’s culture is grounded in our values:
  
▪ | Integrity – being honest and ethical, doing the right thing
--+------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Respect – treating one another with respect, and earning the respect of teammates, customers, suppliers through our actions
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Accountability – being responsible for our work and to our team. Collectively contributing to the success of our company and our customers
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | Excellence – striving to perform at the highest levels – for ourselves, our customers, investors and communities
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
At the core of our employee listening systems is our bi-annual engagement survey, which is augmented with employee pulse checks after hire and promotion, and exit interviews/surveys. These pulse checks/surveys enable us to gather feedback directly from our workforce to inform our programs and employee needs globally. Approximately 86% of team members globally participated in our fiscal 2021 WestRock engagement survey, which covers topics such as company strategy and direction, leadership, inclusion, safety, culture, pay and benefits, and learning and development.
 Safety
 The health and safety of our teammates is our most important responsibility, and our goal is to create a 100% safe work environment for our team members. Throughout the COVID-19 crisis, we have remained focused on protecting the health and safety of our team members while meeting the needs of our customers. Shortly after the outset of COVID-19, we were an early adopter of enhanced safety measures and practices across our facilities to protect employee health and safety and ensure a reliable supply of essential products to our customers. We monitor and track the impact of the pandemic on our teammates and within our operations, and proactively modify or adopt new practices to promote their health and safety.
 We implemented a wide variety of measures to protect the health and well-being of our employees, suppliers, and customers during the COVID-19 pandemic. We made substantial modifications to travel policies and implemented office and manufacturing protocols to include quarantine, cleaning and sanitizing, and childcare support. We reconfigured manufacturing processes and lines to create distance and improved ventilation, where needed. We also provided on-site flu and COVID vaccination clinics and extended our existing Employee Assistance Program and other community resources to help with personal and family care. See Item 1. “Business — Governmental Regulation — Health & Safety” for more information on safety.
 Diversity, Inclusion, Equity and Belonging
 Our Diversity, Inclusion, Equity and Belonging objective is to be a company where each of us genuinely belongs, is respected and valued, and can do our best work, and where diversity, inclusion and equity are competitive advantages.
 At September 30, 2021, 21% of our global workforce was comprised of females and 33% of our U.S. based workforce was comprised of people of color. Our board of directors includes four females (representing 36% of directors) and one person of color (representing 9% of directors). We have implemented a multi-year Diversity, Inclusion, Equity and Belonging action plan that we expect will increase our workforce diversity, advance inclusion, 
 12


equity and belonging at all our locations, accelerate the development and career movement of diverse talent and ensure diverse succession plans such that we continue to create future opportunities for all of our teammates. For instance, in October 2020, management recommended, and the board of directors approved, several actions aimed at increasing our diversity and advancing our inclusive environment. One program that has contributed to our overall progress involves the internal and external posting of our open positions and the inclusion of female and racially or ethnically diverse candidates on our recruitment slates. In addition, we adopted an approach where new management-supported director nominees and chief executive officers recruited from outside WestRock are chosen by the board of directors. We set a four-year goal for gender and ethnic representation that aligns with our long-term expectations for creating a truly diverse and inclusive organization – one that reflects our customers and communities.
 We included a diversity, inclusion, equity and belonging modifier in our fiscal 2021 short-term incentive plan for our top 12 executives. The modifier was tied to the achievement of certain performance measures under our Diversity, Inclusion, Equity and Belonging action plan. We expect the diversity, inclusion, equity and belonging modifier to be applied to approximately 100 of our top executives and leaders in fiscal 2022.
 In collaboration with organizations, such as the Executive Leadership Council, Pathways and Signature, we are providing external development opportunities for our diverse talent. To connect and develop team members within WestRock, we support highly engaged resource groups for early in career, women, racial and ethnic minorities, military, people with different abilities, or who identify as LGBTQI+, where team members can go for support, networking, and community-building.
 We conduct pay equity analyses annually in the U.S., Great Britain and France to help identify any unsupported distinctions in pay between team members of different races, gender and/or age, as permitted by local law. We adjust base pay, where appropriate.
 Talent Attraction, Retention and Development
 During fiscal 2021, we continued investing in people, programs and systems to meet the increased talent demand in a dynamic marketplace. We have expanded our relationships with Historically Black Colleges and Universities, the National Association of Manufacturers and other partners and associations. To retain critical operational talent in hyper labor markets and businesses, we have restructured work schedules, updated work rules, and provided retention bonuses, where needed.
 To ensure team members get off to a fast start, we provided new employee orientations to over 10,000 new hires in fiscal 2021, covering a range of topics including company values, culture, diversity and inclusion and Standards of Business Conduct. In fiscal 2021, WestRock launched our on-line learning library with over 1,000 courses in five languages, and with over 200 playlists by topic area or experience/skill set. 
 We invest in our senior leadership through a leadership excellence program, and developed new front-line management pilot programs to be launched in fiscal 2022. Commercial team members participate in an assessment and development workshop which focuses on the capabilities needed today and tomorrow, ensuring we are able to anticipate and meet our customers’ changing requirements. We continue to invest in our technical development curriculum with a focus on building the best technical, engineering, operational talent. 
 Focused on our core company values, all team members complete required learning programs like Standards of Business Conduct, Privacy, and preventing harassment courses.
 International Operations
 Our operations outside the U.S. are conducted through subsidiaries located in Canada, Mexico, South America, Europe, Asia and Australia. Sales attributable to non-U.S. operations were 18.5%, 17.7% and 18.2% of our net sales in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, some of which were transacted in U.S. dollars. See “Note 7. Segment Information” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. See also Item 1A. “Risk Factors — We are Exposed to Risks Related to International Sales and Operations”.
