Item 1.    Business
Overview
Horizon Global Corporation, which we refer to herein as “Horizon,” “Horizon Global,” “we” or the “Company,” became an independent, publicly traded company as the result of a tax-free spin-off (the “Spin-off”) from TriMas Corporation (“TriMas”) on June 30, 2015. The Company’s common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the ticker symbol “HZN” on July 1, 2015.
We are a leading designer, manufacturer and distributor of a wide variety of high-quality, custom-engineered towing, trailering, cargo management and other related accessory products on a global basis, serving the automotive original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and servicers (“OESs”) (collectively “OEs”), industrial, aftermarket, retail and e-commerce channels. 
The Company groups its business into operating segments by the region in which sales and manufacturing efforts are focused. As a result of the Company’s sale of its Horizon Asia-Pacific operating segment (“APAC”) on September 19, 2019, the Company has two remaining operating segments, Horizon Americas and Horizon Europe-Africa. For additional information regarding the sale of the APAC segment, refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations, included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” within this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Horizon Americas has operations in North and South America, primarily operating in the United States, Mexico, Canada and Brazil, and is generally a leader in towing and trailering-related products sold through the automotive OE, industrial, aftermarket, retail and e-commerce channels, especially in North America. Horizon Europe‑Africa focuses their sales and manufacturing efforts outside of North and South America. Horizon Europe‑Africa operates primarily in Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Romania and South Africa. We believe Horizon Europe‑Africa has been a leader in towing related products sold primarily through automotive OE and aftermarket channels in its segment. 
Our products are used in two primary categories across the world: commercial applications, or “Work,” and recreational activities, or “Play.” Some of the markets in our Work category include agricultural, automotive, construction, fleet, industrial, marine, military, mining and municipalities. Some of the markets in our Play category include equestrian, power sports, recreational vehicle, specialty automotive, truck accessory and other specialty towing applications. We believe that the primary brands we offer are among the most recognized in the markets we serve and are known for quality, safety and performance. 
We believe no individual competitor serving the sales channels we participate in can match our broad product portfolio. Our products reach end consumers through multiple sales channels which we categorize as follows:

▪ | Automotive OEM and Automotive OES (collectively, “Automotive OE”): The automotive OEM sales channel represents sales to automotive vehicle manufacturers while automotive OES primarily represents sales to automotive vehicle dealerships. We primarily sell our towing products to the automotive OEM and automotive OES sales channels. This product category includes devices and accessories installed on a tow-vehicle for the purpose of attaching a trailer, camper, etc., such as hitches/tow bars, fifth wheels, gooseneck hitches, weight distribution systems, brake controls, wiring harnesses, draw bars, ball mounts, crossbars, security and other towing accessories.


▪ | Industrial: This sales channel represents sales to non-automotive manufacturers and dealers of agricultural equipment, trailers and other custom assemblies. We primarily sell our trailering products to the industrial sales channel. This product category includes control devices and components of the trailer itself, such as brake controls, jacks, winches, couplers, interior and exterior vehicle lighting and brake replacement parts.


▪ | Aftermarket: This sales channel represents sales to automotive installers and warehouse distributors. In addition to selling our towing and trailering products to the aftermarket sales channel, we also sell our cargo management and “other” products to this sales channel. The cargo management product category includes a wide variety of products used to facilitate the transportation of various forms of cargo, to secure that cargo or to organize items. Examples of these products are bike racks, roof cross bar systems, cargo carriers, luggage boxes, car interior protective products, rope, tie-downs, tarps, tarp straps, bungee cords, loading ramps and interior travel organizers. The “other” product category includes a diverse range of items in our portfolio that do not fit into towing, trailering or cargo management categories. Examples of these products include tubular push bars, side steps, sports bars, skid plates and oil pans.

▪ | Retail: This sales channel represents sales to direct-to-consumer retailers, such as traditional brick and mortar merchants. While we offer a majority of our products to the retail sales channel, we primarily focus on towing and cargo management products in this sales channel.


▪ | E-commerce: This sales channel represents sales to direct-to-consumer retailers who utilize the Internet to purchase the Company’s products. Similar to the retail sales channel, we offer a majority of our products to the e-commerce sales channel, with a focus on towing and cargo management products.

We have positioned our product portfolio to create a variety of options based on price-point, ranging from entry-level to premium-level products across most of our markets. We believe the brands we offer in our aftermarket channel have significant customer recognition, with the three most significant being Reese®, Draw-Tite® and Westfalia®. We believe all three have substantial market share and have been leading brands in the towing market for over 50 years. These brands provide the foundation of our market position based on worldwide commercial and consumer acceptance. We also maintain a collection of regionally recognized brands that include Aqua Clear™, Bulldog®, BTM, DHF, Engetran, Fulton®, Kovil, Reese Secure™, Reese Explorer™, Reese Power Sports, Reese Towpower™, ROLA®, Tekonsha®, Trojan®, WesBarg® and Witter Towbar Systems.
Our Industry
Our products are sold into a diverse set of end-markets; the primary applications relate to automotive accessories for light and recreational vehicles. Purchases of automotive accessory parts are discretionary, and we believe demand is driven by macro-economic factors including (i) employment trends, (ii) consumer sentiment and (iii) fuel prices, among others.
We believe each of these metrics impact both our Work- and Play-related sales. In addition, we believe the Play-related sales are more sensitive to changes in these indices, given the Play-related sales tend to be more directly related to disposable income levels. In general, unemployment in the United States and European Union has decreased in recent periods and consumer sentiment and fuel prices have been stable in these markets. We believe these are positive trends for our businesses.
Automotive OE and Industrial Channels
While automotive OE and industrial channel demand is typically driven by planned production, suppliers also grow by increasing their product content on each unit produced through sales of existing product lines or expansion into new product line offerings. Given the consolidation and globalization throughout the industry, suppliers combining a global presence with strong engineering, technology, manufacturing, supply chain and customer support will be best positioned to take advantage of Automotive OE and industrial business opportunities. 
More recent trends in the global automotive OE and industrial supplier market include:

▪ | Global Platform/Supplier Consolidation: Automotive OEs are adopting global vehicle platforms to decrease product development costs and increase manufacturing efficiency and profitability. As a result, Automotive OEs are selecting suppliers that have the capacity to manufacture and deliver products on a worldwide basis as well as the flexibility to adapt products to local variations. Suppliers with a global supply chain and efficient manufacturing capabilities are best positioned to benefit from this trend. We believe we are uniquely positioned to take advantage of this trend as a result of our global manufacturing footprint, highly developed supply chain relationships and track record of success in solving application challenges in our product lines;


▪ | Outsourcing of Design and Manufacturing of Vehicle Parts and Systems: Automotive OEs continually strive to simplify their assembly processes, lower costs and reduce development times. As a result, they have increasingly relied on suppliers to perform many of the design, engineering, research and development and assembly functions traditionally performed by automotive OEs. Suppliers with extensive design and engineering capabilities are in the best position to benefit from this trend as they are able to offer value-added solutions with superior features and convenience. We believe certain automotive OEs have sought us out to assist with their engineering challenges to increase towing capacity and for the many solutions provided by our existing products; and


▪ | Shorter Product Development Cycles: Due to frequent shifts in government regulations and customer preferences, OEs are requiring suppliers to continue to provide new designs and product innovations. These trends are prevalent in mature markets as well as, emerging markets, which are advancing rapidly towards the regulatory standards and consumer preferences of the more mature markets. Suppliers with strong technologies, robust engineering and development capabilities are best positioned to meet OE demands for rapid innovation. Our broad product offerings, product expertise, and global engineering footprint enables us to rapidly deploy solutions meeting the changing customer needs.

Aftermarket, Retail and E-Commerce Channels
We sell our products in these sales channels to a wide range of customers, including national and regional distributors, installers, and both traditional brick and mortar and e-commerce merchants, including automotive, home hardware, farm and fleet, and mass merchants. More recent trends in these sales channels include:

▪ | Channel Consolidation: In the more mature market of the United States, there has been increasing consolidation in distribution networks with larger, more sophisticated aftermarket distributors and retailers gaining market share. In kind, these distributors generally require larger, more sophisticated suppliers with product expertise, category management and supply chain services and capabilities, as well as a global manufacturing and services footprint. We provide customers in this category the opportunity to rationalize their supply base of vendors in our product lines by virtue of our broad offering and product expertise; and


▪ | Growth of Online Capabilities: Reaching consumers directly through online capabilities, including e-commerce, is having an increasing impact on the global automotive aftermarket and retail channels. Establishment of a robust online presence is critical for suppliers regardless of whether or not they participate directly in e-commerce. We believe we are positioned well to take advantage of this continuing trend, given our established online presence. We support consumers by offering a wide range of information on our products and services, including installation videos, custom-fit guides and links to authorized dealers and both brick and mortar and e-commerce merchants.

Competitive Strengths
We believe our operating segments share and benefit from the following competitive strengths:

▪ | Diverse Product Portfolio of Market Leading Brands. We believe we benefit from a diverse portfolio of high-quality and highly-engineered products sold under globally recognized and market leading brand names. By offering a wide range of products, we are able to provide a complete solution to satisfy our customers’ towing, trailering and cargo management needs, as well as serve diverse channels through effective brand management. Our brands are well-known in their respective product areas and channels. We believe that we are the leading supplier of towing products and among the leading suppliers of trailering products globally.


▪ | Global Scale with Flexible Manufacturing Footprint and Supply Chain. We were built through internal growth and a series of acquisitions to become the only truly global automotive accessories company with the products we offer. We have the ability to produce low-volume, customized, quick-turn products in our global manufacturing facilities, while our sourcing arrangements with third-party suppliers provides us with the flexibility to manufacture or source high-volume products as end-market demand fluctuates. Our flexible manufacturing capability, low-cost manufacturing facilities and established supply chain allow us to quickly and efficiently respond to changes in end-market demand.


▪ | Long-Term Relationships with a Diverse Customer Base. Our customers encompass a broad range of OEs, mass merchants, e-commerce websites, distributors, dealers, and independent installers, representing multiple channels to reaching the end consumer. Blue chip customers include Ford Motor Company, FCA, Volkswagen, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, AutoZone, Amazon, Toyota, Canadian Tire, LKQ, U-Haul, Home Depot and Etrailer, among others. Our customer relationships are well established, with many exceeding 20 years. These strong partnerships can provide stability to our revenue base through economic cycles. We believe our diverse product portfolio, global scale and flexible manufacturing capabilities enable us to provide a unique value proposition to customers. 


▪ | Globally Competitive Cost Structure. Since becoming an independent public company, we have focused on margin improvement activities, identifying and acting on projects to reduce our cost structure. With focused, identifiable projects under way or complete, we believe we should benefit from improved operating margins and cash flow that can then be deployed to high-value creation activities. The combination of our strong brand names, leading market position, flexible manufacturing and sourcing operations have historically resulted in significant cash flow generation.

Key Business Priorities
Horizon Global established the following strategic platforms for value creation focused on business improvement and transformation, supported by a company culture of continuous improvement.

▪ | Capital Structure. Our first priority is to continue to improve our capital structure with a continued reduction in leverage over time. We aim to accomplish this goal through cash flow generation and improved liquidity management following the sale of our APAC business and our other key business priorities.


▪ | Margin Expansion. Our second priority is to drive the organization to an operating margin that is competitive with or above industry expectations. We believe the investments made in our facilities and equipment over the past few years, along with our efforts to realign our operations, should provide the foundation for additional margin expansion. We are developing an organization in which all team members are focused on constantly improving the efficiency of all operations through the adoption of lean and continuous improvement practices.


▪ | Operational Stabilization. Our third priority is to stabilize existing operations after significant management changes and changes in our distribution footprint in the Americas and manufacturing footprint in Europe-Africa during 2019. We aim to have our distribution centers and manufacturing facilities operating efficiently and effectively to meet peak demand during our traditional summer selling season in 2020.


▪ | Organic Growth. Our fourth priority is to grow the business 3% to 5% on an organic basis, annually. We have identified areas of focused growth activities, involving geographic markets and sales channels, which we believe are particularly aligned with our competitive strengths. 

Growth Strategies
We believe that we have multiple opportunities to integrate, improve and grow our business, whether via organic initiatives, via new geographies or new product development, through the following strategies:

▪ | Balanced Original Equipment and Aftermarket Growth. The global market for accessories and vehicle personalization is increasing across channels. Automotive manufacturers are looking for suppliers to partner with to create genuine accessories to meet this need. Historically, this has been undertaken as a regional effort, but the growth of global automotive OE has increased the need for global suppliers. Our geographic footprint, existing customer relationships and the increase in global vehicle platforms align to present us with unique opportunities to grow with our automotive OE customers. The Company is positioned to balance and leverage the OE growth with growth in the aftermarket as we have significant brand recognition and strategic distributor and customer relationships.


▪ | E-commerce. We will continue to leverage the breadth of our product portfolio and global manufacturing footprint by continuing to expand our presence in the high growth e-commerce channel. This strategy is applicable in our developed markets where a focus on content delivery and customer support drive growth. It is also a powerful tool as we look at developing new, less mature markets around the world, enabling a direct connection with the users of our product set.


▪ | Low Cost Countries. We believe our manufacturing presence in Mexico and Romania provides opportunities for growth, while supporting both new and existing global customers in a cost-effective manner. When leveraged appropriately, it allows us to manufacture and distribute our products in a localized and regionalized manner efficiently and supports having the right product in the right place to best serve customer and end market needs.


▪ | Product Innovation. Our presence in the OE channels and multiple geographic markets allows us to leverage development costs and product innovation tied to new vehicles across our entire global footprint.

Marketing, Customers and Distribution
Horizon employs a dedicated sales force in each of our primary channels. In serving our customers globally, we rely upon our strong historical customer relationships, custom engineering capability, brand recognition, broad product offerings, our established distribution network and varied merchandising strategies to bolster our towing, trailering, cargo management and accessory product sales. Significant Horizon customers include Ford Motor Company, FCA, Volkswagen, BMW and Toyota in the OE channel; Tractor Supply Company and O’Reilly Auto Parts in the retail channel; Amazon and Etrailer in the E-commerce channel; and LKQ, U-Haul and Redneck Trailer Supplies in the aftermarket channel. No customer represented greater than 10% of total revenue during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.
Competition
The competitive environment for automotive accessory products is highly fragmented and is characterized by numerous smaller suppliers, even the largest of which tend to focus in narrow product categories. We believe there is no individual competitor that has the breadth of product portfolio on a global basis in the markets we serve. Significant towing competitors include Curt Manufacturing, B&W Trailer Hitches, Husky Towing Products, Winston Products, The Bosal Group, Brink Group, Buyers Products Company, Demco Products, PullRite, Westin Automotive Products and Camco. Significant trailering competitors include Pacific Rim, Dutton-Lainson, SAF-Holland, Demco Products, Jost International and Sea-Sense. In addition, competitors in the cargo management product category include Thule, Yakima, Bell, Masterlock and Saris.
Materials and Supply Arrangements
We procure a variety of materials from a global supplier base from around the world. We are sensitive to price movements in our raw materials supply base. Our largest material purchases are for steel, copper, and aluminum. We also consume a significant amount of energy via utilities in our facilities. Historically, when we have experienced increasing costs of steel, we have successfully passed those through to our customers, although sometimes with a delay due to competitive pressure.
Employees and Labor Relations
As of December 31, 2019, we employed approximately 3,600 people, of which approximately 12% were located in the United States. In the United States, we have no collective bargaining agreements. Employee relations have generally been satisfactory.
Seasonality and Backlog
We experience some seasonality in our business. Sales of towing and trailering products in the northern hemisphere, where we generate the majority of our sales, are generally stronger in the second and third calendar quarters, as trailer OEs, distributors and retailers acquire product for the spring and summer selling seasons. The Company’s businesses in the southern hemisphere are stronger in the first and fourth calendar quarters. In addition, within the OE channels, there is moderate seasonality due to production schedules and the launch of component production for new vehicle models, which generally occurs in the third calendar quarter of the year. Accordingly, our results reflect any seasonality we may experience. We normally do not consider order backlog to be a material factor in our businesses.
Environmental Matters
We are subject to U.S. federal, state and local, and non-U.S. international environmental and safety and health laws and regulations, including those relating to air emissions, wastewater discharges and chemical and hazardous waste management and disposal. Some of these environmental laws hold owners or operators of land or businesses liable for their own and for previous owners’ or operators’ releases of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes. Other environmental laws and regulations require the obtainment and compliance with environmental permits. To date, costs of complying with environmental, health and safety requirements have not been material. However, the nature of our operations and our long history of industrial activities at certain of our current or former facilities, as well as those acquired, could potentially result in material environmental liabilities.
While we must comply with existing and pending climate change legislation, regulation and international treaties or accords, current laws and regulations have not had a material impact on our business, capital expenditures or financial position. Future events, including those relating to climate change or greenhouse gas regulation could require us to incur expenses related to the modification or curtailment of operations, installation of pollution control equipment or investigation and cleanup of contaminated sites.

International Operations
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 (“4Q19 YTD”), 47.5% of our net sales were derived outside of the United States. In addition, 66.2% of our consolidated property and equipment, net as of December 31, 2019 were located outside of the United States. We operate manufacturing facilities in Brazil, France, Germany, Romania, Mexico, and South Africa.
