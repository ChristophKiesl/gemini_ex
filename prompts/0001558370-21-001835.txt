ITEM 1.BUSINESS
Introduction
We are the largest regional theme park operator in the world and the largest operator of waterparks in North America based on the number of parks we operate. Of our 26 regional theme parks and waterparks, 23 are located in the United States, two are located in Mexico and one is located in Montreal, Canada. Our U.S. parks serve each of the top 11 designated market areas, as determined by a survey of television households within designated market areas published by A.C. Nielsen Media Research in September 2019. Our diversified portfolio of North American parks serves an aggregate population of approximately 145 million people and 250 million people within a radius of 50 miles and 100 miles, respectively, with some of the highest per capita gross domestic product in the U.S.
Our parks occupy approximately 6,000 acres of land, and we own approximately 700 additional acres of land with development potential. Our parks are located in geographically diverse markets across North America. Our parks generally offer a broad selection of state-of-the-art and traditional thrill rides, water attractions, themed areas, concerts and shows, restaurants, game venues and retail outlets, and thereby provide a complete family-oriented entertainment experience. In the aggregate, during 2020, our parks contained approximately 940 rides, including over 150 roller coasters, making us the leading provider of "thrill rides" in the industry.
In 1998, we acquired the former Six Flags Entertainment Corporation ("Former SFEC", a corporation that has been merged out of existence and that had always been a separate corporation from Holdings), which had operated regional theme parks and waterparks under the Six Flags name for nearly forty years and established an internationally recognized brand name. We own the "Six Flags" brand name in the U.S. and foreign countries throughout the world. To capitalize on this name recognition, 22 of our parks are branded as "Six Flags" or "Hurricane Harbor" parks, and we also began the development, with a third party partner, of a Six Flags-branded theme park in Saudi Arabia.
We hold exclusive long-term licenses for theme park usage of certain Warner Bros. and DC Comics characters throughout the U.S. (except the Las Vegas metropolitan area), Canada, Mexico and other countries. These characters include Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Tweety Bird, Yosemite Sam, Batman, Superman, The Joker, Wonder Woman, The Flash, Green Lantern, Harley Quinn, Aquaman, and others. We use these characters to provide an enhanced family entertainment experience. Our licenses include the right to sell merchandise featuring the characters at the parks, and to use the characters in our advertising, as walk-around characters and in theming for rides, attractions and retail outlets. 
We believe our parks benefit from limited direct theme park competition. A limited supply of real estate appropriate for theme park development, substantial initial capital investment requirements, long development lead-time, and zoning restrictions provide each of our parks with a significant degree of protection from competitive new theme park openings. Based on our knowledge of the development of our own and other regional theme parks, we estimate it would cost $500 million to $700 million and would take a minimum of four years to construct a new regional theme park comparable to one of our major Six Flags-branded theme parks.

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business has been more substantial than any other event throughout our history. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, federal, state and local governments implemented significant restrictions on travel, social conduct and business operations, including mass quarantine and social distancing mandates and orders. The pandemic and these containment measures have had, and may continue to have, a material negative impact on our business and financial performance. On March 13, 2020, we temporarily suspended operations at all our theme parks and waterparks due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Through concerted action, we quickly implemented plans to mitigate the crisis and position us for future success while ensuring the health and safety of our employees and guests. As a result of these actions, all of our theme parks and some of our waterparks operated in at least some capacity for a portion of the season, albeit pursuant to reduced capacity and other operating limitations. Highlights included (i) implementation of cost controls, including company-wide salary reductions, and curtailed advertising, marketing and capital expenditures, (ii) strengthening of liquidity, including increased revolving credit, suspended testing of certain covenants in our credit facility, and raising of additional debt, (iii) development of industry-leading safety measures, including a reservation system to control park capacity, protocols to ensure proper social distancing, contactless security, and enhanced sanitization measures, (iv) development of measures to retain our season pass holders and members, including extending all 2020 season passes through the end of 2021, offering members the option to pause payments, and offering higher-tiered benefits to members who maintain their payment schedule, and (v) creation of new sources of revenue including the Six Flags Wild Safari Drive-Through Adventure, Six Flags Discovery Kingdom Marine World Experience and Holiday in the Park Drive-Through and Walk-Through Experiences.
Transformation Plan
Prior to the pandemic, we initiated a transformation plan. The transformation plan consists of five revenue initiatives and three cost initiatives designed to improve our core operational effectiveness and to support our strategy, delivering sustainable value creation over time. Our strategy is to create thrilling, memorable experiences at our regional parks, delivered by a diverse and empowered team, through industry-leading innovation and technology. The strategy is driven by three focus areas: (i) modernizing the guest experience through technology, (ii) continuously improving operational efficiency, and (iii) driving financial excellence. We plan to focus on our core business over the next two to three years; during this time, we will be cautious about expanding into adjacent domestic markets or entering into new international agreements.
Due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020 and the resulting park closures, management redirected its focus on steering us through this crisis, causing a delay in our transformation plan. However, in the latter half of 2020, we made significant progress on each of the initiatives. For example, in October 2020, we reduced our full-time headcount costs by approximately 10%. We closed two satellite offices; initiated centralized negotiations with several vendors to reduce procurement costs; and piloted a model to optimize park level variable labor. From a revenue perspective, we improved our menu assortment, pricing and merchandizing strategy; developed a new tool to optimize media spending; improved our website; and made progress on our initiative to attract more single day visitors.
We expect the transformation plan to generate an incremental $80 to $110 million in annual run-rate Adjusted EBITDA. We expect to realize $30 to $35 million of benefits in 2021, independent of attendance levels, and to achieve the remaining benefits through incremental revenue opportunities and lower variable costs once the plan is fully implemented and the Company is operating in a normal business environment. Relative to the mid-point of the Company’s pre-pandemic guidance range of $450 million, this implies a new earnings baseline of $530 to $560 million once the plan is fully implemented and the Company is operating in a normal business environment. Description of Parks and Segment Information
Our parks provide similar products and services through a similar process to the same class of customer through a consistent method. We also believe our parks share common economic characteristics. Based on these factors, we have only one reportable segment—theme parks. The following chart summarizes key business and geographical information about our parks.

Partnership Park Arrangements
In connection with our 1998 acquisition of Former SFEC, we guaranteed certain obligations relating to Six Flags Over Texas ("SFOT") and Six Flags Over Georgia, including Six Flags White Water Atlanta ("SFOG", and together with SFOT, the "Partnership Parks"). These obligations continue until 2027, in the case of SFOG, and 2028, in the case of SFOT. Such obligations include (i) minimum annual distributions (including rent) of approximately $75.2 million in 2021 (subject to cost of living adjustments in subsequent years) to the limited partners in the Partnerships Parks (based on our ownership of units as of December 31, 2020, our share of the distribution will be approximately $33.3 million) and (ii) minimum capital expenditures at each park during rolling five-year periods based generally on 6% of Partnership Park revenues. Cash flow from operations at the Partnership Parks is used to satisfy these requirements before any funds are required from us. We also guaranteed the obligation of our subsidiaries to annually purchase all outstanding limited partnership units to the extent tendered by the unit holders (the "Partnership Park Put").
After payment of the minimum distribution, we are entitled to a management fee equal to 3% of prior year gross revenues and, thereafter, any additional cash will be distributed first to management fee in arrears, then repayment of any interest and principal on intercompany loans, with any additional cash being distributed 95% to us, in the case of SFOG, and 92.5% to us, in the case of SFOT.
The agreed price for units tendered in the Partnership Park Put is based on a valuation of each of the respective Partnership Parks (the "Specified Price") that is the greater of (i) a valuation for each of the respective Partnership Parks derived by multiplying such park’s weighted average four year EBITDA (as defined in the agreements that govern the partnerships) by a specified multiple (8.0 in the case of SFOG and 8.5 in the case of SFOT) and (ii) a valuation derived from the highest prices previously paid for the units of the Partnership Parks by certain entities. In light of the temporary suspension of operations of the Partnership Parks due to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, which would cause the value of the limited partnership units of the Partnership Parks to decrease in 2021 and thereafter, we adjusted our annual offer to purchase these units to set a minimum price floor for all future purchases. Pursuant to the valuation methodologies described in the preceding sentence, the Specified Price for the Partnership Parks, if determined as of December 31, 2020, is $409.7 million in the case of SFOG, and $527.4 million in the case of SFOT. As of December 31, 2020, we owned approximately 31.4% and 53.9% of the Georgia limited partner interests and Texas limited partner interests, respectively. The remaining redeemable units of approximately 68.6% and 46.1% of the Georgia limited partner and Texas limited partner, respectively, represent a current redemption value for the limited partnership units of approximately $523.4 million.
Pursuant to the 2020 annual offer, we purchased 0.375 units from the Georgia partnership for approximately $1.5 million and we purchased 1.5675 units from the Texas partnership for approximately $3.4 million in May 2020. The $350 million accordion feature on the Second Amended and Restated Term Loan B under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Facility (as defined in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report) is available for borrowing for future "put" obligations if necessary.
In connection with our acquisition of the Former SFEC, we entered into the Subordinated Indemnity Agreement with certain of the Company’s entities, Time Warner, and an affiliate of Time Warner (an indirect subsidiary of AT&T Inc. as a result of a merger in 2018), pursuant to which, among other things, we transferred to Time Warner (which has guaranteed all of our obligations under the Partnership Park arrangements) record title to the corporations that own the entities that have purchased and will purchase limited partnership units of the Partnership Parks, and we received an assignment from Time Warner of all cash flow received on such limited partnership units, and we otherwise control such entities. In addition, we issued preferred stock of the managing partner of the partnerships to Time Warner. In the event of a default by us under the Subordinated Indemnity Agreement or of our obligations to our partners in the Partnership Parks, these arrangements would permit Time Warner to take full control of both the entities that own limited partnership units and the managing partner. If we satisfy all such obligations, Time Warner is required to transfer to us the entire equity interests of these entities. The 2018 merger of Time Warner and AT&T Inc. did not affect the Time Warner guarantee of our obligations under the Subordinated Indemnity Agreement.

We incurred $9.1 million of capital expenditures at these parks during the 2020 season, and intend to incur an amount in excess of the minimum required expenditure in 2021. Cash flows from operations at the Partnership Parks will be used to satisfy the annual distribution and capital expenditure requirements before any funds are required from us. The two partnerships used approximately $8.4 million of cash in 2020 in operating activities after deduction of capital expenditures and excluding the impact of short-term intercompany advances from or payments to Holdings, as the case may be. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had total loans receivable outstanding of $288.3 million and $239.3 million, respectively, from the partnerships that own the Partnership Parks. The proceeds from these loans were primarily used to fund the acquisition of Six Flags White Water Atlanta and to make capital improvements and distributions to the limited partners.
Marketing and Promotion
We attract visitors through multichannel marketing and promotional programs for each of our parks. The programs are designed to attract guests and enhance the Six Flags brand name and are tailored to address the different characteristics of our various markets and to maximize the impact of specific park attractions and product introductions. Marketing and promotional programs are updated or replaced each year to address new developments. These initiatives are supervised by our senior marketing and sales leadership teams, with the assistance of our senior management and advertising and promotion agencies.
We also develop alliance, sponsorship and co-marketing relationships with well-known national, regional and local consumer goods companies and retailers to supplement our advertising efforts and to provide attendance incentives in the form of discounts. 
We offer a monthly membership program with four premium priced tiers and a membership loyalty program, which entitles certain members to earn points that may be redeemed for park-related rewards. Membership and season pass sales establish an attendance base in advance of the season, reducing exposure to inclement weather and providing other benefits. In general, a season pass holder or member contributes higher aggregate revenue and profitability to the Company over the course of a year compared to a single day ticket guest because a season pass holder or member pays a higher ticket price and contributes to in-park guest spending over multiple visits. Additionally, guests enrolled in our membership program and season pass holders often bring paying guests and generate "word-of-mouth" advertising for the parks. Season pass and membership attendance constituted approximately 56% of the total attendance at our parks in 2020 and 63% of the total attendance at our parks in both 2019 and 2018. 
Our season pass holders and members are among our most valuable customers. To incentivize members to maintain their patronage and loyalty during the pandemic, we offered one bonus month for each month that they paid while their home park was closed. Members that continued to make their monthly membership payments also received a free upgrade to the next tier of membership valid until the end of 2022. In recognition of the unique challenges many of our guests faced due to the pandemic, we offered all of them the opportunity to pause their memberships (and payments) until their home park opens in 2021. All 2020 season pass holders received a free extension of their pass until the end of the 2021 season, along with a variety of in-park benefits to recognize their loyalty and continued commitment to the Company.
Our Group Sales team offers discounted tickets and catered meals for specific dates and tickets to large groups such as businesses, schools, and religious, fraternal and similar organizations.
We use promotional programs as a means of targeting specific market segments and locations not generally reached through group or retail sales efforts. The promotional programs utilize coupons, sweepstakes, reward incentives and rebates to attract additional visitors. These programs are implemented through online promotions, digital and social marketing activities, search engine marketing, radio and television advertising, direct mail, and sponsorship marketing. The special promotional offers are usually available for a limited time and offer a reduced admission price or provide some additional incentive to purchase a ticket.

Licenses
We have the exclusive right on a long-term basis to theme park usage of the Warner Bros. and DC Comics animated characters throughout the U.S. (except for the Las Vegas metropolitan area), Canada, Mexico and certain other countries. In particular, our license agreements entitle us to use, subject to customary approval rights of Warner Bros. and, in limited circumstances, approval rights of certain third parties, all animated, cartoon and comic book characters that Warner Bros. and DC Comics have the right to license, including Batman, The Joker, Superman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, Green Lantern, Harley Quinn, Aquaman, Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Tweety Bird and Yosemite Sam. They also include the right to sell merchandise using the characters. In addition to annual license fees, we are required to pay a royalty fee on any merchandise manufactured by or for us and sold that use the licensed characters. Warner Bros. has the right to terminate the license agreements under certain circumstances, including if any persons involved in the movie or television industries obtain control of us or, in the case of Warner Bros., upon a default under the Subordinated Indemnity Agreement.
Park Operations
We currently operate in geographically diverse markets in North America. Each park is managed by a park president who is responsible for all operations and management of the individual park. Each park president directs a full-time, on-site management team. Local advertising, ticket sales, community relations and hiring and training of personnel are the responsibility of individual park management in coordination with corporate support teams.
Each park management team includes senior personnel responsible for operations and maintenance; in-park food, beverage, merchandising and games; marketing and sales; human resources and finance. Park management compensation structures are designed to provide financial incentives for individual park managers to execute our strategy and to maximize revenue and free cash flow.
Our parks are generally open daily from Memorial Day through Labor Day. In addition, most of our parks are open weekends prior to and following their daily seasons, often in conjunction with themed events such as Fright Fest® and Holiday in the Park®. Due to their location, certain parks have longer operating seasons. Six Flags Magic Mountain operates year-round, and our parks in Mexico, Six Flags Fiesta Texas and Six Flags Over Texas operate weekends year-round outside of their traditional operating season. Typically, the parks charge a basic daily admission price that allows unlimited use of all rides and attractions, although in certain cases special rides and attractions require the payment of an additional fee. 
We suspended operations of our parks beginning on March 13, 2020, due to the spread of COVID-19 and local government mandates, which had a significant negative impact on the Company’s financial performance. We resumed partial operations at many of our parks on a staggered basis near the end of the second quarter using a cautious and phased approach, including limiting attendance, in accordance with local conditions and government guidelines. Attendance trends in 2020 continued to improve throughout the year, increasing from 35% of prior year levels in the third quarter to 51% in the fourth quarter, for the parks that were open. Several of our parks modified their operations by providing drive-through or walk-through experiences for the holiday season, and our parks in Mexico were able to operate for a portion of the fourth quarter. As a result, all of the Company’s theme parks and some of its water parks operated in at least some capacity for a portion of the season, albeit pursuant to reduced capacity and other operating limitations. Comparisons of open parks to prior year in the third quarter exclude attendance from Six Flags Discovery Kingdom and Six Flags Great America, as these parks had modified operations with minimal attendance in the third quarter of 2020.
See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for information concerning revenues and long-lived assets by domestic and international categories.

Capital Improvements and Other Initiatives
We regularly make capital investments for new rides and attractions in our parks. We purchase both new and used rides and attractions. On occasion, we also relocate rides among parks to provide fresh attractions. In addition, each year we make capital investments in the food, retail, games and other in-park areas to increase guest spending per capita. We also make annual enhancements to theming and landscaping of our parks in order to provide a more complete family-oriented entertainment experience, and invest in our information technology infrastructure to attain operational efficiencies. We regularly perform maintenance capital enhancements, with most expenditures made during the off-season. Repairs and maintenance costs for materials and services associated with maintaining assets, such as painting and inspecting existing rides, are expensed as incurred and are not included in capital expenditures.
In response to curtailed operations, and to preserve our liquidity position and prepare for multiple contingencies, we took actions to reduce operating expenses and defer or eliminate certain discretionary capital projects planned for 2020 and 2021. We deferred or eliminated $50 to $60 million of our discretionary capital improvement projects planned for 2020. We are currently planning to complete the installation of many of the rides and attractions planned for 2020 during the 2021 season, but will remain flexible regarding the completion of these projects. 
We believe the selective introduction of new rides and attractions, including family entertainment attractions, together with making general investments in the appearance and infrastructure of our parks, are important factors in promoting each of the parks to draw higher attendance and encourage longer visits, which can lead to higher in-park sales. We opened one of the world’s tallest pendulum rides at Six Flags Mexico (Mexico City, Mexico) during 2020. All other previously announced rides and attractions had openings deferred until 2021 or later.
Planned initiatives for 2021 include (i) the tallest, fastest and longest single rail coaster at Six Flags Great Adventure (Jackson, NJ); (ii) a record breaking water coaster at Six Flags Hurricane Harbor Gurnee (Gurnee, IL); (iii) a pendulum ride at Six Flags America (Largo, MD); (iv) a high-flying 360-degree rotating ride that stands 16 stories high at The Great Escape (Queensbury, NY); (v) a new seven-story spinning ride at Six Flags New England (Agawam, MA); (vi) the Midwest’s first tailspin waterslide at Six Flags Hurricane Harbor Rockford (Rockford, IL); (vii) a new 12,000 square-foot activity pool at Six Flags Hurricane Harbor Phoenix (Glendale, AZ); (viii) a four-story slide complex featuring three new waterslides at Six Flags Hurricane Harbor Arlington (Arlington, TX); (ix) a six-story waterslide complex at Six Flags Hurricane Harbor Splashtown (Houston, TX); (x) the tallest ride-of-its-kind aerial flying machine ride at Six Flags Fiesta Texas, (San Antonio, TX); (xi) rebranding Magic Waters and White Water Bay to Six Flags Hurricane Harbor Rockford and Six Flags Hurricane Harbor Oklahoma City, respectively; and (xii) the new Six Flags Hurricane Oklahoma City will also debut a high speed multi-lane racing water complex.
During 2021, we also plan to continue (i) our targeted marketing strategies to attract guests, including focusing on our breadth of product and value offerings; (ii) improving and expanding upon our branded product offerings and guest-focused initiatives to continue driving guest spending growth, including membership and our associated loyalty reward programs, and the all season dining pass program, which enables season pass holders and members to eat meals and snacks any day they visit the park for one upfront payment; (iii) focusing efforts to increase single-day attendance visitation including targeted discount strategies; and (iv) growing sponsorship revenue opportunities.
International Agreements
We have signed agreements to assist third parties in the development and management of Six Flags-branded parks outside of our core markets. As compensation for exclusivity, brand licensing rights, and design, development and management services, we receive fees during the design and development period as well as ongoing remuneration after the parks open to the public. The agreements do not require us to make any capital investments in the parks.
We currently have agreements to develop a Six Flags-branded park in Saudi Arabia. As previously reported, our partner in China had well publicized liquidity challenges and defaulted on its payment obligations to us. During 2020, we terminated our agreement with our partner in China to discontinue the development of Six Flags-branded parks in China.

We will be cautious about signing new international agreements outside of Saudi Arabia for the next several years as we focus our resources on strengthening our core business.
 Maintenance and Inspection
Rides are inspected at various levels and frequencies in accordance with manufacturer specifications. Our rides are inspected daily during the operating season by our maintenance personnel. These inspections include safety checks, as well as regular maintenance, and are made through both visual inspection and test operations of the rides. Our senior management and the individual park personnel evaluate the risk aspects of each park’s operations, potential risks to employees and staff as well as to the public. In addition, contingency response plans for potential emergency situations have been developed for each facility. During the off-season, maintenance personnel examine the rides and repair, refurbish and rebuild them when necessary. This process includes x-raying and magnafluxing (a further examination for minute cracks and defects) steel portions of certain rides at high-stress points. A large portion of our full-time workforce devotes substantially all of its time to maintaining the parks and our rides and attractions. We use a computerized maintenance-management system across all of our domestic parks to assist us in executing our maintenance programs. For parks that have remained closed since we suspended operations in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have continued our off-season maintenance program in order to ensure the parks’ safety and operational readiness for when they are cleared to open by state and local governments.
​
In addition to the performance of our internal maintenance and inspection procedures, third-party consultants are retained by us or our insurance carriers to perform an annual inspection of each park and all attractions. The results of these inspections are reported in written evaluation and inspection reports and include suggestions on various aspects of park operations. In certain states, state inspectors conduct additional annual ride inspections before the beginning of each season. Other portions of each park are subject to inspections by local fire marshals and health and building department officials. Furthermore, we use Ellis & Associates as water safety consultants at all of our waterparks to train lifeguards and audit safety procedures.
Insurance
We maintain insurance of the types and in amounts we believe are commercially reasonable and are available to businesses in our industry. We maintain multi-layered general liability policies that provide for excess liability coverage of up to $100.0 million per occurrence. For incidents arising on or after December 31, 2008, our self-insured retention is $2.0 million, followed by a $0.5 million deductible per occurrence applicable to all claims in the policy year for our domestic parks and our park in Canada and a nominal amount per occurrence for our parks in Mexico. Defense costs are in addition to these retentions. Our general liability policies cover the cost of punitive damages only in certain jurisdictions. Based upon reported claims and an estimate for incurred, but not reported claims, we accrue a liability for our retention contingencies. For workers’ compensation claims arising after November 15, 2003, our deductible is $0.75 million. We also maintain fire and extended coverage, business interruption, terrorism and other forms of insurance typical to businesses in this industry. The all peril property coverage policies insure our real and personal properties (other than land) against physical damage resulting from a variety of hazards. Additionally, we maintain information security and privacy liability insurance in the amount of $10.0 million with a $0.25 million retention per event.
We generally renegotiate our insurance policies on an annual basis. The majority of our current insurance policies expire on December 31, 2021. We cannot predict the level of the premiums that we may be required to pay for subsequent insurance coverage, the level of any retention applicable thereto, the level of aggregate coverage available or the availability of coverage for specific risks.

Competition
Our parks compete directly with other theme parks, waterparks and amusement parks and indirectly with other types of recreational facilities and forms of out of home entertainment within their market areas, including movies, sporting events, home entertainment options, restaurants and vacation travel. Principal direct competitors of our parks include SeaWorld Entertainment, Inc. and Cedar Fair, L.P. In addition, our business is subject to various factors affecting the recreation and leisure time industries generally, such as general economic conditions and changes in discretionary consumer spending habits. See "Item 1A. Risk Factors." Within each park’s regional market area, the principal factors affecting direct theme park competition include location, price, the uniqueness and perceived safety and quality of the rides and attractions in the park, the atmosphere and cleanliness of the park, the quality of park food and entertainment, and ease of travel to the park. Our theme parks have several advantages over other forms of entertainment. We believe that our parks offer a sufficient quality and variety of rides and attractions, culinary offerings, retail locations, and interactive and family experiences to make them highly competitive with other parks and forms of entertainment. They are outdoor venues spread over hundreds of acres, making them naturally conducive to social distancing. They are open many hours throughout the day, reducing the need for guests to arrive or leave at the same time. Finally, the vast majority of our guests live within a day’s drive, so a visit to one of our parks does not require air travel or a stay at a hotel. However, the COVID-19 pandemic could have longer-term impacts on consumer tastes and preferences and could shift consumer entertainment and recreation behaviors toward digital entertainment experiences and other off-premises experiences and technologies.
Seasonality
Our operations are highly seasonal, with approximately 75% of park attendance and revenues in a typical year occurring in the second and third calendar quarters of each year, with the most significant period falling between Memorial Day and Labor Day.
Environmental and Other Regulations
Our operations are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations including laws and regulations governing water and sewer discharges, air emissions, soil and groundwater contamination, the maintenance of underground and aboveground storage tanks and the disposal of waste and hazardous materials. In addition, our operations are subject to other local, state and federal governmental regulations including, without limitation, labor, health, safety, zoning and land use and minimum wage regulations applicable to theme park and waterpark operations, and local and state regulations applicable to restaurant operations at each park. Finally, certain of our facilities are subject to laws and regulations relating to the care of animals. We believe that we are in compliance with applicable environmental and other laws and regulations and, although no assurance can be given, we do not foresee the need for any significant expenditures in this area in the near future.
Portions of the undeveloped areas at certain of our parks are classified as wetlands. Accordingly, we may need to obtain governmental permits and other approvals prior to conducting development activities that affect these areas and future development may be prohibited in some or all of these areas. Additionally, the presence of wetlands in portions of our undeveloped land could adversely affect our ability to dispose of such land and/or the price we receive in any such disposition.
Human Capital
Employees
As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 1,950 full-time employees, and over the course of the 2020 operating season we employed approximately 29,000 seasonal employees. In this regard, we compete with other local employers for qualified students and other candidates on a season-by-season basis. As part of the seasonal employment program, we employ a significant number of teenagers, which subjects us to child labor laws.

10



Approximately 12% of our full-time and approximately 11% of our seasonal employees are subject to labor agreements with local chapters of national unions. These labor agreements expire in January, May and December 2021 (Six Flags Great Adventure), December 2021 (Six Flags Magic Mountain), January 2024 (Six Flags Over Texas), December 2024 (Six Flags Over Georgia) and January 2025 (Six Flags St. Louis). The labor agreements for La Ronde expire in various years ranging from December 2021 through December 2024. We consider our employee relations to be good.
Diversity and Inclusion
We are committed to creating an inclusive environment that fully embraces the diversity of our employees and guests, regardless of ethnicity, gender, age, disability, cultural background, sexual orientation, or religious beliefs. In that regard, we are focused on the following:

Listen | to team members and other stakeholders about how we can become more diverse and inclusive through our Diversity and Inclusion Council, and through regular team member surveys, which provide feedback directly to senior management, including the CEO
Train | leaders on how to embrace inclusion, creating awareness, understanding and recognizing explicit and implicit bias including by providing instruction on how to lead open and honest conversations with team members 
Address Unconscious Biases | by updating our grooming, social media, and hiring policies, and changing any ride or attraction names that could be viewed as offensive 
Build a Diverse Team | with a leadership team that represents the diversity of our marketplace and through updating recruiting, people planning, and talent management programs to foster more objective processes for all team members 
Partner with Communities | by proactively working with minority suppliers to develop long-term alliances 

​
Employee Development
​
We seek to continuously elevate employee development and training through a variety of different programs, opportunities, and resources. In 2020, we launched a partnership with the International Board of Credentialing and Continuing Education Standards to provide our guest-facing team members with specialized training to earn a Certificate in Autism Competency to further our commitment to better serve the special needs community, provide a more inclusive environment in our parks and continue our efforts in educating our team members on diversity and inclusion. In 2021, we will enhance our talent development program by providing our employees with access to virtual classrooms and online courses on topics including general safety, Office 365, harassment, and discrimination. Also in 2021, we plan to augment our succession planning process by establishing programs to better support the development of our talent bench for roles in management, maintenance and operations. Our senior leadership team reviews our talent development program annually with a particular focus on our top 20% of high performing, high potential talent including a focus on diversity. We are committed to identifying and developing the talents of our future leaders.
​
Employee Engagement and Recruitment
We conduct ongoing employee satisfaction surveys that provide actionable feedback from employees to management. The survey responses are anonymous and measure employee satisfaction and solicit honest feedback. Management from both corporate and the parks meet routinely to review the survey results and develop action plans in response to the employee feedback.
​
We work diligently to attract the best talent from a diverse range of sources in order to meet the current and future demands of our business. We have established relationships with high schools, trade schools, universities, professional associations and industry partners to proactively attract new talent.

11



​
Our recruiting practices and candidate selection are among our most important activities. In a year with unprecedented business disruption, we prioritized filling open positions with active team members to minimize layoffs and remained focus on retaining and recalling talent to select our most experienced people for park positions. In addition, we utilize social media, virtual job fairs and organizations across the United States to find diverse, enthusiastic and qualified employees. 
​
Competitive Benefits
​
Attracting, motivating, developing and retaining the best people is crucial to all aspects of our business and long-term success, and is central to our mission, vision and values. Our compensation programs are designed to align the compensation of our employees with our performance and to provide the proper incentives to attract, motivate and retain employees to achieve superior results. The structure of our compensation programs includes incentives based on both short-term and long-term performance. Specifically:
​

● | We provide employee wages that are competitive and consistent with employee positions, skill levels, experience, knowledge and geographic location.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We engage nationally recognized outside compensation and benefits consulting firms to independently evaluate the effectiveness of our executive compensation and benefit programs.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We align our executives’ long-term equity compensation with our stockholders’ interests by linking a significant portion of total compensation opportunity to business and individual performance. All full-time employees (other than participants in a collective bargaining agreement) have the opportunity to participate in our long-term equity incentive program.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | All full-time employees are eligible for health insurance, paid and unpaid leaves, and life and disability/accident coverage. We also offer a variety of voluntary benefits that allow employees to select the options that meet their needs, including telemedicine, paid parental leave, prescription savings solutions, an educational assistance program, health savings accounts, flexible spending accounts, legal insurance, identity theft insurance, pet insurance and a wellness program.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A unique Six Flags perquisite offers full-time employees a Diamond Elite membership, our highest membership tier of benefits that includes free admission to any of our parks and discounts on in-park products. Full-time employees are also provided complimentary tickets.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Safety
The health and safety of our employees is our highest priority. It is the shared responsibility of every employee to actively participate in creating a safe and secure environment and to minimize injuries. The hallmarks of the Company’s safety and security programs are:
​

● | Resources and education to ensure safe and secure operating environments at the parks, including compliance with Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) standards, as well as to improve overall workplace safety and health. This includes regular and ongoing safety training and assessments as well as annual safety audits.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | A highly trained workforce that proactively assesses risks, strives to eliminate unsafe conditions, and integrates learning from incidents to prevent future occurrences.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | Dedicated leadership, accountability, and employee empowerment.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------

​
During 2020, we acted quickly to implement extensive measures to proactively mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and provide a safe working environment for our employees. We consulted with an epidemiologist and a viral expert, and 

12



relied on recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other governmental agencies to develop core strategies to enhance the safety of our employees and guests. To support these strategies we: 

● | implemented daily health screenings of employees,
--+--------------------------------------------------


● | distributed a personal protective equipment pack to all employees,
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


● | significantly enhanced sanitization measures,
--+----------------------------------------------


● | enforced social distance requirements,
--+---------------------------------------


● | added training to ensure compliance with the additional health and safety protocols,
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | implemented procedures to address actual and suspected COVID-19 cases and potential exposure,
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | required masks to be worn in all locations (with limited exceptions pursuant to applicable law), and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | rolled out contactless recruiting and hiring to reduce potential COVID-19 exposure.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We received favorable responses from our employees as evidenced by our team member voice survey scores. In addition, we offered guests the ability to obtain cash cards from kiosks throughout the parks to facilitate electronic transactions as an option in lieu of using cash, and implemented mobile food ordering at all of our domestic parks during 2020. These innovations added contactless means to enhance our guests’ experience through faster, more convenient transactions while elevating our enhanced safety guidelines.
