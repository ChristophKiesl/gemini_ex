ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
Unisys Corporation, a Delaware corporation (Unisys, we, our, or the company), is a global information technology (IT) services company that delivers successful outcomes for the most demanding businesses and governments. Unisys offerings include digital workplace services; cloud and infrastructure services; and software operating environments for high-intensity enterprise computing. Unisys integrates security into all of its solutions.
As of December 31, 2020, we operated in two business segments – Services and Technology. In January 2021, the company decided to make a number of changes to its organizational structure to more effectively address evolving client needs. With these changes, the company revised its reportable segments, but this did not impact the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2020. The company’s reportable segments will be as follows: Digital Workplace Services, which will provide services and IP-led solutions that support clients’ employees’ productivity, satisfaction and ability to securely work anywhere, any time; Cloud & Infrastructure, which will provide hybrid and multi-cloud solutions in select markets to accelerate innovation and increase efficiency of our clients’ businesses; ClearPath Forward®, which will provide server systems and operating system software and services that are secure, innovative, and reliable for mission-critical processing; and Other, which is principally comprised of business processing outsourcing (BPO) solutions, which will provide management of critical processes and functions for clients in select industries, helping them improve performance and reduce costs. These changes will be reflected prospectively, with comparable prior period data, in the company’s first quarter 2021 Form 10-Q.
Principal Products and Services
We deliver high-performance, security-centric, leveraged services and solutions across industries, industry-specific application solutions and technology solutions worldwide to our primary target markets: Government (national governments, other than directly to the U.S. federal government, and state and local governments globally), Commercial (e.g., travel and transportation and life sciences and healthcare) and Financial Services (e.g., commercial and retail banking). 
We market our products and services solutions primarily through a direct sales force. Complementing our direct sales force, we make use of a select group of resellers and alliance partners to market our services and product portfolio. In certain countries, we market primarily through distributors.
Our solutions are designed to deliver successful outcomes for our clients, enabling them to:
•Transform core business processes to compete more effectively in their markets; 
•Improve user engagement for customers and workers, streamline operations and enhance go-to-market efforts;
•Optimize IT infrastructure to meet digital-business requirements, including secure access anywhere and any time;
•Simplify management of IT infrastructure and service delivery; and
•Enhance enterprise security.
Within Services, our principal solutions include cloud and infrastructure services, application services and business process outsourcing services, each of which is delivered with advanced security built in.
•In cloud and infrastructure services, we help clients apply cloud and as-a-service delivery models to capitalize on business opportunities, make their end users more productive and manage and secure their IT infrastructure and operations more economically. 
•In application services, we help clients transform their business processes by developing and managing new leading-edge applications for select industries, offering advanced data analytics and modernizing existing enterprise applications.
•In business process outsourcing solutions, we assume management of critical processes and functions for clients in target industries, helping them improve performance and reduce costs. 
We deliver some of these capabilities through our leveraged Services solutions, which include:
•Unisys InteliServeTM, a service solution that transforms traditional service desk into an intelligent, user-centric experience aligned with the needs of the modern digital workplace. The service leverages the InteliServe platform, an integrated suite of technologies for omnichannel support, advanced analytics, automation, artificial intelligence, machine learning and identity authentication.
•Unisys CloudForte®, a comprehensive managed service offering to help accelerate the secure move of data and applications to the cloud. The solution is available for Microsoft Azure, AWS, and hybrid cloud environments and includes the following features: an automated software-as-a-service platform to identify and provision private, public and hybrid cloud services, real-time analytics, and capabilities for industrial-grade modernization of legacy applications. 
•Unisys Security Solutions, a portfolio that includes managed security services, security consulting services, the Unisys Incident Response Ecosystem subscription service and the TrustCheck™ cyber risk management solution and services for the Unisys Stealth® solution, and that is underpinned by our Zero Trust security approach. 
In Technology, we offer a software operating environment and related applications for high-intensity enterprise computing, including the procurement of hardware and other related products to help clients improve security and flexibility, reduce costs and improve the efficiency of their data-center environments. As a pioneer in large-scale computing, we offer deep experience and rich technological capabilities in transaction-intensive, mission-critical operating environments. 
Our Technology products include: 
•Unisys ClearPath Forward®, a secure, scalable software operating environment for high-intensity enterprise computing capable of delivering Unisys security across multiple platforms. The ClearPath Forward operating environment is hardware-independent and provides a tested, integrated stack of software products that run on a range of contemporary, commonly-deployed Intel x86 server platforms and select virtualization environments of the client’s choice. Thus, ClearPath Forward provides clients with the flexibility to choose to deploy either as an integrated system, as a private cloud via software services or in a public cloud, starting with Microsoft Azure.
•Unisys Stealth security software, which enables trusted identities to access micro-segmented critical assets and safely communicate through secure, encrypted channels. Stealth™ establishes user authentication, prevents lateral attacker movement and reduces data center, mobile and cloud attack surfaces and quickly isolates devices or users at the first sign of compromise. Stealth also reduces the cost and complexity of securing information and operation technology such as industrial control systems, allowing organizations to meet compliance and security mandates.
Our industry solutions help law enforcement agencies solve crime; social services case workers assist families; travel and transportation companies manage freight and distribution; and financial institutions deliver omnichannel banking.
On March 13, 2020, we completed the sale of our U.S. Federal business to Science Applications International Corporation for cash of $1.2 billion. Our financial statements have been retroactively reclassified to report the U.S. Federal business as discontinued operations. As a result, all items relating to the business within the consolidated statements of income (loss) have been reported as income from discontinued operations, net of tax, and all items relating to the business within the consolidated balance sheets have been reported as either assets or liabilities of discontinued operations. Depreciation, amortization, capital expenditures, and significant noncash operating and investing activities related to the U.S. Federal business were immaterial for all periods presented.
Materials
Unisys purchases components and supplies from a number of suppliers around the world. For certain Technology products, we rely on a single or limited number of suppliers, although we make every effort to assure that alternative sources are available if the need arises. The failure of our suppliers to deliver components and supplies in sufficient quantities and in a timely manner could adversely affect our business. For more information on the risks associated with purchasing components and supplies, see “Risk Factors” (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K). 
Patents, Trademarks and Licenses
As of January 31, 2021, Unisys owns over 510 active U.S. patents and over 50 active patents granted in eleven non-U.S. jurisdictions. These patents cover systems and methods related to a wide variety of technologies, including, but not limited to, information security, cloud computing, virtualization, database encryption/management and user interfaces. We have granted licenses covering both single patents, and particular groups of patents, to others. Likewise, we have active licensing agreements granting us rights under patents owned by other entities. However, our business is not materially dependent upon any single patent, patent license, or related group thereof.
Unisys also maintains 24 U.S. trademark and service mark registrations, and over 500 additional trademark and service mark registrations in eighty non-U.S. jurisdictions as of January 31, 2021. These marks are valuable assets used on or in connection with our services and products, and as such are actively monitored, policed and protected by Unisys and its agents.
Seasonality
Our revenue is affected by such factors as the introduction of new services and products, the length of sales cycles and the seasonality of purchases. Seasonality generally has not resulted in material quarterly revenue changes. 
Customers
No single client accounted for more than 10% of our revenue in the year ended December 31, 2020. 
Backlog
In the Services segment, firm order backlog at December 31, 2020 was $3.4 billion, compared to $4.3 billion at December 31, 2019. Approximately $1.3 billion (39%) of 2020 backlog is expected to be converted to revenue in 2021. Although we believe that this backlog is firm, we may, for commercial reasons, allow the orders to be cancelled, with or without penalty. 
Because of the relatively short cycle between order and shipment in our Technology segment, we believe that backlog information for this segment is not material to the understanding of our business.
Competition
Our business is affected by rapid change in technology in the information services and technology industries and aggressive competition from many domestic and foreign companies. Principal competitors are systems integrators, consulting and other professional services firms, outsourcing providers, infrastructure services providers, computer hardware manufacturers and software providers. We compete primarily on the basis of service, product performance, technological innovation, and price. We believe that our continued focused investment in engineering and research and development, coupled with our sales and marketing capabilities, will have a favorable impact on our competitive position. For more information on the competitive risks we face, see “Risk Factors” (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K).
Environmental Matters
Our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position have not been materially affected by compliance with federal, state and local laws regulating the protection of the environment. Capital expenditures for environmental control facilities are not expected to be material in 2021 and 2022.
Employees
At December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 17,200 employees serving clients around the world.
