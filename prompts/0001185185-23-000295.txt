ITEM 1. BUSINESS



General Background of the Company



First Capital International, Inc., formerly Ranger/USA, Inc., incorporated as a Delaware corporation on April 21, 1994 and assumed its current name in August 1998 when new management took over the Company. At the time new management assumed control, the Company had no existing operations, and began implementation of a new business plan. Beginning in 1998, the Company’s original focus was the identification, acquisition and operation of businesses serving or focused on Central and Eastern European markets. From 2001 to 2013, the Company focused its operations on the development of its “smart house” technology and markets for the Company’s home command center under its subsidiary VIP Systems, Inc. VIP Systems, Inc. ceased to be a subsidiary of the Company in 2015. The Company was engaged in the design, production and sale of security system for homeland security applications as well as home automation and video surveillance systems, including highly sophisticated marine video surveillance applications. From there, the Company became a holding company with no existing business operations.



Our principal executive offices are located at 5829 W Sam Houston Pkwy N, Suite 405, Houston, Texas 77041.



Previously, our common stock was registered with the SEC under Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). After the period ended March 31, 2010, however, we did not file any periodic reports with the SEC, and accordingly failed to comply with Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder. On October 27, 2014, the SEC accepted our offer of settlement whereby we consented to the entry of an order making findings and removing registration of securities pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Exchange Act, and accordingly, the registration of our common stock was revoked.



On October 28, 2021, we filed a new registration statement on Form 10 with the SEC to register our common stock under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act. This registration statement, as amended, became effective on December 27, 2021.



The Company is a shell company with no existing business operations and is currently considering different business activities.



Business Objectives of the Company



Since January 1, 2015, management believes that the Company has had no business operations. Management has determined to direct its efforts and limited resources to pursue potential new business opportunities. The Company does not intend to limit itself to a particular industry and has not established any particular criteria upon which it will consider a business opportunity.



Our common stock is presently not quoted or traded on any securities exchange or on an electronic inter-dealer quotation system. There is currently no trading market in our shares nor do we believe that any active trading market has existed for approximately the last 10 years. There can be no assurance that there will be an active trading market for our securities in the future. In the event that an active trading market commences, there can be no assurance as to the market price of our shares of common stock, whether any trading market will provide liquidity to investors, or whether any trading market will be sustained.



Our management will have substantial flexibility in identifying and selecting a prospective new business opportunity. We are dependent on the judgment of our management in connection with this process. In evaluating a prospective business opportunity, we would consider, among other factors, the following:




● | costs associated with pursuing a new business opportunity; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | growth potential of the new business opportunity; 
● | experiences, skills and availability of additional personnel necessary to pursue a potential new business opportunity;
● | necessary capital requirements; 
● | the competitive position of the new business opportunity; 
● | stage of business development; 
● | the market acceptance of the potential products and services; 




 5

 




● | proprietary features and degree of intellectual property; and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the regulatory environment that may be applicable to any prospective business opportunity.




The foregoing criteria are not intended to be exhaustive and there may be other criteria that management may deem relevant. In connection with an evaluation of a prospective or potential business opportunity, management may be expected to conduct a due diligence review.



The time and costs required to pursue new business opportunities, which includes negotiating and documenting relevant agreements and preparing requisite documents for filing pursuant to applicable securities laws, cannot be ascertained with any degree of certainty.



Management intends to devote such time as it deems necessary to carry out the Company’s affairs. The exact length of time required for the pursuit of any new potential business opportunities is uncertain. No assurance can be made that we will be successful in our efforts. We cannot project the amount of time that our management will devote to the Company’s plan of operation.



The Company intends to conduct its activities in a way that avoids being classified as an “investment company” under the Investment Company Act of 1940, and therefore avoid application of the costly and restrictive registration and other provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the regulations promulgated thereunder.



Company is a Blank Check Company and a Shell Company



At present, the Company is a development stage company with no revenues, no assets and no specific business plan or purpose. The Company’s business plan is to seek new business opportunities or to engage in a merger or acquisition with an unidentified company. As a result, the Company is a “blank check company” and, as a result, any offerings of the Company’s securities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) must comply with Rule 419 promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) under the Act.



We are a “shell company,” as defined in Rule 405 promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act. A shell company is one that has no or nominal operations and either: (i) no or nominal assets; or (ii) assets consisting primarily of cash or cash equivalents. As a shell company, we are subject to various laws, regulations and restrictions, including that we will be subject to restrictions on our use of Form S-8 to register stock that we may issue to our employees and consultants, and you will be subject to restrictions from relying on Rule 144 for the resale of your common stock, as described below.



Prohibition on use of Form S-8



Shell companies are prohibited from using Form S-8 to register securities under the Securities Act. If a company ceases to be a shell company, it may use Form S-8 60 calendar days after it has filed all reports and other materials required to be filed under the Exchange Act during the preceding 12 months or for such shorter period that it has been required to file such reports and materials after the company files “Form 10 information,” which is information that a company would be required to file in a registration statement on Form 10 if it were registering a class of securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. This information would normally be reported on a current report on Form 8-K reporting the completion of a transaction that caused the company to cease being a shell company.



Unavailability of Rule 144 for Resale



Rule 144 under the Act provides an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and allows the holders of restricted securities to sell their securities utilizing one of the provisions of this rule. However, Rule 144 specifically precludes reliance by holders of securities of shell companies such as ours or any issuer that has been at any time previously a shell company, except if the following conditions are met:




● | The issuer of the securities that was formerly a shell company has ceased to be a shell company;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The issuer of the securities is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The issuer of the securities has filed all Exchange Act reports and material required to be filed, as applicable, during the preceding 12 months (or such shorter period that the issuer was required to file such reports and materials), other than current reports on Form 8-K; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | At least one year has elapsed from the time that the issuer filed current comprehensive disclosure with the SEC reflecting its status as an entity that is not a shell company.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As a result of our classification as a shell company, our investors are not permitted to rely on the “safe harbor” provisions of Rule 144, promulgated pursuant to the Securities Act, so as not to be considered underwriters in connection with the sale of our securities until one year from the date that we cease to be a shell company. This will likely make it more difficult for us to attract additional capital through subsequent unregistered offerings because purchasers of securities in such unregistered offerings will not be able to resell their securities in reliance on Rule 144, a safe harbor on which holders of restricted securities usually rely to resell securities.



No Market for our Common Stock



Our common stock is presently not quoted on any securities exchange or on an electronic inter-dealer quotation system. There is currently no trading market in our shares. We anticipate at some point in the future for a market maker to apply with FINRA for the right to quote our common stock and make a market for our common stock on the over-the-counter market. There can be no assurances, however, that any market maker will make such an application or that such application, if made, will be approved by FINRA.



We will be deemed a blank check company under Rule 419 of the Securities Act



The provisions of Rule 419 apply to registration statements filed under the Securities Act by a blank check company, such as the Company. Rule 419 requires that a blank check company filing a registration statement deposit the securities being offered and proceeds of the offering into an escrow or trust account pending the execution of an agreement for an acquisition or merger. While we are not currently registering shares for an offering, we may do so in the future.



In addition, an issuer is required to file a post-effective amendment to a registration statement upon the execution of an agreement for an acquisition or merger. The rule provides procedures for the release of the offering funds, if any, in conjunction with the post-effective acquisition or merger. The obligations to file post-effective amendments are in addition to the obligations to file Forms 8-K to report for both the entry into a material definitive (non-ordinary course of business) agreement and the completion of the transaction. Rule 419 applies to both primary and re-sale or secondary offerings.



Within five days of filing a post-effective amendment setting forth the proposed terms of an acquisition, the Company must notify each investor whose shares are in escrow, if any. Each such investor then has no fewer than 20 and no greater than 45 business days to notify the Company in writing if they elect to remain an investor. A failure to reply indicates that the person has elected to not remain an investor. As all investors are allotted this second opportunity to determine to remain an investor, acquisition agreements should be conditioned upon enough funds remaining in escrow to close the transaction.



Effecting a business combination



Prospective investors in our common stock will not have an opportunity to evaluate the specific merits or risks of any of the one or more business combinations that we may undertake. A business combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which needs to raise substantial additional capital by means of being a publicly trading company, while avoiding what it may deem to be adverse consequences of undertaking a public offering itself. These include time delays, significant expense, loss of voting control and compliance with various federal and state securities laws. A business combination may involve a company which may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth.



The Company has not identified a target business or target industry



The Company’s effort in identifying a prospective target business will not be limited to a particular industry and the Company may ultimately acquire a business in any industry that management deems appropriate. To date, the Company has not selected any target business on which to concentrate our search for a business combination. While the Company intends to focus on target businesses in the United States, it is not limited to United States entities and may consummate a business combination with a target business outside of the United States. Accordingly, there is no basis for investors in the Company’s common stock to evaluate the possible merits or risks of the target business or the particular industry in which we may ultimately operate. To the extent we effect a business combination with a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stage of development or growth, including entities without established records of sales or earnings; we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies. In addition, to the extent that we effect a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk, we may be affected by the currently unascertainable risks of that industry. An extremely high level of risk frequently characterizes many industries which experience rapid growth. In addition, although the Company’s management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular industry or target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.

Sources of target businesses



Our management anticipates that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including securities broker-dealers, investment bankers, venture capitalists, bankers and other members of the financial community, who may present solicited or unsolicited proposals. Our management may also bring to our attention target business candidates. While we do not presently anticipate engaging the services of professional firms that specialize in business acquisitions on any formal basis, we may engage these firms in the future, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee or other compensation in connection with a business combination. In no event, however, will we pay management any finder’s fee or other compensation for services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the consummation of a business combination.



Selection of a target business and structuring of a business combination



Management currently owns approximately 93% of our issued and outstanding common stock and will have broad discretion in identifying and selecting a prospective target business, due to this large percentage ownership. In evaluating a prospective target business, our management will consider, among other factors, the following:




● | financial condition and results of operation of the target company; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | growth potential; 
● | experience and skill of management and availability of additional personnel; 
● | capital requirements; 
● | competitive position; 
● | stage of development of the products, processes or services; 
● | degree of current or potential market acceptance of the products, processes or services; 
● | proprietary features and degree of intellectual property or other protection of the products, processes or services;
● | regulatory environment of the industry; and 
● | costs associated with effecting the business combination. 




These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular business combination will be based, to the extent relevant, on the above factors as well as other considerations deemed relevant by our management in effecting a business combination consistent with our business objective. In evaluating a prospective target business, we will conduct a due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and inspection of facilities, as well as review of financial and other information which will be made available to us.



We will endeavor to structure a business combination so as to achieve the most favorable tax treatment to us, the target business and both companies’ stockholders. However, there can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service or applicable state tax authorities will necessarily agree with the tax treatment of any business combination we consummate.



The time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete the business combination cannot presently be ascertained with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which a business combination is not ultimately completed will result in a loss to us.



Probable lack of business diversification



While we may seek to effect business combinations with more than one target business, it is more probable that we will only have the ability to effect a single business combination, if at all. Accordingly, the prospects for our success may be entirely dependent upon the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities which may have the resources to complete several business combinations with entities operating in multiple industries or multiple areas of a single industry, it is probable that we will lack the resources to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses. By consummating a business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:




● | subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to a business combination, and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | result in our dependency upon the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limited ability to evaluate a target prospect’s management



We cannot assure you that our assessment of a target prospect’s management will prove to be correct. In addition, we cannot assure you that the future management will have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role, if any, of the members of our board of directors in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty.



While it is possible that some of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following a business combination, it is unlikely that such directors will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to a business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that our directors will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.



Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or those additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.



Our auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern



Our audited financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were prepared using the assumption that we will continue our operations as a going concern. Our independent accountants in their audit report have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our operations are dependent on our ability to raise sufficient capital or complete business combination as a result of which we become profitable. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. There is not enough cash on hand to fund our administrative expenses and operating expenses for the next 12 months. Therefore, we may be unable to continue operations in the future as a going concern. If we cannot continue as a viable entity, our stockholders may lose some or all of their investment in our common stock.



Competition



In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, we expect to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations, either directly or through affiliates. Many if not virtually most of these competitors possess far greater financial, human and other resources compared to our resources. While we believe that there are numerous potential target businesses that we may identify our ability to compete in acquiring certain of the more desirable target businesses will be limited by our limited financial and human resources. Our inherent competitive limitations are expected by management to give others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business that we may identify and seek to pursue. Further, any of these limitations may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. Our management believes, however, that our status as a reporting public entity with potential access to the United States public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over certain privately-held entities having a similar business objective in acquiring a desirable target business with growth potential on favorable terms.



If we succeed in executing a business combination, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from existing competitors of the business we acquire. In particular, certain industries which experience rapid growth frequently attract an increasingly larger number of competitors, including those with far greater financial, marketing, technical and other resources than the initial competitors in the industry in which we seek to operate. The degree of competition characterizing the industry of any prospective target business cannot presently be ascertained. We cannot assure you that, subsequent to a business combination, we will have the resources to compete effectively, especially to the extent that the target business is in a high-growth industry.



Conflicts of Interest



The Company’s management is not required to commit its full time to the Company’s affairs. As a result, pursuing new business opportunities may require a longer period of time than if management would devote full time to the Company’s affairs. Management is not precluded from serving as an officer or director of any other entity that is engaged in business activities similar to those of the Company. Management has not identified and is not currently negotiating a new business opportunity for us. In the future, management may become associated or affiliated with entities engaged in business activities similar to those we intend to conduct. In such event, management may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented. In the event that the Company’s management has multiple business affiliations, our management may have legal obligations to present certain business opportunities to multiple entities. In the event that a conflict of interest shall arise, management will consider factors such as reporting status, availability of audited financial statements, current capitalization and the laws of jurisdictions. If several business opportunities or operating entities approach management with respect to a business combination, management will consider the foregoing factors as well as the preferences of the management of the operating company. Management will act in what it believes will be in the best interests of the shareholders of the Company. The Company will not enter into a transaction with a target business that is affiliated with management.

Employees



We currently have one employee, Alex Genin, our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, who works for us part-time. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the consummation of a business combination. We expect to continue to use independent contractors, consultants, attorneys and accountants as necessary, to complement services rendered by our employees.
