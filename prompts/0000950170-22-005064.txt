Item 1. Business
Overview
 We are a biopharmaceutical company leveraging our innovative virus-like particle (VLP) platform technology to develop vaccines against infectious diseases, with an initial focus on life-threatening respiratory diseases. Our VLP platform technology is designed to enable multivalent, particle-based display of complex viral antigens, which we believe will induce broad, robust, and durable protection against the specific viruses targeted. Our pipeline includes vaccine candidates targeting some of the most prevalent viral causes of pneumonia. We are developing these candidates for older adults, a patient population with high unmet need. Our vaccine candidate IVX-A12 is a bivalent candidate, or a mixture of two different VLP candidates. IVX-A12 combines IVX-121, a vaccine candidate designed to target respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and IVX-241, a vaccine candidate designed to target human metapneumovirus (hMPV). There are currently no vaccines approved for either RSV or hMPV, which are two common causes of pneumonia in older adults. We initiated a clinical trial of IVX-121 in September 2021, with interim topline data expected in the second quarter of 2022. Contingent on favorable results from the IVX-121 clinical trial and completion of Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) manufacturing of IVX-241, we plan to submit an investigational new drug application (IND) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and, thereafter, initiate a clinical trial of our combination vaccine candidate, IVX-A12, in the second half of 2022.
We are developing additional vaccine candidates as part of our strategy to develop combination VLP vaccines targeting the viral causes of pneumonia in older adults. We are conducting a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of our coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) candidate IVX-411 in Australia and reported interim topline results for this clinical trial in March 2022. Overall, although an immune response was observed and the initial reactogenicity data were favorable, the level of immunogenicity response was below our expectations. We are conducting further analysis of the data and our IVX-411 vaccine candidate, including an investigation into the manufacture, shipment, and vaccine administration in the Phase 1/2 clinical trial. We will further evaluate our plans with respect to our current COVID-19 vaccine candidates based on the results of these efforts. We also have licensed the rights to develop and commercialize an influenza VLP vaccine from the University of Washington (UW) and have an emerging flu program.
Our Strategy
 Our goal is to utilize our VLP platform technology to develop vaccines against infectious diseases with an initial focus on life-threatening respiratory diseases and a vision of creating pan-respiratory vaccines for older adults. Key elements of our strategy include:
•Advancing our combination RSV-hMPV VLP vaccine candidate, IVX-A12, through clinical development and regulatory approval for the prevention of respiratory disease and pneumonia in older adults. We initiated a Phase 1/1b clinical trial in September 2021 to assess the safety and immunogenicity of IVX-121 against RSV in adults aged 18-45 and 60-75. We expect to report interim topline data from this trial in the second quarter of 2022. Contingent on favorable results, we plan to combine IVX-121 with our hMPV VLP vaccine candidate, IVX-241, to produce our bivalent vaccine candidate, IVX-A12, and to advance this combination vaccine candidate into clinical development. We have completed our pre-IND meeting for the IVX-A12 combination bivalent RSV and hMPV VLP vaccine candidate and expect to begin our Phase 1 trial for IVX-A12 in the second half of 2022. We believe that a bivalent RSV and hMPV targeted VLP vaccine has the potential to provide a more optimal approach to preventing these two common causes of pneumonia, neither of which currently has an approved vaccine.
•Leveraging our VLP platform technology to pursue additional vaccine candidates and combinations in indications with high unmet need. We believe our VLP vaccine technology has broad potential applicability beyond RSV and hMPV, including in SARS-CoV-2 and in influenza, and we have programs in both of these indications. We also plan to evaluate the development of VLP candidates for other indications with high unmet need, and to continue to evaluate the potential of our VLP platform technology in combination vaccines in support of our vision to ultimately create pan-respiratory vaccines.
•Building manufacturing scale-up capability early in the development process. For all our programs, we plan to identify and contract with large-scale commercial contract development and manufacturing organizations early in the development process. We plan to initiate scale-up of manufacturing process development activities immediately following commencement of clinical trials to enable incorporation of manufacturing process changes early in development. We believe that this will lower manufacturing risk for 
 

our programs as well as accelerate our timelines to regulatory approval and build the scale-up capability that is also needed for delivering on our vision of a pan-respiratory vaccine.
•Further optimizing our VLP platform technology. We intend to invest in process enhancements that we believe could enable a more rapid development of future vaccine candidates. As part of this plan, we intend to evaluate alternative manufacturing processes that we believe could reduce time from candidate selection to availability of clinical trial material, enable us to rapidly respond to annual strain changes as needed in our influenza program, and potentially make our VLP technology available as needed for future pandemics.
•Maximizing the value of our vaccine candidates through selective partnerships. As we continue to build and advance our vaccine candidate pipeline, we may explore on a candidate-by-candidate basis partnerships or strategic collaborations to accelerate development or commercialization in key regions with third parties who have complementary capabilities that allow us to enhance the value of our pipeline.
Our VLP Technology
 Our technology platform is based on the VLP approach to vaccine development, which we believe has been validated through the regulatory approvals and commercial success of third-party, naturally occurring VLP vaccines and has several benefits. These naturally occurring VLPs have shown the ability to induce high and sustained levels (titers) of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) in both older and younger adults, which have generally been associated with protective immunity. In addition, we believe VLPs can be used in combination vaccines as VLPs enable multivalent display of antigens in a manner that closely resembles viruses but contain no genetic material. However, VLPs engineered to display complex viral antigens have in general been difficult to develop or successfully manufacture at scale, limiting the pathogens that can be addressed by this approach.
 Our vaccine technology was licensed from the Institute for Protein Design at the University of Washington (UW IPD) and is designed to enable the application of VLP-based vaccines against a broader array of pathogens than has been possible with naturally occurring VLPs and to overcome the manufacturing challenges experienced with these VLPs as well as other VLP technologies. Our licensed VLP technology utilizes a two-component computationally designed protein structure that self-assembles without interfering with the structure of the displayed antigens. The individual protein components are expressed and purified using traditional recombinant protein techniques, which we believe will allow us to manufacture our VLP vaccine candidates more efficiently at scale.
Vaccines are designed to prevent disease by providing a safe exposure to key components of pathogens capable of inducing protective immunity. Infants and young children have typically not been exposed to many pathogens and have limited immunity following the disappearance of maternal antibodies. As infants grow into adults the immune system becomes stronger and more capable of fighting off several pathogens that cause disease, owing to both vaccines and natural exposure to infections as children. However, as adults age, their immune system becomes weaker and less capable of mounting an effective immune response. This phenomenon is called immunosenescence, and it leaves older adults more susceptible to disease than younger adults. Recently, several vaccines have been approved or recommended specifically for use in older adults and we believe that novel approaches to vaccine development will continue to drive the market for prevention of disease in this population.
 



Our initial focus is on the development of vaccines to prevent respiratory disease and pneumonia caused by viral pathogens in older adults. We believe there is a need for effective vaccines to combat infections in older adults, who are generally less able to mount an immune response against pathogens compared to other age groups due to immunosenescence. Immunosenescence causes older adults to be more susceptible to severe symptoms and death from infections and results in a weaker response to vaccination with conventional vaccines. For RSV, hMPV, and SARS-CoV-2 there is a strong correlation between nAb levels and increased protection against disease. For this reason, vaccines able to induce the highest and most durable nAb titers will likely be the most protective against infection, particularly in older adults. We believe that VLP vaccines may be effective in generating the high and durable nAb responses needed. In addition, we believe our platform has the potential to address the global need for thermostable, low-cost, and readily manufacturable vaccines.
 Benefit of Combination Vaccines
 We plan to utilize our innovative VLP platform technology to develop and deliver combination vaccine products, initially targeting respiratory pathogens in older adults. Combination vaccines have had commercial success in both pediatric and young adult populations with significant patient access and market penetration. This is because combination vaccines can be developed to protect against diverse pathogens or multiple strains or variants of the same pathogen with a single product while having the potential to reduce the number of injections and simplifying the immunization schedule.
We predict that as more vaccines targeting the older adult community are developed, combination vaccines will become the preferred approach for older adults, similar to what has occurred with pediatric and young adult vaccines. We believe an early focus on combination vaccine candidates against respiratory viruses in older adults will give us a competitive advantage over monovalent vaccine candidates in development, and our ultimate vision is to develop pan-respiratory vaccines.
 Potential Benefits of VLP Vaccines
 There are a number of highly effective vaccines on the market (e.g., for HPV and HBV) and vaccines in development (e.g., for norovirus) that are based on VLPs. In these instances, the vaccines contain proteins from the target pathogen that naturally self-assemble into VLPs and are capable of inducing a protective immune response. Data from third-party preclinical studies and clinical trials suggest that VLPs are capable of inducing a robust and durable immune response that in some cases was superior to soluble antigens.
The robust response to VLPs is due to their interaction with several aspects of both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system, which are responsible for driving immediate and lasting immune responses. The innate immune system involves a diverse set of cells, including dendritic cells, mast cells, eosinophils, basophils, neutrophils and macrophages, all of which generate a rapid response to pathogens or other foreign bodies. The adaptive immune system is a second line of defense that is specific to a pathogen or antigen and is triggered when antigen presenting cells (APCs) from the innate immune system activate and recruit cells from the adaptive immune system. The adaptive immune system is composed of T cells and B cells which can form immunologic memory and therefore be activated upon reintroduction of the initial antigen or pathogen.


As illustrated in the figure below, VLPs induce robust immune responses through (1) improved uptake and presentation of VLP-based antigens by APCs that “instruct” T cells on pathogenic threats, (2) efficient trafficking of VLPs to the lymph nodes, a critical site for adaptive immune responses, (3) enhanced cellular crosstalk between APCs, T cells and B cells and (4) the potential of multivalent, VLP-based antigens to effectively cross-link and stimulate antigen receptors on B cells, which mature into short-lived plasma cells, long-lived plasma cells and memory B cells following exposure to antigens. Compared to soluble antigens, the observed strength of B cell receptor cross-linking by multivalent, VLP-based vaccines are thought to increase the induction of long-lived plasma cells, which provide a durable antibody response. As an example, marketed HPV vaccines have demonstrated high levels of immunogenicity and efficacy for 9-10 years following vaccination while 80% people vaccinated with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) VLP vaccine showed protective titers at least 10 years after their primary immunization.
 

We believe there are several other potential advantages to VLP-based vaccines. VLPs are non-replicating and non-infectious, which we believe has the potential to make them safer to use in all populations. In addition, since they do not replicate, VLPs have the potential to stimulate immune responses even in the presence of pre-existing immunity (through previous infection or vaccination), which has limited the utility of some viral vector-based vaccine platforms. VLPs have also been observed to induce robust nAb levels in older adults, despite immunosenescence. VLPs have also been effective in the development of combination vaccines. For example, the Gardasil and Cervarix vaccines for use against HPV, among others, incorporate combinations of VLPs targeting different viral strains. For Gardasil, the initial formulation contained four VLPs, and serotype coverage was expanded through the inclusion of five additional HPV type VLPs in a second-generation product, showing the feasibility of expanding VLP formulations. Gardasil/Gardasil-9 generated $5.7 billion in 2021 worldwide sales. In addition, the Takeda/HilleVax norovirus VLP candidate, a combination of two VLPs targeting different norovirus genotypes, has successfully completed Phase 2 clinical trials. Evaluation of nAb titers induced by this vaccine candidate showed no difference between the response seen in adults aged 22-48 and adults aged 60 and over.
VLP-based vaccines have also induced cross-protective immune responses against related virus strains not included in the vaccine. This result was believed to be due to antibody responses against subdominant epitopes that only provoke an immune response when presented to the immune system in a multivalent form. Cross-protective immune responses have been seen in clinical and post-marketing surveillance data from approved HPV vaccines, Phase 2 data from the Takeda/HilleVax norovirus VLP candidate, as well as preclinical data with influenza vaccines using our two-component VLP platform.
 Limitations of Current VLP Technologies
 The major drawback of naturally occurring VLPs is that they often cannot be easily engineered to display complex antigen targets or manufactured at commercially relevant scale. Since not all pathogens have protective antigens that


naturally form VLPs, this limits the specific pathogens that can be targeted with this approach. Several developers have and are currently utilizing various other approaches to develop and manufacture VLP-based vaccines. One approach is to use proteins from viruses that naturally form VLPs (e.g., tobacco mosaic virus and HBV) as scaffolds for protective antigens that fail to form VLPs on their own. There are also naturally occurring proteins that self-assemble into particles (e.g., bacterial protein ferritin or lumazine synthase) that can be used as scaffolds for presenting heterologous antigens. The main limitation of the natural scaffold-based approaches is that the structure is fixed resulting in limitations on the size and nature of the antigens that can be incorporated into these particles, as well as the valency and geometry of the antigens presented. Another approach is to use an enveloped VLP that buds from the host cell and contains cellular lipids that make up the lipoprotein envelope. Although this allows for incorporation of complex heterologous antigens, enveloped VLPs can be challenging to purify, with concerns about viral contamination as well as host-cell proteins being carried through to the enveloped VLP, particularly when mammalian expression systems are used. In addition, enveloped VLPs have historically had poor yields, scalability, and stability challenges.
 Our Solution—Two-Component Computationally Designed VLP Technology
 We believe that our two-component VLP platform technology, licensed from the UW, retains the benefits of the naturally occurring VLPs while potentially overcoming the constraints and limitations seen in other VLP technologies to date. Our platform is based on technology developed by researchers at the UW IPD, who pioneered a computationally designed VLP system with potential to address a wide range of vaccine targets.
Our licensed VLP technology encompasses VLPs formed from two protein components that are separately produced using traditional recombinant protein manufacturing techniques. The antigen-bearing Component A consists of a trimeric protein that is genetically fused to the target protein of interest and is produced in eukaryotic cells. The trimeric Component A assembly domain is derived from a thermophilic bacterium and has shown stability at above 70 degrees Celsius, which we believe has the potential to confer stability to the assembled VLP. The second protein, Component B, is a pentameric protein that is produced by bacterial fermentation and assembles cooperatively with Component A to form the VLP.
We are focusing our current development efforts on a single VLP scaffold, which allows for the same Component B to be shared across multiple vaccine candidates featuring different antigens presented on Component A, as illustrated in the graphic below.
 

Component A and Component B are expressed and purified separately prior to assembly. Upon mixture, the two protein components self-assemble into an icosahedral VLP displaying 20 copies of a trimeric antigen, such as RSV or


hMPV, or 60 copies of a monomeric antigen, such as the RBD antigen in the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate, as illustrated below.
 

Using our VLP platform technology we engineer vaccine candidates comprised of self-assembling proteins that are designed to have the following potential benefits:
•Robust, durable, and broad immune responses. The icosahedral symmetry of our VLPs mimics viral geometry and is designed to allow for increased antigen density. In addition, we believe our VLPs are within the optimal size range (20-100 nm) that enables efficient trafficking to the lymph nodes as seen with natural VLPs. Both increased antigen density and lymph node trafficking are known to trigger robust B cell immune responses. We believe that preclinical data support the potential of our platform to generate VLPs that induce high nAb levels, durable immunogenicity and cross-protection against related viral strains.
•Potential to display complex heterologous antigens. Our approach allows for the multivalent display of complex antigens that would not normally form into VLPs.
•Highly scalable manufacturing and ease of purification. Our two-component technology facilitates the use of standard, scalable recombinant protein methods for vaccine manufacturing and purification with well-established cell line and fermentation technologies.
•Increased antigen stability. Our VLPs are designed to confer increased stability to our vaccine candidates, which we believe will allow for improved storage and distribution.
Vaccine Market Overview
 Prior to COVID-19, the global vaccine market was estimated to be over $50 billion in 2020 and was anticipated to grow to over $100 billion by 2027. Over $12.5 billion in 2020 was from vaccines for influenza and pneumococcus, two of the leading causes of pneumonia. Vaccines against COVID-19 have grown the vaccine market considerably in 2021 with estimated sales of over $60 billion. The future endemic market is estimated by market research firms to stabilize at up to $20 billion per year. While mRNA vaccines have contributed largely to the COVID vaccine market, recombinant, conjugate and subunit vaccines, which include VLP-based vaccines, make up over 50% of the non-COVID vaccine market. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the global vaccine market was expected to grow rapidly at a compound annual growth rate of 10% between 2019 and 2027. The increased awareness of infectious diseases and importance of vaccines driven by the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to increase vaccine utilization further, particularly for respiratory viruses.
Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, lower respiratory infection (LRI), including pneumonia, was the leading cause of death and hospitalization from infections and the fourth highest cause of death globally. Older adults are particularly susceptible to respiratory pathogens and it is estimated that prior to COVID-19, LRI caused over one million deaths globally in people over the age of 70 every year. The world adult population over the age of 60 is expected to double by 2050, so prevention of respiratory disease in older adults is a growing commercial opportunity. Many of the viral causes of pneumonia have no approved vaccines, limited treatment options, and result in high morbidity and mortality in the older adult population.
Our Programs
 Our initial focus is on developing vaccine candidates for viral causes of pneumonia in older adults. The following chart summarizes our current programs.
 


VLP technology underlying all candidates is licensed from the UW.


* | Icosavax does not plan to pursue the IVX-121 RSV monovalent candidate as a standalone candidate for RSV in older adults and plans to transition development to the IVX-A12 bivalent RSV/hMPV candidate following Phase 1. The RSV antigen incorporated into IVX-121 is licensed from the National Institutes of Health; key mutations in the hMPV antigen incorporated into IVX-A12 are licensed from the National Institute of Health (NIH) and the University of Texas at Austin (UT).


^ | Icosavax has worldwide nonexclusive rights with the exception of South Korea (which is not included in the licensed territory), which will convert to exclusive rights in North America and Europe (including Switzerland and United Kingdom) starting in 2025, with non-exclusivity maintained elsewhere. As part of our ongoing response to emerging variants, we have initiated preclinical development of a potential Omicron VLP vaccine candidate for evaluation as a possible back-up in COVID-19 or incorporation as a possible component of a multivalent COVID-19 candidate.

 Our current development efforts are focused on addressing the unmet need for safe and effective vaccines against leading causes of LRIs, including pneumonia, in older adults. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased awareness of the impact of LRIs on older adult mortality and morbidity with over 75% of the 934,000 deaths in the United States in people over the age of 65 attributable to LRIs as of February 19, 2022. Even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, LRIs were the fourth leading cause of death worldwide, with morbidity and mortality increasing with age and pre-existing conditions. LRIs caused by pathogens other than SARS-CoV-2 typically lead to over one million deaths worldwide per year in people over 70 years of age and pneumonia is the most common LRI. Many of the viruses found to be associated with pneumonia and LRIs have no approved vaccines, including RSV and hMPV. Other viruses associated with pneumonia, such as influenza, have marketed vaccines but efficacy is often low and variable from year to year.
We have developed each of our vaccine candidates using a robust selection process to identify what we believe is the best antigen. Our selection process includes screening for expression, protein conformation, stability, VLP assembly competence, and evaluation of immunogenicity in multiple animal models, including those that have been previously infected with the pathogen (i.e., primed) when relevant. We in-license antigens where we believe that others’ discoveries may be optimally suited for our technology. We also develop our own antigens in-house.
 IVX-A12 (RSV-hMPV vaccine candidate), a bivalent combination of IVX-121 (RSV vaccine candidate) and IVX-241 (hMPV vaccine candidate)
IVX-A12 is a bivalent combination of IVX-121, which is designed to target RSV, and IVX-241, which is designed to target hMPV. Both IVX-121 and IVX-241 have been designed to display prefusion stabilized F antigens of RSV and hMPV, respectively. The F (fusion) proteins of these viruses are critical for viral entry. F proteins are also one of the main targets for nAbs and are a focus of most vaccine efforts for respiratory viruses such as RSV and hMPV. We have licensed a prefusion stabilized form of the RSV F antigen, DS-Cav1, from the NIH that has been demonstrated in clinical trials conducted by the NIH to be a robust immunogen. An initial clinical trial with DS-Cav1 showed an induction of nAb titers much higher than had previously been seen with other postfusion vaccine approaches to RSV. We have incorporated


DS-Cav1 into our VLP candidate IVX-121. Preclinical data with hMPV antigens provide support for the F antigen as a potential target for protective immunity, and we have incorporated a prefusion F antigen into our VLP candidate IVX-241. The prefusion F antigen in IVX-241 incorporates key mutations that we have licensed from the NIH and the UT. We have been assessing different ratios of IVX-121 and IVX-241 in preclinical studies in an effort to identify the ratio least likely to induce immunologic interference between them prior to initiating clinical trials of IVX-A12. We also plan to conduct a Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate the optimal ratio of IVX-121 to IVX-241 in humans. We believe that multivalent display of these prefusion F antigens on the surface of our VLPs has the potential to induce a robust nAb response capable of conferring protection against infection of both viruses, which we also plan to assess in clinical trials.
We initiated clinical development of IVX-A12 with a clinical trial of IVX-121. We initiated a Phase 1/1b clinical trial in September 2021 to assess the safety and immunogenicity of IVX-121 in adults aged 18-45 and 60-75. We expect to report interim topline data from this trial in the second quarter of 2022. Assuming favorable results, we plan to submit an IND to the FDA and thereafter initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial of IVX-A12 to assess its safety and immunogenicity in healthy younger and older adults. We have completed our pre-IND meeting for the IVX-A12 combination bivalent RSV and hMPV VLP vaccine candidate and we expect to begin our Phase 1 trial for IVX-A12 in the second half of 2022. We believe that a bivalent VLP vaccine targeting RSV and hMPV is an optimal approach to prevent these two common causes of pneumonia, neither of which has an approved vaccine to date.
IVX-A12 Market Opportunity
Marketed vaccines for pneumococcus and influenza, two major causes of pneumonia, had an estimated combined annual 2020 global revenue of $13 billion. RSV and hMPV are also highly prevalent respiratory pathogens that occur seasonally. The largest epidemiological study assessing prevalence of RSV and hMPV that compared with influenza and pneumococcal in adults was the EPIC study published in 2015. Based on this study, the two most common pathogens causing pneumonia in adults after human rhinovirus, influenza pneumococcus and influenza were RSV and hMPV, which were found in 8% and 11%, respectively, of U.S. adults hospitalized for community acquired pneumonia where any pathogen was detected, as shown below.

Pneumococcal and influenza vaccines are important vaccines in the current respiratory vaccine market. Both are recommended for immunization by healthcare policy makers in the United States and other major markets. The global pneumococcal market was estimated to be around $8 billion in 2020 and is projected to grow to around $13.5 billion in 2030. The influenza market size is challenging to estimate due to the number of marketed vaccines worldwide but was estimated to be around $4.5 billion in 2020 and is projected to grow to around $8 billion by 2027. Older adults make up a significant proportion of these sales. Uptake of influenza vaccines in U.S. adults over the age of 65 increased from 70% in the 2019-2020 season to 75% in the 2020-2021 season. Pneumococcal vaccine uptake is also estimated to be around 70% in adults over 65 years of age. Pneumovax23, a pneumococcal vaccine with uptake primarily in the older adult population, had 2021 sales of $890 million. We believe that sales of vaccines for older adults will grow substantially in the future, as the world adult population over the age of 60 is expected to double by 2050.
RSV is estimated to cause 177,000 hospitalizations and 14,000 deaths in adults 65 years of age or older annually in the United States alone. Costs per hospitalization for RSV in older adults are estimated to be at least as great as those of influenza due to longer hospital stays and greater pulmonary complications. The U.S. economic burden for RSV-related hospitalizations alone is estimated to be greater than $2.5 billion per year. Rates of hospitalization and severity of disease for hMPV have been shown to be similar to those seen with RSV and influenza. There are currently no marketed vaccines for RSV or hMPV, two common causes of pneumonia.
In addition, recent data show that both morbidity and mortality in U.S. adults hospitalized with viral pneumonia is higher with both RSV (16.1% likelihood of ICU admission and 5.2% likelihood of death) and hMPV (16.5% likelihood of ICU admission and 3.9% likelihood of death) than with influenza (11.5% likelihood of ICU admission and 3.3% likelihood of death). Given these data, a combined RSV-hMPV vaccine could address a substantial unmet medical need.
We have conducted a primary and quantitative research campaign including interviews with 35 U.S. and EU payors and policy makers and a quantitative survey with 140 U.S. vaccinators (physicians and pharmacists). Data from the study suggest that once launched, an effective RSV vaccine targeting the older adult population could be included in policy (e.g., Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices) guidelines. These guidelines drive recommendations by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and equivalent organizations outside the United States, and can lead to inclusion on payor formularies. This applied to both monovalent (RSV only) and combination vaccines that incorporate an RSV component. The quantitative survey results suggested that policy recommendations were likely to drive immediate vaccine utilization of an RSV vaccine. In addition, survey results suggested that vaccinators were likely to have a strong (90%) preference for a combination RSV-hMPV vaccine over an RSV monovalent vaccine, assuming equivalent efficacy against RSV. Overall, we believe that the survey results supported continued development of a bivalent RSV/hMPV vaccine candidate.
IVX-121—RSV VLP Vaccine Candidate
 Overview of RSV
 RSV is an RNA virus that replicates in the nose and lungs and is a major viral cause of LRI worldwide. There are two major subtypes of RSV, A and B, which may co-circulate in a single RSV season. Re-infection is common, and all older adults are expected to have been exposed to RSV and have RSV-specific antibodies. The most common symptoms are cough, fatigue, dyspnea, congestion, wheezing, and fever.
High Neutralizing Antibody Titers Correlate with Reduced Risk of Infection and Disease
 There is substantial data correlating high nAb titers with protection against RSV. Published preclinical data, natural history studies, human challenge studies, and clinical data all demonstrate reduced risk of infection and disease when higher nAb titers are present. Published natural history studies have demonstrated that once partial protection is achieved, every additional doubling in RSV nAb titer may be associated with an 22-25% decrease in RSV-associated hospitalization. Data from a Phase 2 clinical trial conducted by Sanofi that followed 1,180 subjects aged 65 or older with cardiopulmonary disease over two years at U.S. sites provided additional support that increasing titers correlate with a reduced risk of respiratory illness. As illustrated in the figure below, a doubling of RSV nAb titer was observed to be correlated with a reduced risk of acute respiratory infections (ARIs). Based on these and similar findings, we have designed IVX-121 to increase the magnitude, quality, and durability of the nAb response.

Prefusion RSV-F Protein-Based Vaccines May Generate Higher Neutralizing Antibody Titers than Postfusion Vaccines
 RSV contains several glycoproteins that are important for different functions of the virus, including the surface fusion protein F (RSV-F). RSV-F is a highly conserved glycoprotein that contains the majority of the neutralizing epitopes, specific regions of antigens that bind protective antibodies. We believe RSV-F was validated as a target for protection by the clinical efficacy and approval of Synagis, a monoclonal antibody used to protect against serious lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV in infants at high risk of RSV disease, and RSV-F is the focus of most RSV vaccine development efforts. RSV-F is critical for fusion of the virus with the host cell membrane and the conformation of RSV-F changes significantly between the prefusion or postfusion state. nAbs that bind to prefusion F can block viral entry into cells, thereby reducing viral replication and the severity of RSV-related disease.
The RSV-F protein naturally shifts to the postfusion state and vaccine developers initially focused on vaccines containing the postfusion conformation. These vaccine candidates induced approximately two- to four-fold increases in nAb titers, which was not a sufficient increase in nAb titers to protect a large enough portion of the trial participants to justify continued development.
Data now show that the majority of the nAbs against RSV-F in human sera are directed against the prefusion conformation, and that prefusion directed antibodies have greater neutralizing activity than antibodies directed against the postfusion protein. Researchers at the NIH developed an antigen called DS-Cav1, a prefusion stabilized form of RSV-F that has elicited high titers of nAbs against RSV in mice and nonhuman primates. The NIH conducted an initial Phase 1 trial of DS-Cav1 that showed the antigen induced high nAb titers in humans, much higher than had been seen with postfusion F antigens tested by other developers, as further described below. Although DS-Cav1 provided proof-of-concept (PoC) for prefusion RSV F antigens, DS-Cav1 is not fully stabilized in the prefusion conformation and converts over time to a postfusion structure, which has limited its commercial viability.
We have in-licensed the prefusion RSV-F antigen DS-Cav1 and related technology from the NIH and have incorporated the DS-Cav1 antigen assessed in the NIH Phase 1 trial onto our VLP scaffold. IVX-121 has been designed to display 20 copies of DS-Cav1 as a novel two-component VLP, as shown on the right of the figure below.
 
   


We believe that multivalent, particle-based display of the DS-Cav1 antigen has the potential to improve antigen presentation and B cell receptor cross-linking as has been observed with other VLPs. In addition, we have observed that the fusion of DS-Cav1 to the assembly domain of Component A of the VLP further stabilizes the prefusion structure of RSV-F so that the prefusion conformation is maintained under normal storage conditions.
 Clinical Proof-of-Concept of RSV Prefusion Vaccine from the NIH
 The NIH conducted a Phase 1 trial of DS-Cav1 in healthy volunteers to evaluate dose, safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of the stabilized RSV prefusion subunit protein vaccine alone or with aluminum hydroxide (alum), a commonly used aluminum salt adjuvant. Adjuvants can be used to induce a stronger immune response in people vaccinated. Aluminum salts are a widely used adjuvant in human vaccines and pose a low safety risk to humans based on hundreds of studies conducted to date with aluminum salt adjuvanted vaccines. In the NIH trial, 95 healthy adult subjects 18-50 years of age were vaccinated with formulations of DS-Cav1 with or without alum at dose levels of 50, 150, or 500 micrograms of prefusion antigen. Subjects received intramuscular vaccinations at day 0 and at week 12. Published results demonstrated that a single immunization resulted in a 5.1 to 10.6-fold increase in nAb titers from baseline to week 4 against RSV/A, as illustrated in the figure on the right below. A second immunization did not impact long-term neutralization. Although NIH’s trial did not include a head-to-head comparison against other RSV vaccine candidates, the increase in nAb titers from baseline observed in this trial was higher than the ~1.5 to 4-fold rises observed with previous postfusion RSV-F protein-based vaccine candidates. As an example, in Novavax’s Phase 1 clinical trial of an RSV-F candidate in adults aged 18-49, a 1.5 to 2.4-fold rise across non-adjuvanted or aluminum salt (Adjuphos) adjuvanted groups was observed over a similar time period, as illustrated in the figure on the left below. We believe the NIH data supported the hypothesis that stabilizing the prefusion structure has the potential to improve the functional immune response against the RSV F antigen. Neutralizing titers against the important viral subtype RSV/B were also increased 4.4 to 8.4-fold in the NIH trial, indicating comparative increases in breadth of the humoral response. The aluminum salt adjuvants showed limited effect in both the NIH and Novavax trials.

 IVX-121 Prefusion F Protein Stability
 In preclinical studies, we have observed that the fusion of DS-Cav1 to Component A further stabilized the prefusion conformation and the resultant assembled VLP was very stable at two to eight degrees Celsius, which is a typical temperature range for vaccine storage. In comparison, long-term storage of DS-Cav1 at four degrees Celsius resulted in a shift away from the prefusion stabilized structure as measured by reduction of prefusion specific antibody binding, including D25 binding, by 102 days.
IVX-121 Preclinical Results
 We have completed multiple preclinical studies of IVX-121 and precursor candidates in animal models of RSV. As all adults are expected to have been exposed to RSV, we believe the most relevant animal models are those that use animals that are first infected with RSV prior to vaccination. In these models, animals’ immune systems are given prior exposure to the virus (i.e., primed), similar to what would be expected in human adults.
 IVX-121 Preclinical Data in RSV-Primed Models. To evaluate the ability of IVX-121 to stimulate immune responses in animals with pre-existing immunity, BALB/c mice were infected with RSV and allowed to recover over a 3-month period. To reduce experimental variability, animals were randomized into groups based on their Day 28 RSV/A neutralizing titers. Animals were evaluated for pre-boost baseline titers on Day 91 and then immunized with either IVX-121 or soluble DS-Cav1 vaccine formulations, with or without Alhydrogel, a commonly used aluminum-based adjuvant. Ten days after the immunization blood was collected for assessment of nAb titers.
 To account for variability in the immune response of individual animals to RSV infection, it is necessary to evaluate the relative rise in nAb titers over baseline in each animal. Dose levels of IVX-121 were matched with dose levels of DS-Cav1 meaning a 0.1 microgram dose of IVX-121 would have 0.1 micrograms of DS-Cav1 in the VLP preparation.
As shown in the figure below, IVX-121 induced strong nAb responses that were statistically superior to DS-Cav1 at the 0.1 microgram dose (p<0.05) using both parametric (t-test) and non-parametric tests (Wilcoxon test). The maximum increase in nAb titers (>15x) for the aqueous IVX-121 formulation was seen at the 0.3 microgram dose level, which was higher than the increase observed with the equivalent dose of DS-Cav1, although the results were not statistically


significant. At the 1 microgram dose IVX-121 and soluble DS-Cav1 induced similar increases in nAb titers. Use of Alhydrogel did not significantly increase the immune response to IVX-121 in RSV-primed mice (not shown).

 A p-value is the probability that the reported result was achieved purely by chance, such that a p-value of less than or equal to 0.05 means that there is a less than or equal to 5% probability that the difference between the control group and the treatment group is purely due to chance. A p-value of 0.05 or less typically represents a statistically significant result. The FDA’s evidentiary standard of efficacy when evaluating the results of a clinical trial generally relies on a p-value of less than or equal to 0.05.
In addition, to assess the cellular immune response to IVX-121 splenocytes from individual mice were collected and analyzed in an IFN-gamma ELISpot assay following stimulation with F-specific peptide. As compared to a saline control group, IVX-121 treated mice showed an increase in IFN-gamma positive CD4+ T cells, which suggests a boosted cellular immune response induced by IVX-121.
 Preclinical Data in RSV-naïve Animals. Studies performed at the UW IPD on a precursor VLP-based antigen to IVX-121, DS-Cav1-I53-50, showed superiority of the multivalent, VLP presentation of DS-Cav1 over the soluble antigen. The preclinical studies with DS-Cav1-I53-50 in both naïve (non-primed) mice and naïve non-human primates, demonstrated a ~10-fold increase in neutralizing titers over the soluble DS-Cav1 antigen. In the mouse study, DS-Cav1 and DS-Cav1-I53-50 were formulated with the oil-in-water adjuvant Addavax and a 5 mcg DS-Cav1 dose equivalent was utilized for all groups. A statistically significant difference in nAbs titers induced by DS-Cav1-I53-50 and DS-Cav1 was observed (p<0.01). In the primate study, DS-Cav1 and DS-Cav1-I53-50 were formulated with the oil-in-water adjuvant SWE and a 50 mcg DS-Cav1 equivalent dose was given to both groups. A statistically significant difference in nAbs titers induced by DS-Cav1-I53-50 and DS-Cav1 was observed (p<0.05). In a subset of the primates, bone marrow was collected to assess level of induction of antigen-specific long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs), an early marker of a potential durable immune response. Primates immunized with the DS-Cav1-I53-50 VLPs showed a non-significant, but numerical increase in antigen-specific LLPC induction in bone marrow and spleen compared with animals immunized with soluble DS-Cav1. A separate non-human primate study evaluated the potential impact of Adjuphos, an aluminum salt adjuvant different from the one we plan to use in the clinic, on the IVX-121 formulation. The formulation of IVX-121 using Adjuphos induced similar levels of nAb titers to DS-Cav1 formulated with Adjuphos. The specific aluminum salt adjuvant we plan to utilize in clinical testing is Alhydrogel. Preclinical data in naïve mice suggest this adjuvant could yield improved nAb titers in naïve animals.
 IVX-121 Preclinical Safety Studies. We have completed a Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) toxicology study to support regulatory submissions and entry into Phase 1 trials in Europe. The toxicology study evaluated both injection site and systemic reactions to the vaccine candidate. No adverse effects were seen following administration of the anticipated


maximum human dose of IVX-121 (250ug +/- Alhydrogel), with minor injection site reactivity comparable to animals receiving saline control. The only histological finding that differed from the saline control was a modest increase in the spleens of animals receiving IVX-121, consistent with the induction of a robust immune response.
 IVX-241 hMPV VLP Vaccine Candidate
 Overview of hMPV
 hMPV is an RNA virus that is related to the RSV virus. hMPV was first identified in 2001, though it was likely in circulation for at least 50 years prior to discovery. Infection with hMPV brings a similar symptomatic profile as RSV with the most common symptoms being cough, wheezing, dyspnea, congestion and fatigue. Similar to RSV, there are two genetic lineages of hMPV, hMPV/A and hMPV/B, which show a high degree of sequence homology and co-circulate with varying annual prevalence of each strain. The hMPV virus has several highly conserved viral proteins including a fusion protein (F). Preclinical studies have demonstrated that immunization with the F protein is capable of inducing nAbs and protecting against viral challenge in animal models. Vaccination with an F protein from one lineage has been shown to result in nAb titers capable of protection against both hMPV strains, though titers against the heterologous strain are often lower. Similar to RSV, the F protein of hMPV undergoes a conformational change from the prefusion to the postfusion structure to enable entry into the host cell. Recent data indicate that prefusion stabilization of the F protein results in an improved immunogenicity profile in mice, similar to results previously seen with RSV. Our development is focused on a pre-fusion stabilized hMPV antigen.
RSV, hMPV, and influenza seasons show high seasonal overlap and hMPV is underdiagnosed and often mistaken for RSV or influenza given the similarity in clinical presentation. As diagnostic tools improve, hMPV is being increasingly recognized as a major contributor to ARI and LRI. Similar to RSV, prospective cohorts from third-party clinical trials have shown that higher baseline hMPV nAbs were associated with reduced risk of hMPV symptomatic virus infection, so the goal of vaccination is to increase hMPV nAbs. There are currently no FDA-approved antivirals or vaccines to treat or prevent hMPV.
 hMPV Antigen Selection and Immunogenicity Results
 Expression of the hMPV F protein has been shown to be challenging and efforts have been made to introduce modifications within the protein to improve expression and stabilize the prefusion structure. We evaluated a number of potential candidate antigens for compatibility with our two-component VLP platform and selected IVX-241. IVX-241 incorporates an F antigen from hMPV/A and was selected based on key criteria, including: high expression, prefusion conformation, monodispersity, VLP stability, and high nAb titers following VLP administration in rodent studies.
Activity of IVX-A12 via Intramuscular Administration in Cotton Rat Model
 To evaluate the potential of IVX-121, IVX-241 or IVX-A12 formulated with Addavax (oil-in-water adjuvant) to protect in a live virus (RSV/A and hMPV/A) challenge model, cotton rats were administered two doses of IVX-121, IVX-241 or IVX-A12 (1 ug of each VLP) on day 0 and day 21 and subsequently challenged with RSV/A or hMPV/A two weeks post the second administration.
 Strong nAb titers against RSV and hMPV were observed in the animals two weeks post the second VLP administration and prior to challenge. Titers in monovalent and bivalent formulations were equivalent. The animals were challenged intranasally with 105 plaque forming units (PFU) of either RSV/A2 or hMPV/A and lung tissue samples tested 5 days post challenge for viral replication. Cotton rats that were not vaccinated but challenged with RSV or hMPV resulted in substantial viral titers in the lung. Monovalent or bivalent formulations blocked viral replication of each of RSV and hMPV to below the lower limit of quantitation.
 


   We are also currently evaluating IVX-A12 in a GLP toxicology study.
 IVX-A12 RSV-hMPV Combination Vaccine Candidate Clinical Development Plan
 We intend to pursue regulatory approval of our RSV/hMPV combination VLP candidate IVX-A12 in the older adult population. As is standard for vaccine development where correlates of protection have not been identified, we plan to first evaluate the immunogenicity of our vaccine candidate in a Phase 1 first-in-human (FIH) trial in healthy young and older adults by measuring the change in RSV and hMPV nAb levels compared to baseline antibody levels. We also plan to


assess different combinations of RSV and hMPV for potential immune interference caused by the addition of hMPV VLPs to the RSV VLP vaccine candidate. Contingent upon favorable safety results, demonstration of immunogenicity and determination of the optimal RSV-hMPV dose combination, we plan to assess the efficacy of our RSV-hMPV combination vaccine candidate. We expect that the efficacy will be assessed by measuring incidence of LRI caused by either RSV or hMPV in patients receiving IVX-A12 compared to those receiving placebo.
We are evaluating both unadjuvanted and Alhydrogel-adjuvanted RSV monovalent VLP candidate IVX-121 formulations in our Phase 1 FIH trial. However, based on the NIH and our own preclinical studies, we may not see a significant enhancement in the nAb titers induced by Alhydrogel adjuvant. For this reason, in parallel with the clinical assessment of IVX-121, we also are assessing alternative adjuvants in our ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial of IVX-411 and in preclinical studies with our combination candidate IVX-A12. Based on the IVX-121 and IVX-411 clinical data as well as preclinical data to be generated with respect to IVX-121, IVX-241 and related candidates, and different formulations of IVX-A12, we will determine whether to investigate an adjuvanted formulation, in addition to a non-adjuvanted formulation for the planned Phase 1 clinical trial of IVX-A12.
 IVX-121 Phase 1/1b and IVX-121 Phase 1b Extension Trial
 Our plan for the clinical development of IVX-A12 is to first assess safety and immunogenicity of the RSV monovalent VLP candidate IVX-121 in an initial Phase 1/1b trial, which was initiated in September 2021.
This FIH trial with IVX-121 is a randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled multi-center Phase 1/1b trial designed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of three dose levels of non-adjuvanted and Alhydrogel-adjuvanted IVX-121 in two adult cohorts: 18-45 years of age (Phase 1) and 60-75 years of age (Phase 1b). Dosing in this study has completed, with 90 adults 18-45 years of age and 130 adults 60-75 years of age dosed with IVX-121, respectively. All subjects in the trial are being evaluated for safety and persistence of antibody response for six months following a single intramuscular administration of either IVX-121 or placebo.
 We expect to conduct an interim analysis of the IVX-121 Phase 1/1b trial to determine the IVX-121 dose level to be assessed in the IVX-A12 combination Phase 1 trial. We are also currently evaluating alternative adjuvant formulations in preclinical studies and will assess the need for an alternative adjuvant in the initial IVX-A12 clinical trial pending the outcome of the Phase 1/1b IVX-121 and Phase 1/2 IVX-411 clinical trials, and preclinical evaluation of different formulations of IVX-A12.
 We also plan to enroll a subset of older adult subjects who completed the Phase 1b part of the trial into a Phase 1b extension trial. The Phase 1b extension trial will begin with a continuation of the follow up period of up to approximately twelve months after first dosing to monitor for safety and to evaluate persistence of antibodies. Twelve months following their first IVX-121 administration, we plan to administer a single booster dose of unadjuvanted IVX-121 to enrolled subjects and follow them for an additional six months to evaluate safety and immune responses to the booster dose. Safety assessments will include solicited adverse events (AEs), unsolicited AEs, and serious AEs throughout the 28-day treatment period following booster vaccination.
IVX-A12 Phase 1 Trial
 We completed a pre-IND interaction with the FDA for the IVX-A12 combination bivalent RSV-hMPV VLP vaccine candidate in the fourth quarter of 2021, and we expect to begin our Phase 1 trial for IVX-A12 in the second half of 2022. We will evaluate the combination candidate IVX-A12 in this trial, with no evaluation of IVX-241 as a monovalent candidate.
The goal of the planned Phase 1 trial of IVX-A12 will be to assess safety and immunogenicity of varying doses of IVX-A12, with and without adjuvant, in healthy young adults 18-45 years of age, and older adults 60-75 years of age. The adjuvant to be assessed will depend on preclinical data on IVX-A12 as well as clinical data from the IVX-121 and IVX-411 clinical trials. In the planned Phase 1 trial, IVX-A12 will be given with a fixed IVX-121 dose and one of three dose levels of IVX-241 VLP formulated with and without adjuvant. We expect this design will enable evaluation of the immune responses to both individual components of IVX-A12 and to see if the combination of VLPs increases the reactogenicity or leads to immune interference (i.e., imbalanced immune responses to component VLPs). All subjects in the Phase 1 trial will be evaluated for safety and antibody response for twelve months following administration of IVX-A12 or placebo. Our plan is


to proceed dosing with cohorts receiving one- and two-dose regimens and to evaluate interim data from the Phase 1 trial to determine the need for adjuvant, and to select the dose regimen for evaluation in the Phase 2 dose-confirmation trial.
 IVX-A12 Phase 2 Dose-Confirmation Trial
 Following completion of the IVX-A12 Phase 1 clinical trial, we plan to initiate a Phase 2 dose-confirmation clinical trial in healthy older adults 60-75 years of age. We plan to select the formulations and dose regimen for evaluation in the Phase 2 clinical trial based on data from the IVX-A12 Phase 1 trial. Our planned Phase 2 clinical trial will evaluate different combinations of varying concentrations of hMPV and RSV VLPs in healthy older adults to assess safety and immunogenicity of varying concentrations of hMPV and RSV VLPs, and guide final dose selection for a subsequent PoC Phase 2b trial.
IVX-A12 Phase 2 Extension Trial
 We plan to enroll older adult subjects who complete the Phase 2 trial into a Phase 2 extension trial to assess duration of antibody persistence and long-term safety over multiple years.
IVX-A12 Phase 2b PoC Trial
 We plan to conduct a global Phase 2b randomized observer-blind placebo-controlled PoC efficacy trial to evaluate the formulation of IVX-A12 selected from the Phase 2 dose-confirmation trial. The planned PoC objectives for the Phase 2b trial will include assessment of safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy against LRI caused by either RSV or hMPV. We expect that the trial population will include adults 60 years of age or older, including nested cohorts of frail and at-risk elderly, as well as healthy subjects over 85 years of age.
 SARS-CoV-2
We are developing additional vaccine candidates as part of our strategy to develop combination VLP vaccines in older adults. IVX-411 is designed to present 60 copies of the RBD protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus strain first identified in China (original viral strain). We have also initiated preclinical development of candidates incorporating RBD variants, including Omicron, for evaluation as possible back-up candidates or as components of a multivalent COVID-19 vaccine candidate. For our COVID-19 vaccine candidates, we have a license from the UW that is nonexclusive worldwide, with the exception of South Korea (which is not included in the licensed territory). This license will become exclusive in the United States, Canada, Mexico and Europe (including Switzerland and United Kingdom) starting in 2025 with non-exclusivity maintained elsewhere. SK Biosciences (SK) has also licensed the technology for use in COVID-19 vaccines. SK has completed a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in South Korea, and has begun Phase 3 clinical trials, as well as rolling registration applications with the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the South Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS), for a product candidate similar to IVX-411, and is also pursuing variant vaccine candidates.
 In October 2020, we announced a grant for $10 million, awarded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF), a global non-profit dedicated to improving global health. We deployed this grant to evaluate IVX-411 in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial that we initiated in Australia in June 2021. In this clinical trial, we are evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of IVX-411 in naïve subjects and previously vaccinated individuals for its potential use as a booster vaccine. Topline interim data from this ongoing clinical trial were announced in March 2022. Overall, although an immune response was observed and the initial reactogenicity data were favorable, the immunogenicity response was below our expectations and inconsistent with preclinical data on our platform and other data on similar VLP technology, including SK’s COVID-19 VLP vaccine. Further analysis of the data and our IVX-411 vaccine candidate is ongoing, including an investigation into the manufacture, shipment, and administration of the vaccine candidate in the Phase 1/2 clinical trial. Based on the results of these efforts, we will review our plans for the clinical development of IVX-411 and variant candidates, including a potential Omicron or multivalent back-up candidate. We remain committed to the development of pan-respiratory vaccine(s) incorporating COVID-19.
IVX-411—Our COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate
 Overview of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19
 

SARS-CoV-2 is a viral pathogen responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic. As of February 2022, there were over 430 million cumulative cases and over 5.9 million deaths from COVID-19 worldwide with over 900,000 deaths in the United States alone. Rates of serious morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 are disproportionately higher in older adults as compared to other age groups, likely due to age-induced immunosenescence. Although adults aged 65 or older constitute about 17% of the United States population, over 75% of the deaths in the United States due to COVID-19 have been in this age group, as illustrated in the graph below.

 Vaccines have been developed to combat the COVID-19 pandemic at an unprecedented pace and there are several mRNA and adenoviral vector-based COVID-19 vaccines that have been licensed or approved under EUA in the United States and other countries. Data have been publicly released regarding different SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates, including protein-based vaccines and the VLP vaccine candidates being developed by Medicago, Bavarian Nordic, and SK, that have shown high nAb induction. We believe these data support continued development of VLP-based vaccines such as IVX-411. Further, development of the first wave of vaccines to fight the pandemic focused on speed rather than other critical attributes that are now important considerations for second wave vaccine candidates such as durability, potential to address variant strains, ease of manufacturing and distribution, stability, and reactogenicity profile.
 Coronaviruses are prone to mutation but the pace at which the SARS-CoV-2 virus has mutated is faster than many were anticipating. Some of these emerging strains appear to enhance transmission and pathogenicity, with complete replacement of the original pathogen by the emerging strains in some countries. Data has shown that some vaccines against the original SARS-CoV-2 virus strain are less immunogenic against some of the emerging variants, particularly the Beta and Omicron variants. Several companies have initiated efforts to make either booster shots to supplement existing vaccines to address emerging variants or new vaccines incorporating key mutations found in variant strains. However, it remains to be seen if initial exposure to the original strain through natural infection or vaccination has resulted in a focusing of the immune system on the original strain in such a way as to interfere with the development of an immune response against the new strain, a phenomenon called “original antigenic sin”.
 We believe that there are still gaps in the COVID-19 vaccine landscape that need to be filled by new vaccine candidates. We believe that our technology may have the potential to address these gaps:
•Global access to effective vaccines against variant strains: We believe that highly scalable vaccines will be needed in order to address the ongoing demand for billions of doses worldwide. We aim to develop vaccines targeting the prevalent strains to induce high nAb levels, which we believe may be able to more 
 

effectively protect against emerging variants than the first wave vaccines.
•Reduced reactogenicity: Reactogenicity of the mRNA vaccines appears to remain high with subsequent doses; we believe that in the long-term less reactogenic vaccines will be preferred, particularly if repetitive boosters are needed. We believe that a COVID-19 VLP vaccine candidate has the potential to be less reactogenic.
•Ability to overcome “original antigenic sin”: We believe that new vaccines targeting specific key mutations in the variant SARS-CoV-2 virus strains may be less effective in individuals already exposed to the original SARS-CoV-2 strain through infection or vaccination. We further believe that variant vaccines developed using differentiated technologies, expressed viral proteins, or formulations with different adjuvants may be more successful in overcoming the original-strain immune-focused memory response present in these individuals, particularly if they are able to induce high nAb titers.
•Ability to confer long-lasting protection: The durability of currently marketed vaccines against COVID-19 appears to be suboptimal, with boosters proving to be necessary and developers suggesting a potential need for annual vaccinations. We believe this drives a need for vaccines with longer duration of response.
•Ability to be incorporated into pan-respiratory combinations: We predict that as more vaccines targeting the older adult community are developed, combination vaccines will become the preferred approach for older adults, similar to what has occurred with pediatric vaccines. We believe that a SARS-CoV-2 antigen is an important part of a future combination vaccine, and that our technology may be suited to combination vaccines because of its potential combinability and low reactogenicity.
COVID-19 Vaccine Candidates
 IVX-411 is our current lead COVID-19 vaccine candidate that incorporates the ACE2 RBD from the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein of the original virus. The RBD is a fragment of the S protein that contains several known nAb epitopes, including those that prevent viral entry, and is responsible for ~90% of the nAb titers induced following SARS-CoV-2 infection. The RBD protein in IVX-411 is genetically fused to Component A and manufactured in mammalian cells. Component A-RBD is then combined with the same Component B used for our other programs to make the fully assembled VLPs, each of which incorporates 60 copies of the monomeric RBD antigen. We are evaluating IVX-411 in the clinic in both aqueous (non-adjuvanted) and adjuvanted formulations. We chose to move into clinical development with an oil-in-water adjuvant based on preclinical adjuvant comparison data and clinical data on other products using similar adjuvants.
We also initiated preclinical development of candidates incorporating RBD proteins with critical mutations found in variant SARS-CoV-2 virus strains, including Omicron, for evaluation as possible back-up candidates or as components of a multivalent COVID-19 vaccine candidate. In our preclinical studies we assess whether these variant-specific candidates induce stronger immunogenicity against variant strains than seen with IVX-411. Following review of clinical data on IVX-411 and preclinical data on variant-specific backup and multivalent candidates, we may incorporate one of these candidates into our clinical evaluation plan.
Our COVID-19 vaccine candidates including IVX-411 were designed to utilize the same VLP backbone as other candidates in our pipeline and to have the following potential advantages:
•Robust immunogenicity, durability, and breadth of response: Our candidates including IVX-411 incorporate the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 on the VLP and we believe this design has the potential to improve the functional antibody response as compared to many spike soluble antibody approaches.
•Scalability and stability: Our vaccine development process leverages highly scalable recombinant protein production with well-established cell line and fermentation technologies. In addition, our VLP vaccine candidates are highly thermostable and we have designed the final drug product to be stable at two to eight degrees Celsius. We believe the potential scalability and stability of our vaccine candidates will allow for a lower cost of goods, as well as ease of scaled-up manufacturing and distribution, compared to other 
 

vaccine approaches such as mRNA vaccines. We believe both scalability and thermostability are especially important for addressing the large-scale need for billions of doses worldwide.
 •Ability to boost: In an endemic setting, we believe the ability to boost and sustain immune response against the prevalent strains will become increasingly important.
•Potential to boost multiple times with same vaccine candidate (homologous boosting): Our candidates are protein-based VLPs, and we have not observed interference after multiple doses in several species. We believe that our candidates including IVX-411 have the potential to be administered multiple times without risk of interference or anti-vector immunity that has historically been seen in other approaches, such as vector-based approaches.
•Potential to boost response from alternative vaccine technologies (heterologous boosting): We believe that protein-based vaccines, which strongly enhance nAb levels, may be ideal booster vaccines for other vaccine technologies such as adenoviral vector vaccines. In addition, we believe that to overcome original antigenic sin, the heterologous vaccine regimen used for boosting may need to be distinct from the initial vaccine regimen, particularly when attempting to boost a response to a variant virus strain. As our VLP vaccine candidates present the RBD subunit, we believe they are distinct from most of the other vaccines on market presenting the full Spike antigen and may be capable of boosting response from marketed heterologous vaccine regimens.
 In March 2022 we reported interim topline results from our IVX-411 Phase 1/2 clinical trial, as further described below. Overall, the level of immunogenicity response was below our expectations given what we know about VLPs, including from SK clinical data on a similar COVID-19 vaccine candidate and from our own preclinical data. We have initiated an investigation into the potential causes of these discordant clinical results, including manufacture, shipment, and administration of the vaccine candidate, and continue to believe that a COVID-19 VLP vaccine candidate based on the technology licensed to us from UW has the potential to provide the advantages listed above.
We have a worldwide non-exclusive license to our COVID-19 vaccine candidates from the UW, with the exception of South Korea, where we have no license. This license will become exclusive in the United States, Canada, Mexico and Europe (including Switzerland and United Kingdom) starting in 2025 with maintenance of our non-exclusive rights elsewhere. SK also has a non-exclusive license to develop COVID-19 candidates based on the UW technology. We are monitoring the landscape closely, and, pending our review of the interim topline results, and of our investigation relating to IVX-411 as administered in our Phase 1/2 clinical trial, we will determine the path forward for our COVID-19 vaccine candidates.
 BMGF supported work by the UW IPD to design and evaluate COVID-19 vaccine candidates. We also received a grant from BMGF to enable development of our COVID-19 vaccine candidate through Phase 1 clinical testing and in return for our grant funds, we have agreed to access and price commitments specific for low- and middle-income countries for this candidate.
 IVX-411 Preclinical Results
 Summary
 To date, IVX-411 and closely related precursor molecules have been tested in mice, rats, and nonhuman primates. The immunogenicity generated in mice after vaccination with closely related precursor VLPs formulated with an oil-in-water adjuvant was durable, with nAb titers remaining as high 20-24 weeks following the boosting dose as they were two weeks post-boost. In addition, preclinical nonhuman primate data from assessment of a closely related precursor candidate with several different adjuvant formulations showed induction of robust nAb titers well in excess of titers seen in human convalescent sera, as well as protection from viral challenge.
 Preclinical data of related candidates
 The BMGF has sponsored several preclinical studies incorporating the UW precursor candidate used in both SK Biosciences' GBP510 and our IVX-411 vaccine candidates. In these preclinical studies in rodents and non-human primates, the candidates were evaluated with several adjuvants. The most recent study in non-human primates showed nAb titers against the wild-type strain that were maintained at a high level for at least six months after two doses. Although following a primary regimen, titers against the Omicron strain were relatively low compared with those against the wild


type virus, there was a significant impact of a booster at month 6 against the Omicron strain. Overall, we believe this data supports the potential for durability and breadth of response of our VLP platform.
 IVX-411 Preclinical Data in Naïve Mice
 To evaluate the potential of IVX-411 to stimulate an immune response to the original and Beta variant SARS-CoV-2 strains, BALB/c mice were administered IVX-411 with and without MF59. All animals were administered two doses three weeks apart and blood was collected two weeks following the second dose for measurement of neutralizing titers against the original and Beta strains. As shown in the figure below, IVX-411 adjuvanted with MF59 induced robust nAb responses that were higher than those observed for IVX-411 alone, although the results were not statistically significant, and induced nAb titers (mean nAb titer of 26,979 across all animals) that were higher than those observed in human convalescent serum (mean nAb titer of 3,492 across all runs of a single HCS sample). In addition, the nAb titers induced by IVX-411 adjuvanted with MF59 against the Beta variant (mean nAb titer of 25,699 across all animals) were similar to nAb titers against the original strain (mean nAb titer of 26,979 across all animals), which was in contrast to human convalescent sera, which showed a significant drop in nAb titers between the original strain (mean nAb titer of 3,492 across all runs of a single HCS sample) and the Beta strain (mean nAb titer of 154 across all runs of a single HCS sample).
IVX-411 Safety Data
 We have completed a GLP toxicology repeat intramuscular dose study in rats to support regulatory submissions and initiation of our ongoing and planned Phase 1/2 clinical trials in Australia, United States, and Europe. The study evaluated both injection site and systemic reactions to IVX-411, including non-adjuvanted and adjuvanted formulations. No test article-related effects were seen following administration of IVX-411 on mortality, clinical observations, ophthalmic observations, body weights, food consumption, or body temperature. No observed effects were considered adverse.
COVID-19 Vaccine Candidates Clinical Development Plan
 We are conducting a Phase 1/2 randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded, dose-escalation clinical trial evaluating safety and immunogenicity of IVX-411, and reported interim topline data in March 2022. The trial is designed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of IVX-411 administered as primary and booster vaccines. There are two parts to the trial. Part 1 is a Phase 1 assessment of primary vaccination with IVX-411 in adults 18-69 years of age who have not been previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2 (seronegative). Part 2 is a Phase 2 evaluation of IVX-411 booster vaccination in adults previously exposed through COVID-19 vaccination (seropositive). IVX-411, either unadjuvanted or formulated with MF59 adjuvant, was administered in either one or two-dose regimens. For groups receiving two doses, administration of doses was 28 days apart.
 

A schema of the Phase 1/2 trial design is given in the figure below:
    
In Parts 1 and 2, six formulations of IVX-411 were tested, including three dose levels each tested with and without MF59 adjuvant.
IVX-411 Clinical Results
 Safety
 In this topline interim data, IVX-411 was generally safe and well-tolerated. Solicited local and systemic AEs were all mild or moderate, without dose-limiting reactogenicity. The most common local and systemic AEs were injection site tenderness, and headache and fatigue, respectively. There were no serious AEs deemed to be related to vaccine, AE of special interest, or AEs leading to discontinuation. In the naïve setting, across the six dosage groups for IVX-411 with or without adjuvant, the proportion of subjects experiencing any systemic AE within seven days of any dose was 33-67%, versus 50% for placebo. In the booster setting, across the six dosage groups, 17-42% of subjects experienced any systemic AE within seven days of the booster dose, versus 25% for placebo.
Immunogenicity
 In the naïve setting, a clear adjuvant effect on immunogenicity and a dose response were observed with IVX-411; however, the level of immune response in this initial data was comparable to or below the Human Convalescent Sera (HCS) control. At day 49 (or three weeks following the second dose), responses were up to 154 IU/mL across dosage groups in the live virus neutralization assay (HCS: 281 IU/mL), and up to 592 BAU/mL across groups in the spike IgG assay (HCS: 361 BAU/mL).
 In previously vaccinated subjects, these initial data showed that IVX-411 boosted immunity following primary vaccination with an mRNA or adenovirus vaccine, and adjuvanted and unadjuvanted groups were generally similar. Pre- versus post-boost fold increases of up to 5x (599 IU/mL) for wild type virus were observed at day 28 post boost. For the Omicron variant, neutralizing antibody titers were up to 8-fold lower than observed for wild type virus in the same assay.
 Overall, the level of immunogenicity response was below our expectations given what we know about VLPs, including from SK clinical data on a similar COVID-19 vaccine candidate and from our own preclinical data. We have initiated an investigation into the potential causes of these discordant clinical results, including manufacture, shipment, and administration of the product.
 Based on the outcome of the investigation, as well as additional evaluation of preclinical and clinical data, our ongoing evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 variants, the state of the vaccine landscape for COVID-19, the regulatory guidelines on clinical development of COVID-19 vaccines and additional factors as appropriate, we will determine our future development efforts for IVX-411 and backup candidates.
Influenza Program
 Overview of Influenza
 

Influenza is caused by a respiratory viral pathogen that infects the nose, throat, and lungs. There are two main types of flu viruses: types A and B. Viral nomenclature is based on two genes in the virus, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), that are critical for viral entry and release from cells, as well as species specificity. There are multiple distinct versions of both HA and NA that are numbered to describe related sequences and result in the name of specific viruses. The flu A and B viruses that routinely spread in people are responsible for seasonal flu epidemics each year. Existing vaccines have sub-par efficacy (ranging from 10% to 60% year to year) and need to be updated seasonally due to changes in the genetic sequences of the dominant viral variants that circulate in response to human immune pressure.
The reduced efficacy of seasonal influenza vaccines is due in part to the fact that current vaccines are designed to target a narrow subset of predicted strains, and mispredictions about the dominant circulating strain are common as manufacturing must proceed based on data from the previous seasonal epidemic. Another cause of reduced efficacy is that flu vaccines are often manufactured in chicken eggs, and egg-adapted mutations in protective antigens (i.e., HA) can occur during the manufacturing process that reduce the potency of those vaccines for the viruses that are circulating in humans. The low efficacy of current influenza vaccines leaves an unmet need for an influenza vaccine with improved efficacy. This is particularly needed in the older adult population, who are less likely than other age groups to respond to conventional vaccines. In seasonal influenza, vaccines have historically been up to approximately two times less effective in adults 65 and older compared to other adult age groups.

 * 2020-2021 flu vaccine effectiveness was not estimated due to low flu virus circulation during the 2020-2021 flu season
 **Interim vaccine effectiveness estimates, as of March 2022
 Influenza results in an estimated 500,000 hospitalizations and 35,000 deaths per year in the United States despite numerous marketed vaccines. Many of these hospitalizations and deaths are in people over the age of 65. In the 2019-2020 flu season, for example, 45% of the hospitalizations and 59% of the deaths were in people over the age of 65.
In addition to the recurring burden of disease of seasonal influenza, there are concerns about the potential for influenza pandemics, which occur when novel animal viruses jump the species barrier to humans as has occurred with SARS2. In 1917, the H1N1 pandemic is estimated to have killed between 50-100 million individuals. Improved vaccine technologies that can rapidly scale vaccine production and provide robust protection against future pandemics are also needed.
Data from a collaboration between the UW and National Institutes of Health has already established PoC for improved responses to influenza vaccines based on the two-component VLP vaccine technology when compared to commercial quadrivalent influenza vaccines (QIV). In preclinical studies in mice, ferrets and NHPs HA proteins from 4 influenza strains (either as a mixture of 4 different VLPs, called a cocktail, or on a single VLP presenting all 4 HA proteins, called a mosaic) generated equal or superior neutralizing responses to the homologous influenza virus as commercial QIV. Importantly, antibodies induced by the VLPs were better able to neutralize viruses that were mismatched to the


vaccine strain than QIV. This included strains of avian influenza such as H5N1 that were absent from the vaccine, the mechanism of which was thought to be in part based on the induction of “universal” antibodies (i.e., anti-HA stalk, the portion of HA that is directly responsible for membrane fusion and viral entry into the cell) that are not readily induced by QIV.
 

Source: Boyoglu-Barnum et al. 2021
 The ability to neutralize “drifted” strains is potentially indicative of a broader immune response that could provide superior protection in years when the selection of antigens for influenza vaccines is imperfectly matched to the dominant circulating strains. In addition, the ability to generate neutralizing antibodies against H5N1 with seasonal HA antigens suggests VLP-based vaccines could potentially contribute to protection against influenza pandemics. The NIH is currently running a Phase 1 trial with mosaic VLPs based on the two-component VLP platform, with initial results expected in 2022.
 Influenza Candidate Development
Icosavax is developing a recombinant influenza vaccine candidate based on the two-component VLP platform. We licensed the rights to develop and commercialize an influenza VLP vaccine from UW based on technology developed by UW and NIH. We have initiated preclinical development on a quadrivalent influenza VLP candidate. We see our emerging flu program as part of our strategy to develop combination or pan-respiratory VLP vaccines targeting the viral causes of pneumonia in older adults.
Our Early-Stage Programs
 We are exploring several other viral and bacterial pathogens to potentially incorporate into VLP vaccine candidates that may be added to our pipeline. We review technical feasibility, demonstrated market need and potential and clinical program design and timelines with our outside scientific and commercial advisors and board of directors before selecting new vaccine programs for development.
Competition
 Overview
 Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant regulatory and technological change. The current vaccine market is concentrated among a few key global biopharmaceutical companies including GlaxoSmithKline, Merck, Sanofi, Pfizer, Moderna, and CSL Bering, which together account for the majority of vaccine sales globally. Other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions are also active in the vaccine market given the continuing global need for both existing and new vaccines. The large markets for respiratory virus vaccines make them attractive targets for new vaccines and we face competition from numerous vaccine developers. While we believe that our technology, strategy, and our employee and consultant knowledge and experience can provide us with competitive advantages, many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, sales and supply resources or experience than we do.
 The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, reactogenicity, safety, durability, convenience, and price, the number of other vaccines on the market in the specific target indications, the recommendation of vaccines by policy makers, the inclusion of vaccines on the national immunization schedules, and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
 VLP-Based Vaccines
 A number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are developing VLP vaccine candidates. Many of these candidates are enveloped vaccines that require budding from the host cell membrane which can result in inclusion of host cell protein components leading to manufacturing complexities, such as additional purification needs. This includes, but is not limited to, Medicago and VBI Vaccines. Other technologies incorporate the antigen to naturally occurring viral VLP scaffolds which may be less flexible and suitable for presentation of complex antigens; this includes, but is not limited to, SpyBiotech. We believe that our VLP technology allows for incorporation of a broad and complex array of viral antigens and targets as well as ease of manufacturing and scale-up, which may allow us to compete with other VLP vaccine candidates in development.
 RSV and hMPV Vaccines for Older Adults
 There is no vaccine currently approved for prevention of disease due to RSV infections or for prevention of disease due to hMPV infections in any population, including older adults. We are aware of companies currently developing vaccines against RSV for use in older adults, including GlaxoSmithKline, Pfizer, Bavarian Nordic, Janssen, Moderna and Meissa, with several currently in Phase 3 trials. As far as we are aware, no company has a VLP-based RSV vaccine in clinical trials. In addition, as far as we are aware, there are no companies with a vaccine in clinical development against hMPV for use in older adults, nor are there any companies with a vaccine in clinical development against the combination of RSV and hMPV for use in older adults; however, Moderna has an RSV and hMPV combination vaccine in clinical trials for pediatric use and Sanofi has announced that it is exploring RSV monovalent RSV and hMPV combination vaccines for older adults preclinically. We believe the induction of nAbs is key for both RSV and hMPV vaccine efficacy in older adults and that multivalent VLP display of the prefusion RSV and hMPV antigens on our VLP candidates has the potential to induce a stronger nAb response than other vaccine technologies.
 COVID-19 Vaccines
 We expect that, if approved, IVX-411 or any other COVID-19 VLP candidate we develop will compete with any currently approved vaccines against COVID-19. Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech, AstraZeneca, Janssen, and Novavax, along with many other companies, are currently marketing COVID-19 vaccines. Medicago has obtained an approval to market their VLP COVID-19 vaccine in Canada. We are also aware of numerous COVID-19 vaccines in clinical development, including VLP approaches being developed by Bavarian Nordic, SpyBiotech and VBI Vaccines. We believe that our vaccine candidates have the potential to be differentiated or play a potential role in a pan-respiratory candidate.
Combination Vaccines
 We expect increasing numbers of combination and pan-respiratory vaccine candidates. For example, Moderna is developing a COVID-19/influenza/RSV combination vaccine preclinically, and Novavax has a combined COVID-19/influenza combination vaccine in Phase 1 clinical development.
Manufacturing
 

We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any large-scale or current cGMP manufacturing facilities. To date, we have successfully worked in conjunction with our third-party manufacturers to complete development and cGMP manufacturing campaigns for key components, VLP drug substance, and formulated drug product for all of our vaccine candidates. We are working with our existing manufacturers to scale up our manufacturing capabilities to support our clinical plans.
 To date, we do not own or manufacture adjuvants and for vaccine candidates that we move forward as adjuvanted vaccines, we must rely on non-proprietary commercially available adjuvants or access to proprietary adjuvants through license or supply agreements with adjuvant manufacturers.
 We believe our outsourced manufacturing strategy allows us to maintain a more efficient infrastructure by eliminating the need to for us to invest in our own manufacturing facilities, equipment, or personnel. This enables us to focus our time, expertise, and resources on the development of our vaccine candidates.
 Commercialization Plan
 Our current development plans focus on development and regulatory submissions in the United States and Europe. We currently have no sales, marketing, or commercial product distribution capabilities and have no experience as a company commercializing products. We intend to build the necessary infrastructure and capabilities over time for the United States and Europe, and potentially other regions, following further advancement of our product candidates. We may work in partnership with one or more pharmaceutical partners for certain vaccine candidates, for certain patient populations, or for certain geographies where we believe that others’ capabilities and resources may be ideally suited for development, commercialization, or distribution of our vaccine candidates.
Intellectual Property
 We strive to protect the proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business, including seeking and maintaining rights in patents intended to cover our future vaccine candidates and compositions, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture and any other inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business. We seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing or in-licensing U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications related to technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on our agreements with UW for intellectual property rights that are important or necessary for the development of our vaccine candidates. We also rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets and know-how to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection.
 For each vaccine candidate we develop and plan to commercialize, as a normal course of business, we intend to pursue composition and preventative use patents. We also seek patent protection with respect to novel methods of manufacture, formulations, or antigen combinations. We have sought and plan to continue to seek patent protection, either alone or jointly with our collaborators, as our license agreements may dictate.
 Regardless of the coverage we seek under our existing patent applications, there is always a risk that an alteration to the product or process may provide sufficient basis for a competitor to avoid infringement claims. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before a patent is issued and courts can reinterpret patent scope after issuance. Moreover, many jurisdictions, including the United States, permit third parties to challenge issued patents in administrative proceedings, which may result in further narrowing or even cancellation of patent claims. Moreover, we cannot provide any assurance that any patents will be issued from our pending or any future applications or that any current or future issued patents will adequately protect our intellectual property.
 In summary, as of December 31, 2021, our patent estate included three issued patents and 23 non-provisional patent applications with claims directed to our VLP platform and our vaccine candidates. On a worldwide basis, our patent estate for our VLP platforms includes three U.S. patents, with pending continuation applications, and two pending international patent applications; more than 15 patent applications jointly covering our RSV and hMPV products specifically; more than 10 patent applications covering other infectious disease targets; a non-exclusive license from UW to a Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) application covering coronavirus, that will become exclusive in the United States, Canada, Mexico and Europe (including Switzerland and United Kingdom) starting in 2025; and a non-exclusive license from UW to patent applications directed to nanoparticle-based influenza vaccines.
 More specifically, we have exclusively licensed our main VLP icosahedral platform (as well as several alternative platforms) from UW. Two issued U.S. patents that will expire in 2035 and 2036 cover our platform as compositions of matter: polypeptides and the nucleic acids encoding them, respectively.
 

We also have a license from UW to a pending U.S. patent with an expected expiry of 2034 with claims directed to the computational methods used to develop these and other two-component, symmetrical nanoparticles / VLPs. A parent application has already issued as a U.S. patent with an adjusted expiration date in 2036; it claims several tetrahedral nanoparticle / VLP platforms as compositions of matter. These blocking patent rights are joined by an issued U.S. patent and its continuation application, having actual or expected expirations in 2038, that cover various alternative icosahedral nanoparticles. We intend to continue to work with UW on development of further nanoparticle platforms and may have the opportunity to license them as appropriate.
 For our RSV product, composition-of-matter and method-of-use patent rights are provided by a patent family being prosecuted in the United States and Europe, as well as in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Israel, India, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Malaysia, Philippines, Russia, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam and South Africa. Any patents that ultimately issue from this patent family are expected to expire in 2038. UW’s inter-institutional agreements (IIA) with the Institute for Research in Biomedicine in Bellinzona, Switzerland conferred on UW the right to license this patent family to us.
 We have licensed certain patent rights from NIH directed to the antigenic portion of our RSV product for stabilization of the antigen in a prefusion conformation. These patent rights are assigned to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), based on inventions made at the Vaccine Research Center of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). Specifically, we have non-exclusively licensed three issued U.S. patents directed to the compositions of matter, which will expire in 2034. The same license covers one issued U.S. patent directed to compositions of matter covering the antigenic portion of our hMPV candidate, and this patent will expire in 2035. The specific mutations found in our hMPV product are also protected by patent rights based on inventions made at the University of Texas. We have exclusively (for all vaccine fields other than mRNA) licensed one pending PCT patent application directed to composition of matter, national stage entries of which, if issued, will expire in 2041. We further intend to pursue company-owned patent rights on improvements underlying our hMPV product, with such patent rights potentially extending the term of exclusivity until at least 2041.
 HHS and the Institute for Research in Biomedicine in Bellinzona, Switzerland jointly own two U.S. patents on conformationally stabilized hMPV antigens, which we have non-exclusively licensed, subject to an IIA between HHS and the Institute for Research in Biomedicine. These patents expire in 2035. A continuation application and corresponding European patent application are currently pending in this patent family.
 We also have a non-exclusive license from UW to a patent family with claims directed to our coronavirus product candidate (IVX-411), which includes a pending PCT application. This non-exclusive license that will become exclusive in the United States, Canada, Mexico and Europe (including Switzerland and United Kingdom) starting in 2025.
 We have a non-exclusive license from UW and HHS to patents directed to nanoparticle-based influenza virus vaccines. Specifically, we have non-exclusively licensed a patent family being prosecuted in the United States and Europe, as well as in Australia, China, Hong Kong, and South Korea, which is directed to the compositions of matter and methods of use, and which will expire in 2040.
 Further patent protected related to other indications is provided by a family of more than 10 patent applications filed in the United States and foreign jurisdictions, which is also exclusively licensed in relevant fields from UW. Any patents that ultimately issue from this patent family are expected to expire in 2039. Foreign jurisdictions where patent applications are pending include Australia, Canada, China, Colombia, Europe including the United Kingdom, Indonesia, India, South Korea, Russia, Vietnam and South Africa.
 We continue to prepare and file provisional patent applications directed to vaccine composition improvements, manufacturing methods, and formulations, as appropriate.
 For more information regarding our license agreements with UW and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, please see “—Material Agreements.”
 Generally, we submit patent applications directly with the USPTO as provisional patent applications. Provisional applications for patents were designed to provide a lower-cost first patent filing in the United States. Corresponding non-provisional patent applications must be filed not later than 12 months after the provisional application filing date. The corresponding non-provisional application benefits in that the priority date(s) of the patent application is/are the earlier provisional application filing date(s), and the patent term of the finally issued patent is calculated from the later non-provisional application filing date. This system allows us to obtain an early priority date, add material to the patent application(s) during the priority year, obtain a later start to the patent term and to delay prosecution costs, which may be


useful in the event that we decide not to pursue examination in an application. While we intend to timely file non-provisional patent applications relating to our provisional patent applications, we cannot predict whether any such patent applications will result in the issuance of patents that provide us with any competitive advantage.
 We file U.S. non-provisional applications and PCT applications that claim the benefit of the priority date of earlier filed provisional applications, when applicable. The PCT system allows a single application to be filed within 12 months of the original priority date of the patent application and to designate all of the 153 PCT member states in which national patent applications can later be pursued based on the international patent application filed under the PCT. The PCT searching authority performs a patentability search and issues a non-binding patentability opinion which can be used to evaluate the chances of success for the national applications in foreign countries prior to having to incur the filing fees. Although a PCT application does not issue as a patent, it allows the applicant to seek protection in any of the member states through national-phase applications.
 At the end of the period of two and a half years from the first priority date of the patent application, separate patent applications can be pursued in any of the PCT member states either by direct national filing or, in some cases by filing through a regional patent organization, such as the European Patent Organization. The PCT system delays expenses, allows a limited evaluation of the chances of success for national/regional patent applications and enables substantial savings where applications are abandoned within the first two and a half years of filing.
 For all patent applications, we determine claiming strategy on a case-by-case basis. Advice of counsel and our business model and needs are always considered. We file patents containing claims for protection of all useful applications of our proprietary technologies and any products, as well as all new applications and/or uses we discover for existing technologies and products, assuming these are strategically valuable. We continuously reassess the number and type of patent applications, as well as the pending patent claims to ensure that maximum coverage and value are obtained for our processes and compositions, given existing patent office rules and regulations. Further, claims may be modified during patent prosecution to meet our intellectual property and business needs.
 We recognize that the ability to obtain patent protection and the degree of such protection depends on a number of factors, including the extent of the prior art, the novelty and non-obviousness of the invention and the ability to satisfy the enablement requirement of the patent laws. The patent positions of therapeutic companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted or further altered even after patent issuance. Consequently, we may not obtain or maintain adequate patent protection for any of our future product candidates or for our platform technology. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. Any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties.
 In addition to patents, we have filed for trademark registration at the USPTO for “Icosavax” and our company logo. Furthermore, we rely upon trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have confidentiality agreements or invention assignment agreements with our commercial partners and selected consultants. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
 Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. In addition, we have licensed, or expect to be able to license on commercially reasonable terms, rights under proprietary technologies of third parties to develop, manufacture and commercialize specific aspects of our future products and services. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third party patent would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, alter our processes, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. The expiration of patents or patent applications licensed from third parties or our breach of any license agreements or failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights that we may require to develop or commercialize our future technology may have a material adverse impact on us. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference proceedings in the USPTO to determine priority of invention.

 Material Agreements
 Agreements with University of Washington
 License Agreement with respect to RSV and Other Pathogens
 In June 2018, we entered into a license agreement with UW as amended in July 2019 and November 2020 (UW License Agreement). Pursuant to the UW License Agreement, UW granted to us an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing, sublicensable license under certain UW patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import, and otherwise exploit any product covered by the licensed patents, or licensed products, for the prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatment of RSV infection and five other infectious diseases. UW also granted us a non-exclusive license to use certain know-how related to the licensed patents. The licensed patents and know-how generally relate to computationally designed nanoparticles and vaccines based upon such designs, and relate to our proprietary two-component virus-like-particle technology. As of March 2022, the UW License Agreement is applicable to our IVX-121, IVX-241, and IVX-A12 programs.
 The rights granted to us by UW are subject to certain rights of UW, the United States federal government, and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI). UW retained rights under the licensed patents for research and educational purposes and for UW to comply with its obligations under applicable laws for federally funded inventions. The federal government has (i) a worldwide, nonexclusive, nontransferable, irrevocable, paid-up license to the licensed patents, (ii) march-in rights exercisable if public health crises so demand, and (iii) to the extent required by Title 35, Section 204 of the United States Code, a requirement that for any products licensed for use in the United States, that these products be substantially manufactured in the United States, because the inventions covered by the licensed patents arose in whole or in part from federal funding. HHMI has a paid-up, non-exclusive, sublicensable, irrevocable license for research use owing to the involvement of HHMI employees in developing the inventions of the licensed patents. HHMI’s right to sublicense is limited to non-profit and governmental entities.
 Owing to grant funding provided to UW by BMGF in connection with the licensed patents and know-how, UW granted a humanitarian license and made certain global access commitments with respect to the funded developments for three of the six pathogens (excluding RSV and two others) for humanitarian purposes. UW may require us to grant sublicenses to third parties to make such licensed developments available at an affordable price in developing countries, or if we do not offer such sublicenses on reasonable terms, UW may grant such licenses directly to third parties to enable affordable access in developing countries. Currently, our hMPV vaccine program is the only active program subject to this UW humanitarian license to BMGF.
 We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to diligently develop, manufacture, and commercialize vaccines incorporating the licensed products, and to achieve specified development and regulatory milestone events, including, with respect to IVX-121, initiating clinical trials of specified phases by certain dates between 2022 and 2026 and making first commercial sale by a specified date thereafter, and with respect to IVX-241 and IVX-A12, conducting activities necessary to enable clinical trials and initiating clinical trials of specified phases, in each case, by certain specified dates between 2022 and 2028, and making first commercial sale by a specified date thereafter. If we are unable to meet our diligence obligations and cannot agree with UW to modify such obligations or do not cure by meeting such obligations, then UW may terminate the UW License Agreement in whole, or in part on a pathogen-by-pathogen basis.
 In connection with the execution of the UW License Agreement, we issued 192,276 shares of our common stock to UW in August 2018. We are required to pay an annual license maintenance fee in the mid four figures. We are required to pay UW development and regulatory milestone payments up to an aggregate amount of three hundred and fifty thousand dollars for each of the six licensed product candidates. We are also required to pay UW commercial milestone payments of one million dollars for each of the six licensed product candidates upon reaching a certain net sales threshold. We are also required to pay UW a fixed low single digit percentage royalty on net sales of licensed products, subject to certain reductions if we are required to pay for third-party intellectual property rights in order to commercialize the licensed products, and after first commercial sale of a licensed product, we must meet a certain minimum royalty requirement in the low to mid five figures range on an annual basis. If we sublicense our rights under the UW License Agreement, we are obligated to pay UW a mid-single digit to mid-double digit percentage of all sublicensing revenue received, depending on when we grant such sublicenses in relation to the development stage of the licensed product, and adjusted for any development expenses and development or regulatory milestone payments already made.
 

The UW License Agreement will remain in effect until all licensed patent rights have terminated and all obligations due to UW have been fulfilled. The last-to-expire licensed patents, if issued, is expected to expire in 2041, subject to any adjustment or extension of patent term that may be available. UW can terminate the UW License Agreement if we breach or fail to perform one of our material duties under the UW License Agreement and our unable to remedy the default within an agreed upon time period that can be extended by UW. We can terminate the UW License Agreement at will with prior written notice to UW. We can also terminate certain of our licensed rights through an amendment to the UW License Agreement.
 Option and License Agreement with Respect to COVID-19
 In July 2020, we entered into an option and license agreement with UW, as amended in August 2020 and May 2021 (UW Option and License Agreement). Pursuant to the UW Option and License Agreement, UW granted to us a non-exclusive, worldwide (excluding South Korea), sublicensable license under certain UW patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import, or otherwise exploit any product covered under the licensed patents for the prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatments of SARS-CoV-2 infection. UW also granted us a non-exclusive, worldwide license to use certain know-how related to the licensed patents. The licensed patents and know-how generally relate to computationally designed nanoparticles and vaccines based upon such designs, and used in our proprietary two-component virus-like-particle technology. As of March 2022, the UW Option and License Agreement is applicable to our IVX-411 and SARS-CoV-2 variant programs.
 The license included, and we have since exercised, an option to obtain an exclusive license under the UW Option and License Agreement for the United States, Canada, Mexico, and the countries of the European Patent Organization (including Switzerland and the United Kingdom) starting in 2025. There was no option exercise fee. However, the option right is subject to certain rights of the United States federal government, UW, BMGF, and HHMI, as described above in connection with the UW License Agreement.
 We are required to pay UW a low single digit percentage royalty on net sales of licensed products, subject to certain reductions if we are required to pay for third party intellectual property rights in order to commercialize the licensed products. However, we are not required to pay royalties on net sales of any licensed products under the UW Option and License Agreement if we are already required to pay royalties on such net sales under the UW License Agreement on, for example, a combination product.
 Our diligence obligations under the UW Option and License Agreement and the parties’ rights to terminate the UW Option and License Agreement are substantially the same as the analogous obligations and rights under the UW License Agreement. Specifically, with respect to IVX-411, our obligations include initiating clinical trials of specified phases by certain dates between 2022 and 2025 and obtaining regulatory approval by a specified date thereafter. We incorporate the descriptions above regarding termination rights by reference. The last-to-expire relevant patents under the UW Option and License Agreement, if issued, are expected to expire in 2041, subject to any adjustment or extension of patent term that may be available.
 License Agreement with Respect to Influenza
In September 2021, we entered into a license agreement with UW (UW Flu License Agreement). Pursuant to the UW Flu License Agreement, UW granted us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing, sublicensable (subject to certain restrictions) license under certain UW patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import, and otherwise exploit any product covered by the licensed patents (Licensed Flu Products), for the prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatment of influenza. UW also granted us a non-exclusive, worldwide license to use certain know-how related to the licensed patents. The licensed patents and know-how generally relate to computationally designed nanoparticles and vaccines based upon such designs, and relate to our proprietary two-component virus-like-particle technology and nanoparticle-based influenza virus vaccines. As of March 2022, the UW Flu License Agreement is applicable to our preclinical influenza program.
 The United States federal government and HHMI have similar rights under the UW Flu License Agreement and the UW License Agreement described above in “License Agreement with respect to RSV and Other Pathogens”.
We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize Licensed Flu Products, and to initiate a clinical trial with respect to such Licensed Flu Products by a specified date in 2025. If we are unable to initiate a clinical trial by the specified date and cannot agree with UW to modify such obligation or do not cure by meeting such obligation,


then UW may terminate the UW Flu License Agreement.
Under the UW Flu License Agreement, we paid UW a one-time upfront license fee, and after September 2023 and for the remainder of the term of the UW Flu License Agreement, we are required to pay tiered minimum annual fees ranging from the mid four figures to the mid five figures, with such fees creditable against royalty payments. We are required to pay UW up to an aggregate of $350 thousand for payments related to development milestones and up to an aggregate of $6 million for payments related to commercial milestones based upon reaching certain cumulative net sales thresholds for all Licensed Flu Products. We are also required to pay UW a fixed low single digit percentage royalty on net sales of Licensed Flu Products by us and our sublicensees, subject to certain reductions if we are required to pay for third-party intellectual property rights in order to commercialize the Licensed Flu Products. We are not obligated to pay duplicate royalties on net sales of any Licensed Flu Products if we are already required to pay a royalty on such net sales under the UW License Agreement or the UW Option and License Agreement.
 The UW Flu License Agreement will remain in effect until all licensed patent rights have terminated and all obligations due to UW have been fulfilled. The last-to-expire licensed patent, if issued, is expected to expire in 2041, subject to any adjustment or extension of patent term that may be available. UW can terminate the UW Flu License Agreement if we breach or fail to perform one of our material duties under the UW Flu License Agreement and are unable to remedy the default within an agreed upon time period that can be extended by UW. We can terminate the UW Flu License Agreement at will with prior written notice to UW. We can also terminate certain of our licensed rights through an amendment to the UW Flu License Agreement.
NIH Patent License Agreement
 On June 28, 2018, we and the NIAID of the NIH entered into a non-exclusive license agreement for certain intellectual property rights and biological materials, as amended on September 10, 2018 and September 9, 2020 (NIH Agreement). Pursuant to the NIH Agreement, NIAID granted us a worldwide, nonexclusive, sublicensable license to certain patent rights, data, information, and materials directed to immunogens and antibodies and components and processes thereof relating to RSV and hMPV to allow us to make, use, sell, offer to sell, and import adjuvanted or non-adjuvanted vaccines that combine technology covered by the licensed patent rights with our proprietary protein-based nanoparticle technology, for the prevention, cure, amelioration or treatment of RSV and hMPV infections in humans, for administration alone or in combination with one or more other vaccines, and specifically excluding nucleic acid-based vaccines. NIAID also transferred to us certain biological materials relating to the foregoing for our development purposes. As of March 2022, the NIH Agreement is applicable to our IVX-121, IVX-241, and IVX-A12 programs.
 Pursuant to the NIH agreement, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop the licensed products using the licensed processes to make the licensed products available to the United States public on reasonable terms, including by adhering to a commercial development plan and meeting specified benchmarks with regards to specified deadlines for regulatory filings, initiation of clinical trials, and gaining regulatory approval for the licensed products, in each case by certain specified dates between 2022 and 2032. To the extent required by Title 35, Section 204 of the United States Code, we agreed to manufacture substantially in the United States all licensed products that are to be used or sold in the United States, to make reasonable quantities of the licensed product, if commercialized, available to patient assistance programs in the United States, to develop educational materials relating to the licensed product, and to supply reasonable quantities of the licensed products made by the licensed processes to NIAID for research, education and display purposes.
 In consideration of the rights granted under the NIH Agreement, we paid NIAID a one-time upfront payment in the low six figures and amendment issue fees in the high five figures. We are required to make tiered, low single-digit percentage royalty payments on specified portions of annual net sales of licensed products outside of least developed countries, subject to certain specified reductions if we are required to pay royalties to third parties in order to commercialize the license products. We are required to make aggregate development and regulatory milestone payments of up to $1.15 million for the approval of the first indication for a licensed product, up to $650,000 for the approval of the second indication for a licensed product, up to $375,000 for the approval of the third indication for a licensed product, and $50,000 for each subsequent indication. We are further required to make sales milestone payments upon achieving certain aggregate net sales thresholds for all licensed products of up to $6.5 million in aggregate. We are also required to pay NIAID a mid-single to low double-digit percentage of any sublicensing revenue we receive, depending on when we grant such sublicense in relation to the development stage of the licensed product and the number of indications that we


sublicense. Additionally, our payment obligations to NIAID are subject to annual minimums ranging from low-mid five figures to low six figures depending on the year and commercialization stage.
 The NIH Agreement will expire upon the expiration of the last-to-expire licensed patent. NIAID may terminate the agreement for our uncured material breach, our insolvency or bankruptcy. Further, NIAID has the right to terminate or modify the NIH Agreement if (i) we do not execute the commercial development plan, (ii) we do not take effective steps to develop the licensed products to make them available for the public on reasonable terms, (iii) we do not achieve specified benchmarks, (iv) we do not keep at least one licensed product or process available to the public after commercial use commences, (v) to the extent required to do so under Title 35, Section 204 of the United States Code, (vi) we do not receive a U.S. manufacturing waiver from NIAID, NIH and do not justify a failure to manufacture the licensed products substantially in the United States, if intending to use in the United States (vii) we do not reasonably satisfy the public use requirements specified under federal regulations, or (viii) we willfully make a false statement to or omit a material fact from NIAID in connection with the license application and progress reports. We have the unilateral right to terminate the NIH Agreement in its entirety or in any country with prior written notice to NIAID.
 Patent License Agreement with the University of Texas at Austin
 In June 2021, we entered into a patent license agreement (the UT License Agreement) with the University of Texas at Austin (UT). Pursuant to the UT License Agreement, we received an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license, under certain UT patent rights and know-how relating to human metapneumovirus (hMPV) antigen to manufacture, develop, use, sell, import, and otherwise exploit all vaccines covered by such patents or incorporating such know-how, except for mRNA-based vaccines. Our rights and obligations under the UT License Agreement, are subject to certain U.S. government rights and UT’s retained rights under the licensed patent rights for academic or non-commercial publication, manufacture, and use, including sublicensable rights to academic and non-profit institutions. As of March 2022, the UT License Agreement is applicable to our IVX-241 and IVX-A12 programs.
 Under the UT License Agreement, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to meet certain specified development, sales and regulatory milestones related to the licensed products, including maintaining a reasonably funded active research, development, manufacturing, regulatory, marketing or sales program, as applicable and necessary to commercialize the licensed products, and in each case by certain specified dates between 2021 and 2030. In consideration for the rights granted to us under the UT License Agreement, we are required to pay UT an annual license fee, escalating from low to mid five figures dollars, until the first sale of a licensed product. There are milestone payments due upon the completion of certain development, regulatory, and commercial milestones for a licensed product in the future, with potential payments for such future development, regulatory, and sales-based milestones in the aggregate in the mid-single figure million dollars. Additionally, we have agreed to pay UT low single-digit percentage royalties on net sales of all licensed products, with a reduced royalty rate if the licensed product expresses more than one unique antigen or if we are required to pay royalties to a third party for rights to such third party’s intellectual property in order to commercialize the licensed product. Our royalty payment obligations are subject to specified minimums in the mid-five to low-six figure dollars that are creditable to royalties owed. If we sublicense our rights under the UT License Agreement, we are obligated to pay UT a mid-single digit to low-mid-double digit percentage of all non-royalty sublicensing revenue received, depending on when we grant such sublicenses in relation to the development stage of the licensed product. We are also required to pay UT low six figure dollars if we assign the UT License Agreement to a third party.
 The UT License Agreement will continue until the expiration of the last-to-expire licensed patent. We have the right to terminate the UT License Agreement by providing UT with prior written notice. UT may terminate the UT License Agreement in its entirety, or partially terminate the licensed patent rights, narrow the vaccine field, reduce the territory, or convert the license from exclusive to non-exclusive if we: (i) fail to meet our payment obligations, (ii) commit an uncured breach, (iii) commit three or more cured breaches within a specified time period, (iv) challenge the validity, enforceability, or scope of the licensed patent rights, or (v) undergo certain insolvency-related events.
 Agreements with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation
 On September 24, 2020, we entered into a grant agreement (the Grant Agreement) with BMGF relating to our development of a COVID-19 vaccine. Under the Grant Agreement, BMGF provided funding to us to (i) assemble select components into a COVID-19 vaccine for pandemic use (the COVID-19 vaccine) and perform related product fill and finish, (ii) develop regulatory submission-enabling data regarding the COVID-19 vaccine, and (iii) conduct a Phase 1 clinical trial to assess safety and immunogenicity of the COVID-19 vaccine in healthy adults and older adults, which we refer to collectively as the Funded Developments. Pursuant to the Grant Agreement, we granted BMGF a nonexclusive, perpetual, royalty-free, fully paid up, sublicensable humanitarian license to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import, distribute, or otherwise exploit the Funded Developments to provide people most in need within developing countries with access at


an affordable price to the Funded Developments and to support the U.S. educational system and public libraries. We and BMGF may agree to modify or terminate the humanitarian license if we can demonstrate to BMGF’s satisfaction that global access can be best achieved with modifications or termination of the humanitarian license.
 In connection with the Grant Agreement, we entered into a Global Access and Price Commitment Agreement (the GACA) with BMGF on February 17, 2021, which is incorporated into the Grant Agreement. Under the GACA, we agreed to certain global access and price commitments regarding the COVID-19 vaccine we develop with the funding under the Grant Agreement. In addition, we are required to use reasonable and diligent steps to publish results of the project in one or more peer reviewed journals or in a form available to the interested public. In the event we successfully complete any Phase 1 clinical trials, we are obligated to take reasonable steps to continue further development, manufacture, and/or distribution of such COVID-19 vaccine. If development and commercialization continue beyond the Phase 1 trials, we will be required to pursue regulatory approvals and WHO prequalification of such COVID-19 vaccine. We also committed to price such COVID-19 vaccine no higher than a certain percentage rate above the cost of goods sold when selling such COVID-19 vaccine to public sector purchasers for use in select Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI)-eligible and low to low-middle income countries. For a period commencing with the first supply of such COVID-19 vaccine to a public sector purchaser, we will also ensure annual volume commitments of such COVID-19 vaccine to these countries at a mutually agreed upon percentage of our total annual doses.
 In the event we fulfill all the global access commitments and if through no fault of ours or our manufacturing or commercial partner(s) there is insufficient demand to sell an agreed upon percentage of our total doses of such COVID-19 vaccine, then the price and volume commitments will terminate beginning with the next annual period and we will be required to meet with BMGF for good faith discussions regarding the remaining annual periods. Conversely, if demand outstrips our supply capacities, then we will be required to have good faith discussions with BMGF about increased funding to meet the demand. If no agreement is reached, we will be required to provide adequate technology transfer and a non-exclusive license to BMGF to the Funded Developments and our background technology to allow for continued use of such COVID-19 vaccine in such eligible countries for charitable purposes.
 If we are unable to continue development past Phase 1 trials, if requested by BMGF, we will be required to cooperate in good faith in making such Funded Developments and our background technology available to BMGF, assign an accompanying supply agreement to BMGF, and provide adequate technology transfer to continue development of such COVID-19 vaccine and enable its use in such eligible countries for charitable purposes.
 The Grant Agreement will expire on March 31, 2022 unless terminated earlier by BMGF. BMGF can terminate the Grant Agreement, or suspend, discontinue, or modify the grant payments if (i) BMGF is not reasonably satisfied with our progress on the funded project, (ii) there are significant changes to our leadership or other factors that BMGF believes may threaten the funded project’s success, (iii) we undergo a change of control, (vi) there is a change to our tax status, or (v) we fail to comply with the terms of the Grant Agreement.
 Government Regulation and Product Approval
 The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state, and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring, and post-approval reporting of biologics such as those we are developing. We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
U.S. Biologics Regulation
 In the United States, biological products, or biologics, such as vaccines are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act, and other federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations. The process required by the FDA before biologics may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 ▪completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s GLPs;
 ▪submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin;
 ▪approval by an institutional review board (IRB) or ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial is commenced;
 

▪performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic product candidate for its intended use;
 ▪preparation of and submission to the FDA of a biologics license application (BLA), after completion of all pivotal clinical trials and other necessary studies;
 ▪satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable;
 ▪a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review;
 ▪satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s continued safety, purity and potency, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with Good Clinical Practices (GCPs); and
 ▪FDA review and approval of the BLA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States.
 Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate in the United States, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical trials. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the protocol for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site, and must monitor the study until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board, which provides authorization for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and clinical study results to public registries, including clinicaltrials.gov.
 For purposes of BLA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
 ▪Phase 1—The investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
 ▪Phase 2—The investigational product is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
 ▪Phase 3—The investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy or equivalent agreed endpoints and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
 

In some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. These so-called Phase 4 studies may also be made a condition to approval of the BLA. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the biological characteristics of the product candidate, and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 BLA Submission and Review by the FDA
 Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The BLA must include all relevant data available from preclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of the product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by independent investigators. The submission of a BLA requires payment of a substantial application user fee to the FDA, unless a waiver or exemption applies.
 Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the FDA accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. Once a BLA has been accepted for filing, the FDA’s goal is to review standard applications within ten months after the filing date, or, if the application qualifies for priority review, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. In both standard and priority reviews, the review process may also be extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency. The FDA may also convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP.
 After the FDA evaluates a BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter (CRL). An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A CRL will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the BLA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the CRL without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots, and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the CRL, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the BLA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.
 If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy implemented to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a product and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further


assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies.
 Expedited Development and Review Programs
 The FDA offers a number of expedited development and review programs for qualifying product candidates. For example, the fast track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing product candidates that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a fast track product candidate has opportunities for more frequent interactions with the applicable FDA review team during product development and, once a BLA is submitted, the product candidate may be eligible for priority review. A fast track product candidate may also be eligible for rolling review, where the FDA may consider for review sections of the BLA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the BLA.
 A product candidate intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for breakthrough therapy designation to expedite its development and review. A product candidate can receive breakthrough therapy designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the fast track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1 and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product candidate, including involvement of senior managers.
 Any marketing application for a drug or biologic submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product candidate with a fast track designation and/or breakthrough therapy designation, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite the FDA review and approval process, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A BLA is eligible for priority review if the product candidate is designed to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness compared to available alternatives for such disease or condition. For original BLAs, priority review designation means the FDA’s goal is to take action on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date (as compared to ten months under standard review).
 Additionally, product candidates studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive accelerated approval upon a determination that the product candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA will generally require the sponsor to perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. Products receiving accelerated approval may be subject to expedited withdrawal procedures if the sponsor fails to conduct the required post-marketing studies or if such studies fail to verify the predicted clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.
 Fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review, and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.
 Emergency Use Authorization
 The Commissioner of the FDA, under delegated authority from the Secretary of HHS may, under certain circumstances in connection with a declared public health emergency, allow for the marketing of a product that does not otherwise comply with FDA regulations by issuing an EUA for such product. Before an EUA may be issued by HHS, the Secretary must declare an emergency based a determination that public health emergency exists that affects or has the significant potential to affect, national security, and that involves a specified biological, chemical, radiological, or nuclear agent or agents (CBRN), or a specified disease or condition that may be attributable to such CBRN. On February 4, 2020, the HHS Secretary determined that there was such a public health emergency that involves the virus now known as


SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the COVID-19 infection. Once the determination of the threat or emergency has been made, the Secretary of HHS must then declare that an emergency exists justifying the issuance of EUAs for certain types of products (referred to as EUA declarations). On March 27, 2020, the Secretary of HHS declared – on the basis of his determination of a public health emergency that had the potential to affect national security or the health and security of U.S. citizens living abroad that involves SARS-CoV-2 – that circumstances exist justifying authorization of drugs and biologics during the COVID-19 pandemic, subject to the terms of any EUA that is issued.
 Once an EUA declaration has been issued, the FDA can issue EUAs for products that fall within the scope of that declaration. To issue an EUA, the FDA Commissioner must conclude that (1) the CBRN that is referred to in the EUA declaration can cause serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions; (2) based on the totality of scientific evidence available, it is reasonable to believe that the product may be effective in diagnosing, treating, or preventing the disease or condition attributable to the CBRN and that the product’s known and potential benefits outweigh its known and potential risks; and (3) there is no adequate, approved, and available alternative to the product. Products subject to an EUA must still comply with the conditions of the EUA, including labeling and marketing requirements. Moreover, the authorization to market products under an EUA is limited to the period of time the EUA declaration is in effect, and the FDA can revoke an EUA in certain circumstances.
 U.S. Post-Approval Requirements
 Biologics are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program fees for any marketed products. Biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements up. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
 The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 ▪restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
 ▪fines, warning letters, or untitled letters;
 ▪clinical holds on clinical trials;
 ▪refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
 ▪product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
 ▪consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal healthcare programs;
 ▪mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information;
 ▪the issuance of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases and other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product; or
 ▪injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
 The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of biologics. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the


best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products.
 Biosimilars and Reference Product Exclusivity
 The Affordable Care Act, signed into law in 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining an approach to review and approval of biosimilars.
 Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic.
 Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the licensure of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that applicant’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of its product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law.
 A biological product can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study.
 Other U.S. Regulatory Requirements
 In addition to FDA regulation of pharmaceutical products, pharmaceutical companies are also subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business and may constrain the financial arrangements and relationships through which we research, as well as sell, market and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing authorization. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, data privacy and security, and transparency laws and regulations related to drug pricing and payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and other healthcare providers. If their operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply, they may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment.
Coverage and Reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidate for which we may seek regulatory approval. Sales in the United States will depend, in part, on the availability of sufficient coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, which include government health programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE and the Veterans Administration, as well as managed care organizations and private health insurers. Prices at which we or our customers seek reimbursement for our product candidates can be subject to challenge, reduction or denial by third-party payors.
 Certain ACA marketplace and other private payor plans are required to include coverage for certain preventative services, including vaccinations recommended by the ACIP without cost share obligations (i.e., co-payments, deductibles or co-insurance) for plan members. Children through 18 years of age without other health insurance coverage may be eligible to receive such vaccinations free-of-charge through the CDC’s Vaccines for Children program. For Medicare beneficiaries, vaccines may be covered under either the Part B program or Part D depending on several criteria, including


the type of vaccine and the beneficiary’s coverage eligibility. If our vaccine candidates, once approved, are covered only under the Part D program, physicians may be less willing to use our products because of the claims adjudication costs and time related to the claims adjudication process and collection of co-payments associated with the Part D program.
 The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product is typically separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. In the United States, there is no uniform policy among payors for coverage or reimbursement. Decisions regarding whether to cover any of a product, the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage and reimbursement policies, but also have their own methods and approval processes. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that can require manufacturers to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of a product to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance.
 Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. Third-party payors may not consider our product candidates to be medically necessary or cost-effective compared to other available therapies. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product that receives approval.
 In some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a product candidate must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing product pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, in the European Union (EU) pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceutical products are regulated at a national level under the individual EU member states’ social security systems. Some foreign countries provide options to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and can control the prices and reimbursement levels of medicinal products for human use. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. A country may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our product candidates. Even if approved for reimbursement, historically, product candidates launched in some foreign countries, such as some countries in the EU, do not follow price structures of the United States and prices generally tend to be significantly lower.
 Healthcare Reform
 In the United States, there have been, and continue to be, legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, and affect the profitable sale of product candidates, and similar healthcare laws and regulations exist in the EU and other jurisdictions. Among policy makers and payors in the United States, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.
 By way of example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the ACA) was passed, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly affected the pharmaceutical industry. The ACA, among other things, increased the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1% of the average manufacturer price; required collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations; required manufacturers to participate in a coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; imposed a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell certain “branded prescription drugs” to specified federal government programs; implemented a new methodology by which the average manufacturer price under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program is calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected; expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs; creates a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and established a Center for Medicare Innovation at the


CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.
 Since its enactment, there have been judicial, executive and political challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and on June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision, President Biden had issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA.
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through July 1, 2022 (with a 1% payment reduction from April 1 to June 30, 2022), unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
 Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. For example, the Build Back Better Act, if enacted, would introduce substantial drug pricing reforms, including the establishment of a drug price negotiation program within the United States Department of Health and Human Services that would require manufacturers to charge a negotiated “maximum fair price” for certain selected drugs or pay an excise tax for noncompliance, and the establishment of rebate payment requirements on manufacturers under Medicare Parts B and D. If the Build Back Better Act is not enacted, similar or other drug pricing proposals could appear in future legislation.
 Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access, marketing cost disclosure and other transparency measures, and, in some cases, measures designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine which drugs and suppliers will be included in their healthcare programs Furthermore, there has been increased interest by third party payors and governmental authorities in reference pricing systems and publication of discounts and list prices.
 Foreign Regulation
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries.
 Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product candidate, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product candidates in those countries. The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. Failure to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
 Preclinical Studies and Clinical Trials
 Similar to the United States, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the EU are subject to significant regulatory controls.
 

Preclinical studies are performed to demonstrate the health or environmental safety of new chemical or biological substances. Preclinical studies must be conducted in compliance with the principles of good laboratory practice (GLP) as set forth in EU Directive 2004/10/EC. In particular, preclinical studies, both in vitro and in vivo, must be planned, performed, monitored, recorded, reported and archived in accordance with the GLP principles, which define a set of rules and criteria for a quality system for the organizational process and the conditions for preclinical studies. These GLP standards reflect the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development requirements.
 Clinical trials of medicinal products in the EU must be conducted in accordance with EU and national regulations and the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH), guidelines on good clinical practices (GCP) as well as the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. If the sponsor of the clinical trial is not established within the EU, it must appoint an EU entity to act as its legal representative. The sponsor must take out a clinical trial insurance policy, and in most EU countries, the sponsor is liable to provide ‘no fault’ compensation to any study subject injured in the clinical trial.
 Certain countries and jurisdictions outside of the United States, including the EU, have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical study application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. A CTA must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and the IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved by the national health authority and the ethics committee has granted a positive opinion in relation to the conduct of the trial in the relevant member state(s), in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical study development may proceed.
 The CTA must include, among other things, a copy of the trial protocol and an investigational medicinal product dossier containing information about the manufacture and quality of the medicinal product under investigation. Currently, CTAs must be submitted to the competent authority in each EU member state in which the trial will be conducted. Under the new Regulation on Clinical Trials, which became applicable in January 2022, there is a centralized application procedure where one national authority takes the lead in reviewing the application and the other national authorities have only limited involvement. Any substantial changes to the trial protocol or other information submitted with the CTA must be notified to or approved by the relevant competent authorities and ethics committees. Medicines used in clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with good manufacturing practice (GMP). Other national and EU-wide regulatory requirements may also apply.
 Marketing Authorizations
 In the EU, medicinal products can only be placed on the market after obtaining a marketing authorization (MA). To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational biological product under EU regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application (MAA). The application used to file the BLA in the United States is similar to that required in the EU, with the exception of, among other things, country specific document requirements. The process for doing this depends, among other things, on the nature of the medicinal product.
 The centralized procedure results in a single MA, issued by the European Commission, based on the opinion of the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP) which is valid across the entire territory of the EU. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human medicines that are: (i) derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering, (ii) contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases, (iii) designated orphan medicines and (iv) ATMPs, such as gene therapy, somatic cell therapy or tissue-engineered medicines. The centralized procedure may at the request of the applicant also be used in certain other cases.
 National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the EU member states and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in an EU member state, this national MA can be recognized in another member state through the mutual recognition procedure. If the product has not received a national MA in any member state at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various member states through the decentralized procedure. Under the decentralized procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the national competent authority of each of the member states in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference member state.
 Under the centralized procedure, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a MAA by the EMA is 210 days. In exceptional cases, the CHMP might perform an accelerated review of a MAA in no more than 150 days (not including clock stops). Innovative products that target an unmet medical need and are expected to be of major public health interest


may be eligible for a number of expedited development and review programs, such as the PRIME scheme, which provides incentives similar to the breakthrough therapy designation in the U.S. PRIME is a voluntary scheme aimed at enhancing the EMA’s support for the development of medicines that target unmet medical needs. It is based on increased interaction and early dialogue with companies developing promising medicines, to optimize their product development plans and speed up their evaluation to help them reach patients earlier. Product developers that benefit from PRIME designation can expect to be eligible for accelerated assessment but this is not guaranteed. The benefits of a PRIME designation include the appointment of a CHMP rapporteur before submission of a MAA, early dialogue and scientific advice at key development milestones, and the potential to qualify products for accelerated review earlier in the application process. Innovative medicines fulfilling a medical need may also benefit from different types of fast track approvals, such as a conditional MA or a MA under exceptional circumstances granted on the basis of less comprehensive clinical data than normally required (respectively in the likelihood that the sponsor will provide such data within an agreed timeframe or when comprehensive data cannot be obtained even after authorization).
 Classical MAs have an initial duration of five years. After these five years, the authorization may be renewed for an unlimited period on the basis of a reevaluation of the risk-benefit balance.
 Data and Marketing Exclusivity
 The EU also provides opportunities for market exclusivity. For example, in the EU, upon receiving MA, new chemical entities generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. If granted, data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the EU from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic or biosimilar application. During the additional two year period of market exclusivity, a generic/biosimilar MA can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic/biosimilar product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. The overall ten-year market exclusivity period may be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years a new therapeutic indication with significant clinical benefit over existing therapies is approved. However, there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the EU’s regulatory authorities to be a new chemical entity, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity.
 There is a special regime for biosimilars, or biological medicinal products that are similar to a reference medicinal product but that do not meet the definition of a generic medicinal product, for example, because of differences in raw materials or manufacturing processes. For such products, the results of appropriate preclinical or clinical trials must be provided, and guidelines from the EMA detail the type of quantity of supplementary data to be provided for different types of biological product. There are no such guidelines for complex biological products, such as gene or cell therapy medicinal products, and so it is unlikely that biosimilars of those products will currently be approved in the EU. However, guidance from the EMA states that they will be considered in the future in light of the scientific knowledge and regulatory experience gained at the time.
 Foreign Post-Approval Requirements
 Similar to the United States, both MA holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA, the European Commission and/or the competent regulatory authorities of the member states. The holder of a MA must establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system and appoint an individual qualified person for pharmacovigilance who is responsible for oversight of that system. Key obligations include expedited reporting of suspected serious adverse reactions and submission of periodic safety update reports (PSURs).
 All new MAA must include a risk management plan (RMP) describing the risk management system that the company will put in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the MA. Such risk-minimization measures or post-authorization obligations may include additional safety monitoring, more frequent submission of PSURs, or the conduct of additional clinical trials or post-authorization safety studies.
 The advertising and promotion of medicinal products is also subject to laws concerning promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. All advertising and promotional activities for the product must be consistent with the approved summary of product characteristics, and therefore all off-label promotion is prohibited. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines is also prohibited in the EU. Although general requirements for advertising and promotion of medicinal products are established under EU directives, the details are governed by regulations in each member state and can differ from one country to another.
 

The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the European Economic Area (EEA) which consists of the 27 EU member states plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.
 Failure to comply with EU and member state laws that apply to the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing approval, MA of medicinal products and marketing of such products, both before and after grant of the MA, manufacturing of pharmaceutical products, statutory health insurance, bribery and anti-corruption or with other applicable regulatory requirements may result in administrative, civil or criminal penalties. These penalties could include delays or refusal to authorize the conduct of clinical trials, or to grant MA, product withdrawals and recalls, product seizures, suspension, withdrawal or variation of the MA, total or partial suspension of production, distribution, manufacturing or clinical trials, operating restrictions, injunctions, suspension of licenses, fines and criminal penalties.
 Privacy and Data Protection Laws
 Numerous state, federal and foreign laws, regulations and standards govern the collection, use, access to, confidentiality and security of health-related and other personal information, and could apply now or in the future to our operations or the operations of our partners. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information privacy and security laws and consumer protection laws and regulations govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. In addition, certain foreign laws govern the privacy and security of personal data, including health-related data. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) imposes strict requirements for processing the personal data of individuals within the EEA. Companies that must comply with the GDPR face increased compliance obligations and risk, including more robust regulatory enforcement of data protection requirements and potential fines for noncompliance of up to €20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. Further, from January 1, 2021, companies have had to comply with the GDPR and also the United Kingdom GDPR (UK GDPR), which, together with the amended UK Data Protection Act 2018, retains the GDPR in UK national law. The UK GDPR mirrors the fines under the GDPR, i.e., fines up to the greater of €20 million (£17.5 million) or 4% of global turnover. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing.
Human Capital
 As of December 31, 2021, we had 34 full-time employees and no part-time employees. Of these employees, 12 hold Ph.D. or M.D. degrees and 24 are engaged in research and development. Twenty-three of our employees are located in Seattle, Washington and the remainder are located in the United States and work remotely. Our employees are not represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
