Our Business
Our Mission.  Diversey’s mission is to protect and care for people through leading hygiene, infection prevention and cleaning solutions. We develop and deliver innovative, mission-critical products, services and technologies that save lives and protect our environment.
Our Foundation. Over the course of 99 years, the Diversey brand has become synonymous with product quality, service and innovation. Our fully-integrated suite of solutions combines patented chemicals, dosing and dispensing equipment, cleaning machines, services and digital analysis and serves more than 85,000 customers in over 80 countries via our vast network of approximately 8,700 employees globally. We are the leading global pure play provider to the approximately $32 billion cleaning and hygiene industry for the Institutional and Food & Beverage markets, where we hold the first or second position in the key markets in which we operate. We are also one of only two large, global players able to serve global strategic accounts (“GSAs”). We consider our scale to be a distinct competitive advantage given the fragmentation of our industry, and our customer relationships are deep and longstanding, resulting in highly recurring revenue streams.
Our Value Proposition.  We are a trusted partner to our customers in delivery of hygiene, infection prevention, and cleaning solutions that provide peace of mind and help our customers maintain their brand integrity and grow their businesses. Through our end-to-end, repeatable services, we focus on achieving the following outcomes for our customers:
• Improved hygiene, infection prevention and cleaning results
• Improved operational efficiency and environmental sustainability
• Reduced costs
• High consistency and high standards across customer locations and geographies
Our customer engagement model drives a virtuous circle of customer acquisition, service expansion, and long-term retention that enables our history of strong growth and resiliency. Through our customer engagement model we strive to:
• Understand Customer Needs and Goals. We partner with customers to determine what matters most to them, with a focus on outcomes rather than specific products.
• Design Custom Solutions.  We then design custom solutions, leveraging our more than 1,400 patents and patent applications from our library of more than 2,000 unique chemical formulations as well as our extensive and differentiated suite of dosing and dispensing equipment and floor care machines.
• Integrate Solutions with Customer Workflows. We train our customers’ end users on how to operate the products and equipment that make up our customized solutions, with a specific focus on health and safety considerations, sustainability, and service requirements.
• Optimize Performance.  After implementation, we remain engaged with our customers on a regular basis and leverage our digital monitoring capabilities to ensure their equipment is operating properly, the workforce is fully trained, and solutions are optimized.
• Expand the Value Proposition. As we continue to engage with our customers, we continually review our performance, compare ourselves against benchmarks, and work to identify ways to expand or enhance our services through new products and innovation, creating ‘win-win’ solutions for us and our customers, and further solidifying our partnership.

Initial Public Offering. On March 29, 2021, we completed an initial public offering of 46,153,846 Ordinary Shares at a public offering price of $15.00 per Ordinary Share, receiving $654.3 million in net proceeds, after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses (the "IPO"). On April 9, 2021, we issued and sold an additional 5,000,000 Ordinary Shares pursuant to the underwriters' partial exercise of their option to purchase additional shares, receiving an incremental $71.4 million in net proceeds, after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expense. Our Ordinary Shares trade on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol "DSEY".
On November 15, 2021, we issued and sold 15,000,000 Ordinary Shares at a public offering price of $15.00 per Ordinary Share, receiving $214.4 million in net proceeds, after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses.
Prior to the formation of Diversey Holdings, Ltd., the organizational structure consisted of Constellation (BC) 2 S.à r.l ("Constellation"), which was incorporated on June 30, 2017, and organized under the laws of Luxembourg as a Société à Responsabilité Limitée for an unlimited period under the direction of Bain Capital, LP (“Bain Capital”). Diamond (BC) B.V., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Constellation, was formed on March 15, 2017 for the purpose of consummating the acquisition of the Diversey Care division and the food hygiene and cleaning business of Sealed Air Corporation (“Sealed Air”) (together, the “Diversey Business”), including certain assets and all the capital stock of certain entities engaged in the Diversey Business (the “Diversey Acquisition”), which acquisition closed on September 6, 2017. 
 Our Business Segments
We report our results of operations in two segments: Institutional and Food & Beverage. 
Institutional Segment
We hold leading market positions in our regional core markets and believe we held the number one or number two market position in North America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region based on net sales for 2021. Our Institutional segment generated $1,918.4 million in net sales and $319.8 million in Adjusted EBITDA, which implies 16.7% margins for the year ended December 31, 2021.

Food & Beverage Segment
We believe we held the number one or number two market position in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region based on net sales for 2021. On December 3, 2021, we acquired Birko Corporation, a North American manufacturer of food safety chemical solutions for the Food & Beverage segment, and Chad Equipment LLC, a subsidiary of Birko Corporation, which manufactures food safety equipment for the Protein industries. This acquisition strengthens our market presence in the United States and Canada, enhances our scale, service and product offering, and creates numerous cross-sell and revenue opportunities as a truly global provider in the food and beverage industries. We believe this acquisition elevates us to the number one or number two market position in North America. Our Food & Beverage segment generated $700.5 million in net sales and $133.7 million in Adjusted EBITDA, which implies 19.1% Adjusted EBITDA margins for the year ended December 31, 2021.
Our Food & Beverage products are designed to maximize the hygiene, safety, and efficiency of our customers’ production and cleaning processes while minimizing their impact on the natural resources they consume. We offer a broad range of products, solutions, equipment and machines including chemical products, engineering and equipment solutions, knowledge-based services, training through our Diversey Hygiene Academy, and water treatment. We deliver these solutions to enhance food safety, operational excellence, and sustainability for customers in the Brewing, Beverage, Dairy, Processed Foods, Pharma, and Agriculture industries.
Our Food & Beverage segment's revenue base is also recurring and stable. Our Cleaning-In-Place (“CIP”) and Open Plant Systems integrate our chemicals, lubricants, floor care equipment, and cleaning and dispensing tools, while our highly skilled technical application experts help customers achieve production efficiencies through customized solutions that utilize our products. The highly integrated and customized nature of the resulting solutions drive operational efficiencies as well as high switching costs for our customers, leading to very high customer retention. The recent addition of water treatment solutions to our Food & Beverage segment also fulfills a longstanding customer need for a bundled solution and offers future opportunities for cross-selling.

Key Food & Beverage products and services include:

Many of our products rely on Diversey-owned proprietary chemistry formulas and patented dosing and dispensing equipment such as the Deosan® Dairy Farming.
Our Sustainability Strategy
Protect. Care. Sustain. This will guide our environmental, social and governance ("ESG") priorities and actions. ESG is core to how we create value and drive growth. The strategy is supported by both 2030 goals and near-term targets which will further reduce our environmental footprint, address social inequality and deliver solutions to help our customers reach their own sustainability goals.
Our strategy builds upon Diversey’s longstanding sustainability mission:
We protect our planet and conserve natural resources. We care about our people, our partnerships, and our customers and are committed to address critical social challenges and reduce risk in our operations. We work tirelessly to sustain the highest standards in responsible business practices and transparency.
In the development of all products and services, we adhere to a green cleaning philosophy. This is defined as the use of cleaning products, equipment and methods that protect the health of building occupants, lower the total cost of cleaning and prevent environmental impacts. Green cleaning also considers chemicals’ and materials’ end of life to ensure that their disposal does not harm the environment. This ensures that all Diversey products and services are designed to enhance not only cleanliness and efficiency, but also safety and environmental sustainability for our 
customers and communities. In 2021, we also made additional investments to expand our product, services, and capabilities.
Hundreds of Diversey products are third-party certified, verifying that they meet the highest health, safety and sustainability standards. Among the certifications that our products feature:
• Cradle-to-Cradle
• EPA (Safer Choice)
• EU Ecolabel
• Green Seal
• Nordic Swan
• UL Environment: ECOLOGO, GREENGUARD
Sustainability is core to the value proposition we provide our customers. We partner with our customers to design solutions that enable them to meet their effectiveness, efficiency, and sustainability goals. Given how engrained our products and services are in our customers’ operations, we are in a position to help them improve their performance in almost all key environmental areas, including reducing water, transportation, energy, greenhouse gas, packaging, waste, and chemical usage, as well as helping them extend equipment and product life and improve chemical and employee safety.
Our comprehensive approach to sustainability is also reflected in our commitment to our own employees. We have set internal goals to eliminate recordable workplace injuries, train 100% of our employees on our Code of Conduct, and strengthen our community relations in the locations in which we operate. Protecting and caring for our people also means investing in their future. We believe in providing our employees with resources to help them develop leadership capabilities and advance their careers. We seek to maintain a company culture that fosters a true sense of purpose among our people that we believe will drive long-term success.
Finally, we lead by example by improving the environmental impact of our own operations. We have identified ambitious operational goals to continue to reduce and improve the impact we have on our planet by 2025. Key goals include, but are not limited to, a 10% reduction in energy intensity, greenhouse gas emission intensity, and waste to landfill, a 5% reduction in water use intensity, reducing our packaging footprint, and achieving 100% compliance with our Responsible Chemistry Policy.
As we look to the future, we believe sustainability will continue to grow in importance for our customers. We are investing heavily and are well positioned to support our customers’ growing needs in this area, and as we do so, we will have the opportunity to further embed ourselves in their operations and grow with them.
We team up with customers to forge socially responsible circularity. We operate three social impact initiatives called Soap For Hope, Linens For Life, and Coffee Briques that illustrate our long-standing commitment to sustainability. Instead of discarding materials in landfills at the end of their useful life, we repurpose, or “upcycle,” soap products, linens and coffee briques in ways that create economic and social value, particularly for people in need. In recognition of the value of these initiatives and their benefit to the community, we were awarded 'Asia's Best Community Care Company of the Year'.
We believe our mission, culture, and social impact initiatives increase our employee engagement and ultimately lead to creating value and innovation for our employees, customers, and stakeholders.
Our Business Operations
Manufacturing and Supply Chain Inputs.  We manufacture a diverse portfolio of finished goods utilizing a combination of internal manufacturing facilities and strategic contract manufacturing. We maintain a global manufacturing network, operating 26 facilities on a global basis, with six factories in North America, ten factories in Europe, three factories in the Middle East and Africa, three factories in Latin America and four factories in the Asia-Pacific region. Our facilities provide a strong base of owned and leased production facilities in established geographies and key emerging markets.
Our manufacturing strategy consists of using both internal and external manufacturing, which enables a flexible and geographically effective supply chain network for our solutions. Contract manufacturing complements our internal manufacturing capabilities and supports our existing offerings as well as innovations and new product launches, while also allowing us to pursue an asset-light business model. We contract with approximately 25 large strategic contract manufacturers which we believe efficiently augment our global supply chain network with additional geographic coverage and production capabilities. In developed markets, we use these strategic contract manufacturers to leverage variable capacity for unique production capabilities. In emerging markets, contract manufacturers provide strategic capacity where we do not yet have critical mass. Where contract manufacturing is used, the production processes mirror those of our internal manufacturing plants to ensure quality control. In total, we also use approximately 350 third-party manufacturers for sourcing highly unique or specialty products included in our product portfolio.
Our primary raw material inputs include caustic soda, solvents, waxes, phosphates, surfactants, polymers and resins, chelates, fragrances and wipes substrate material, all of which are generally available from multiple suppliers. Our packaging purchases include bag-in-the-box containers, bottles, corrugated boxes, drums, pails, totes, aerosol cans, caps, triggers and valves. Our equipment and accessories purchases include dilution control equipment, warewashing and laundry equipment, floor care machines, air care dispensers, floor care applicators, mops, microfiber, buckets, carts and other items used in facility maintenance.
We have long-term relationships with an extensive network of suppliers. Supplier contracts are typically multiyear, with set pricing and renewal features built in and flexibility to adjust prices on the basis of underlying fluctuations in raw material costs. The majority of our critical raw material inputs are common to the industry and produced in all regions by multiple large, global suppliers, ensuring attractive input prices. We believe most components related to raw materials, equipment and accessories are readily available from multiple sources and to the extent possible, we offset higher costs of materials through pricing increases.
We generally operate on a yearly contracting cycle, using competitive request for proposal, or RFP, processes, e-auctions and open market events to select suppliers. Supply agreements are generally requirement-based, linked to demand in the annual operating plan and contain no or minimal contingent liability extending beyond one to two years.
Sales and Marketing.  We reach customers through a combination of direct sales channels and distribution channels. Direct sales channels represented approximately 80% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2021, including “ship-through” sales, which involve a distributor-facilitated fulfillment where the customer relationship is managed by Diversey, while distribution channels represented the remaining 20% of our sales for the year ended December 31, 2021. We employ a balanced marketing strategy with a global direct sales force as well as a broad network of third-party distributors in key locations, whereas many of our competitors sell solely or primarily through third-party distributors. We believe that this hybrid sales approach differentiates us, as our direct-sales capability is highly valued by many of our customers given the increasing importance of hygiene, while our use of third-party distributors helps us optimize operations in a cost-effective manner.
Our manufacturing network is supported by a global customer facing team of approximately 5,700 sales, marketing, technical service and customer service representatives. Our direct sales force manages relationships with our large global and regional customers while our third-party distributor partners enable us to reach end-users that would not be as efficient for us to serve on a direct basis. We have invested in extensive training for our direct sales force and the management of our distributor network, and we support our sales force with a deep bench of technical service representatives.
Our global strategic accounts help differentiate us from many of our competitors and are a source of significant market insight and growth through our “acquire, retain, and grow strategy”. Global strategic accounts help us build long-term contractual relationships, set standards of hygiene, infection prevention and cleaning, facilitate adoption of industry best practices, and provide a platform for local growth. In our Institutional business we have approximately 60 global strategic accounts, representing approximately 20% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2021, and a robust pipeline of strategic accounts with projects under implementation and opportunities to win substantial incremental sales. Sales for our global strategic accounts in 2021 were slightly 
below 2020 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has negatively impacted some of the sectors in which we operate (Retail, Building Service Contractors and partially in Food Service).
Research and Development. We maintain significant R&D capabilities to ensure we continue to remain an innovator and technological leader. We develop new products, applications, services, and processes while providing technical assistance to improve our customers’ operations. We are increasingly leveraging our digital capabilities in R&D, which we believe further differentiates us from our competitors.

Our value proposition is rooted in the integration of our proprietary technologies with our customers’ manufacturing and service delivery value chain. We have R&D and application support facilities in locations around the globe, including in North America, South America, Europe and Asia, to facilitate hands-on interaction with our customers. Our R&D engineering personnel innovate through both internal creation and development as well as through identifying and integrating third-party resources and technologies. We maintain a robust pipeline of new product development projects, which are in various stages of discovery and development.
Customers. Our Institutional and Food & Beverage segments serve customers across a wide variety of stable and growing end-markets. We are one of only two global players with the capabilities to serve GSAs, which represents more than 20% of our revenues. Approximately 84% of our customer relationships exceed 10 years in length. We have minimal customer concentration and high customer diversity as our largest customer accounted for 2.0% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2021, while our top 10 and 50 customers represented 13% and 26% of our net sales over the same period, respectively. Our highly fragmented customer base adds to the stability of our revenue streams as activity across different customer groups is very diverse and independent of activity among other customer verticals.
Our end-users span a wide range of business verticals, including, among other, healthcare, food service, retail and grocery, educational institutions, food and beverage, building service contractors, cash and carry establishments, government institutions, industrial plants, and on-premises laundry.
Our customers value both the products we sell as well as our application expertise, deep industry process knowledge, and project engineering capabilities. These capabilities maximize product and operational efficiency for our customers, resulting in sticky relationships. Additionally, we provide customized solutions for customers that are integrated into their sites, which encourage mutual investment in infrastructure and expands our value proposition, resulting in customer loyalty and retention.
Our Competition
In general, the markets in which we operate are led by two large companies: Diversey and Ecolab Inc., with the rest of the market served by smaller entities focusing on more limited geographic regions or a smaller subset of products and services. Our business competes on the basis of its demonstrated value, technical expertise, innovation, chemical formulations, customer support, detection equipment, monitoring capabilities, and dosing and dispensing equipment. Given our scale and global reach, we are able to uniquely service GSAs and provide consistent, quality solutions across sites. Our machines also differentiate us from our competitors, as no other competitor offers an equivalent range of product and service offerings, as well as machines, allowing us to provide our customers with end-to-end solutions.
Our scale provides a competitive benefit versus smaller local or regional competitors, as we are able to leverage our distribution network to service smaller customers in a cost-effective way.
Given the size and fragmented nature of the markets in which we operate, we do not currently have significant concern about our competition.
We believe that the fragmented nature of our markets, combined with our flexible go-to-market strategy and diverse product and solution set, should enable Diversey to grow organically and via an acquisition strategy.
Our Intellectual Property
We strategically manage our portfolio of patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property. Specifically, we rely upon trade secrets to protect the formulation of many of our chemical products, as well as our manufacturing processes. We own or license patents and trademarks which are used in connection with our business. Some of these patents or licenses cover significant product formulations and processes used to manufacture our products. As of December 31, 2021, we held over 1,400 patents in the United States and foreign countries, and have numerous pending patent applications. We do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims.
The trademarks of major products in each business are registered in key jurisdictions or licensed from third parties. Certain intellectual property is also protected by confidentiality agreements or other agreements with suppliers, employees and other third parties. In part, our success can be attributed to the existence and continued protection of these trademarks, patents and trade secrets.
The Diversey trademark and a select number of major sub-brands, including CLAX, SUMA and TASKI are material to our business. We own the Diversey and sub-brand trademarks as used in our business. While the Diversey trademark and certain other assets in our intellectual property portfolio are important, we do not believe that our overall business is materially dependent on any individual trade name, trademark or patent.
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 8,700 employees worldwide, including full-time and part-time employees. Approximately 1,000 of these employees were in the U.S., and approximately 7,700 employees were outside the U.S. In various countries, certain of our employees are unionized and, where local law requires, participate in works councils. Our customer facing team is approximately 5,700 employees and includes sales, marketing, technical service and customer service representatives. We believe that our employee relations are satisfactory.
Our employees are at the heart of our mission and strategies, and we focus on our culture to drive both.
Our Core Values.
Our culture starts, first and foremost, with our mission: “To protect and care for people through providing leading hygiene, infection prevention, and cleaning solutions.” Our mission unites and aligns our employees to serve a greater good in this world. This unity has been most evident during the recent global COVID-19 pandemic, as our employees have worked heroically to help protect and care for people around the world. In 2021, we reaffirmed the behaviors that we want Diversey to be known for as part of the way we work and hold each other accountable. Our behaviors are not empty words to be hung on a wall. The things we do, and the way we behave, define our culture. They empower us to deliver what we promise.
These behaviors are:
Inclusive.  A culture of collaboration. Diversey is a place that welcomes thoughts and ideas from all of our employees. People who feel comfortable coming to work and being themselves can achieve more. We hire and promote based on merit and develop talent within the organization. Our customers are diverse and operate in many different industries; therefore, we cannot be an organization with just one way of thinking. Our culture is inclusive of ideas and people. Sharing information and best practices improves all that we do.
Customer driven.  Delighting customers is at the heart of our business. Diversey elevates our customers and their experiences. We engage with our customers to know how we can protect them; how we can take care of them and how we can help solve their problems.
Bias for Action. Action unleashes our potential. Without action, achievement is impossible. Diversey is rightly proud of its place as an industry thought leader. Thoughts are seeds for action. We plan, we act with speed - all while taking calculated risks. 
Always improving.  Experience drives our improvement every day, and we are committed to continuously evolving. We believe that we can always find ways to improve. We take our experience, in the form of data and insights, and use it to drive customer satisfaction, revenue growth, and margins.
Accountable for results. Results inform our actions. We are responsible for owning our results and we commit to understanding them, good or bad. We speak clearly and honestly about our accomplishments and help each other avoid failure and replicate success. Being accountable for results is the end and beginning of everything we do.
Diversity and Inclusion
We seek to protect and care for our employees by creating a diverse, equitable & inclusive work environment where everyone feels free to be themselves. We have a goal to increase diverse representation in our workforce, starting with achieving gender diversity in our leadership population of 40% globally and ethnic diversity of 25% in the United States by 2030. Currently, this population is 17.5% gender diverse and 15% ethnically diverse in the United States. We have also established Employee Representation Groups, which are grassroots employee networks that bring people together who share common interests and/or backgrounds and offer our employees a variety of benefits that support employees, including paid parental leave, flexible time off and solutions for nursing mothers.
Impact of COVID-19
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a meaningful impact on our business, especially within our Institutional segment. In the first quarter of 2021, strong demand for our infection prevention products and services offset volume related declines in sales to restaurants, hotels and entertainment facilities. In the remainder of 2021, we saw restrictions and lock-downs start to ease in some markets, resulting in stronger than anticipated sales in those markets, except for infection prevention products. Conversely, as expected, demand for infection prevention products and services slowed in the second quarter of 2021 to levels below the peak demand from 2020, but continuing above pre-COVID-19 levels. Sales of infection products have directionally stabilized in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2021.
In countries such as United States and the United Kingdom, with higher vaccination rates and where reopenings were more advanced, we saw faster-than-expected recovery of our base Institutional business. However, in countries such as India and Philippines, with low vaccination rates and prolonged lockdowns, the recovery levels were slower.
In the long-term, we expect that our recent product enhancements, digital investments, and cost efficiencies will result in accelerated growth as the end markets most negatively impacted by the pandemic continue to normalize and return to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels. Moreover, we expect increased demand for our infection prevention products and services to endure and settle above pre-pandemic levels. We believe the pandemic has resulted in higher disinfection standards and a favorable shift in demand for our products, thereby permanently altering the landscape for health and hygiene solutions.
Environmental Matters, Health and Safety and Governmental Regulations
As a manufacturer, we are subject to many laws, rules, standards and regulations in the countries, jurisdictions and localities in which we operate. These cover: the safe procurement, processing, storage and use of chemical raw materials and parts for tools, equipment and packaging; the potential release of materials into the environment; standards for the treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous wastes; or otherwise relate to the protection of the environment. We review environmental, health and safety laws and regulations pertaining to our operations and believe that compliance with current environmental and workplace health and safety laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
In some jurisdictions in which our products are sold or used, laws and regulations have been adopted or proposed that seek to regulate, among other things, minimum levels of recycled or reprocessed material and, more generally, 
the design for reuse of packaging materials. We maintain programs designed to comply with these laws and regulations and to closely monitor their evolution.
Various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations regulate our products and often require us to obtain pre-market approval of our products and comply with specified requirements. In the U.S., we must register our sanitizing and disinfecting products with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and products intended for controlling microbial growth on humans, animals and processed foods with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Such products are regulated in a similar way at the European Union level by the European Chemical Agency or by member state competent authorities. Similar requirements exist in other countries such as China, Russia and South Korea. To date, the cost of complying with such product registration requirements has not had a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this report are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements give our current expectations and projections relating to our financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business. You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. These statements may include words such as “anticipate”, “estimate”, “expect”, “project”, “plan”, “intend”, “believe”, “may”, “will”, “should”, “can have”, “likely” and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of the timing or nature of future operating or financial performance or other events. For example, all statements we make relating to our estimated and projected costs, expenditures, cash flows, growth rates and financial results or our plans and objectives for future operations, growth initiatives, or strategies are forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those that we expected, including:
• the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic may cause disruptions to our operations, customer demand, and our suppliers’ ability to support us;
• uncertain global economic conditions which have had and could continue to have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations;
• the global nature of our operations exposes us to numerous risks that could materially adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations;
• fluctuations between non-U.S. currencies and the U.S. dollar could materially impact our consolidated financial condition or results of operations;
• political and economic instability and risk of government actions affecting our business and our customers or suppliers may adversely impact our business, results of operations and cash flows;
• raw material pricing, availability and allocation by suppliers as well as energy-related costs may negatively impact our results of operations, including our profit margins;
• if we do not develop new and innovative products or if customers in our markets do not accept them, our results would be negatively affected;
• cyber risks and the failure to maintain the integrity of our operational or security systems or infrastructure;
• the introduction of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting may adversely affect our effective rate of tax in future periods;
• the consolidation of customers may adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition or results of operations;
• we experience competition in the markets for our products and services and in the geographic areas in which we operate;
• instability and uncertainty in the credit and financial markets could adversely impact the availability of credit that we and our customers need to operate our business;
• new and stricter regulations may affect our business and consolidated condition and results of operations; and
• the other risks described under “Risk Factors” below.
We derive many of our forward-looking statements from our operating budgets and forecasts, which are based on many detailed assumptions. While we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, we caution that it is very difficult to predict the impact of known factors, and it is impossible for us to anticipate all factors that could affect our actual results. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, or cautionary statements, are disclosed under “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Form 10-K. All written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us, or persons acting on our behalf, are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements as well as other cautionary statements that are made from time to time in our other SEC filings and public communications. You should evaluate all forward-looking statements made in this report in the context of these risks and uncertainties.
We caution you that the important factors referenced above may not contain all of the factors that are important to you. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will realize the results or developments we expect or anticipate or, even if substantially realized, that they will result in the consequences or affect us or our operations in the way we expect. The forward-looking statements included in this Form 10-K are made only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as otherwise required by law.
