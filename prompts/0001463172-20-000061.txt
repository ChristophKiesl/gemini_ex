Item 1. Business.
Overview
We believe we’re living in a time of radical change in customer expectations that requires organizations to change the way they do business and serve their customers. Customers have more power, more information, and more options than ever before. This means the organizations they do business with have to earn and re-earn their business through a memorable and differentiated customer experience. To position themselves for success, organizations must integrate service into every point of interaction and use customer insights and data to enrich the customer experience across their organizations.
Zendesk is a service-first customer relationship management (“CRM”) company, built to give organizations of all sizes, in every industry, the ability to deliver a transparent, responsive, and empowering customer experience. With solutions designed to address an increasingly broader set of customer interactions, Zendesk allows organizations to deliver omnichannel customer service, customize and build apps across the customer journey, and extend beyond support into sales.
We are a software development company and were founded in Copenhagen, Denmark in 2007. We reincorporated in Delaware in 2009. Our principal executive offices are located at 1019 Market Street, San Francisco, California 94103, and our telephone number is (415) 418-7506. Our website address is www.zendesk.com.

The Zendesk Approach
We build software that helps organizations deliver better customer experiences, and we believe in an approach to both product design and delivery that is unique and innovative. As software becomes more central to the customer experience, we strive to design solutions that are easy to use, yet robust and sophisticated for all types and sizes of organizations and across all industries. Our focus on these core principles has led us to design customer experience solutions that share the following characteristics:

• | Easy to use and implement: We build our solutions first and foremost for the people that use them every day. We focus on making the user experience intuitive and product implementation fast while managing complex processes and interactions on the backend of our software. Because of our attention to ease of use, we believe organizations who use our solutions are more effective and efficient, and are able to engage with and deliver better experiences to their customers as a result.


• | Open and flexible platform: We believe that the establishment of open and public cloud computing has fundamentally changed how organizations can and will build their customer experiences. Our flexible CRM platform leverages public cloud technologies and open standards. Organizations are able to connect and integrate customer data to build customer-focused experiences, by providing relevant customer data in one modern, flexible, and developer-friendly environment. Our platform enables many audiences - from customer support agents, to developers, to sales representatives - to get a more complete picture of the customer so they can deliver personalized experiences and adapt to evolving customer expectations.


• | Expanding access to analytics and data science: We are committed to enabling and empowering organizations of all sizes to better understand their customers through analytics that unify data across our product and platform solutions and connect easily to outside data sources. We believe our investments in building machine learning and artificial intelligence into our solutions gives more organizations and users access to data science so they can be more efficient, informed, and proactive with their customers.


• | A more conversational experience: Through our product and platform solutions, we enable organizations to have more natural conversations with their customers, allowing even some of the largest organizations to transform how they engage with customers regardless of how and when those customers want to communicate. As we expand the

reach of our technology, we recognize the critical importance of having our solutions work cohesively together and we are continuing to invest in supporting our product solutions on a shared services platform.
We have witnessed business software undergo a sweeping shift toward consumerization over the past decade. Zendesk has embraced this shift with an approach to delivering customer experience solutions that is different from earlier generations of business software. Our goal is to remove barriers that make business software difficult to buy, deploy, and use. Our approach to software delivery focuses on the following key elements:

• | Elastic and agile: Our product and platform solutions can easily grow and scale with our customers and be used in new departments and use cases without the expensive deployment projects required in the past. Zendesk product solutions are flexible by design and easy to configure and use. In addition to our product solutions, we enable our customers through our platform solution, which gives customers the freedom to build customer applications and experiences using open tools and cloud architecture, instead of proprietary tools and technology.


• | Try before you buy: We believe customers should be able to try our solutions and see how they work before they commit to a purchase. Free trials are core to the marketing of our solutions and we can deliver fast prototypes and proof of concepts for our most sophisticated prospective customers. We offer a wide range of trial experiences for our solutions, ranging from introductory offerings to experiences geared towards larger organizations, each with an ability to begin an implementation during the evaluation period.


• | Price transparency: We provide our customers a well-defined total cost of ownership across our solutions by providing transparent and predictable pricing. Our pricing is designed to make our software accessible to customers of all sizes by offering a variety of subscription packages that include features based on customer need. We offer subscriptions that may be purchased online and deployed without the need to engage a sales or enablement professional.

Growth Strategy
Zendesk was founded with a mission to help organizations build better relationships with their customers. We have continued to pursue that mission by building and delivering our customer experience solutions, which include product solutions and a CRM platform, that help organizations be the company their customers want them to be. We believe our future growth will be a natural extension of our mission, and we are focused on the following key growth drivers:

• | Expanding our market by maturing and investing in our customer experience solutions: From our roots in customer support software, we have evolved to helping organizations design, build, and manage their entire customer experience infrastructure and transform how they interact and proactively engage with their customers. Our product solutions have expanded to serve the entire customer journey. Our focus is to engage in customer-facing conversations for our customers and to expand our footprint in support, sales, and beyond. We will continue to mature our product and platform features and usability across communication channels, while also integrating and expanding our solutions across CRM functions.

Our objective is to enhance the customer experience through our CRM platform. With our platform solution, we provide organizations the ability to unify and use customer data to build a more complete picture of that customer and deliver them unique experiences. Developers gain the ability to build and deploy custom apps and services faster because of the flexibility, scale, and capabilities of the public cloud. With the addition of our messaging platform to our CRM platform, organizations can build more unified conversational experiences by integrating social, web, and mobile messaging channels into their own apps and services. We will continue to expand the capabilities of our platform solution and its integration with our product solutions.
Additionally, we will continue our investments in building machine learning and artificial intelligence into our product and platform solutions, empowering organizations to harness the power of data science and be more efficient, informed, and proactive with their customers.

• | Being strategic partners with our customers who are larger organizations: With our customer experience solutions, we are increasingly evolving from a software vendor to a trusted partner that is strategically engaging with our customers around their visions and digital transformations. We are helping organizations build or transform their organizations around their customer experience. We are scaling these capabilities by continuing to build and mature our expertise in sales, success, relationships, systems architecture, and integrations. Additionally, we are continuing to

develop a partner ecosystem strategy to help us reach and serve more of our customers who are larger organizations and build a community of developer evangelists for our CRM platform.

• | Making experiences simple for organizations and their customers: At our core, we believe that customer experiences should be simple and effortless. This belief has enabled us to build a compelling brand and leadership position among both small-to-medium sized organizations and larger organizations for which our ease of use, quick return on investment, and flexible pricing are important differentiators. Our customer experience solutions provide simple interfaces across the customer journey and multiple communication channels for organizations interacting with their customers. Additionally, our product and platform solutions have been built on the premise that our solutions should be easy to discover, deploy, and purchase so that any organization, from startup to large organizations, can realize their value.


• | Intentionally differentiate for our customers: With more than 150,000 paid customer accounts as of December 31, 2019, our customers range from startups to traditional small and midsized organizations to large organizations. These customers have very different dynamics and needs. To better engage with our customers, we are differentiating our offerings and services. For large organizations, we want to be the strategic provider of modern customer experiences, built on and extended with our platform solution. To accomplish this, we aim to continue to develop and focus a coordinated team to collaborate product development, go-to-market initiatives, and customer support for our customers that are larger organizations. For our customers who are smaller and midsized, we want to continue to be the easiest CRM software to implement, use, and scale. We will continue to enhance our self-service capabilities for our customers' standard needs and requests, while engaging with our customers on higher-value strategic initiatives.

Our principle of democratizing software has developed into an efficient business model represented by expansion within customer accounts and organic growth through promotion by our customers. We will continue our focus on providing customer experience solutions that create simple and straightforward experiences for both our customers and the organizations they support.
With our customer experience solutions, Zendesk has served a global market and, for the year ended December 31, 2019, we generated 48% of our revenue outside of the United States. We have customers in more than 160 countries and territories, and solutions available in more than 30 languages. We will continue to invest in expanding our global footprint, particularly in those markets where we have demonstrated significant customer traction with our democratized approach or which represent particularly strategic opportunities. We are also taking a more coordinated approach to our business outside the U.S. to further invest in our international business. We plan to continue to develop our leadership in sales and operations, standardize processes and metrics, and share best practices across regions.
Zendesk Product Solutions
Zendesk’s customer experience solutions are built to help organizations address the rise in customer expectations and to craft their customer experiences into a competitive differentiator. Zendesk product solutions are developed to support a shared services infrastructure and common customer data platform. Zendesk’s solutions are developed using agile software techniques, and are designed to quickly incorporate and innovate on customer feedback obtained through extensive early access programs. This approach allows us to share our newest technology with customers, and quickly adapt our solutions to address customer needs.
Zendesk offers solutions that are used throughout the customer lifecycle by key customer facing teams, including support, sales, customer success, and more.

• | Zendesk Support, our flagship product solution, is an easy to use system for tracking, prioritizing, and solving customer support tickets across multiple channels, bringing customer information and interactions into one place.


• | Zendesk Chat is live chat software that provides a fast and responsive way to connect with customers in the moment, on websites, in applications, and on mobile devices.


• | Zendesk Talk is cloud-based call center software for more personal and productive phone and short message service support conversations and enables organizations to provide phone support from the same platform they use to manage all other support channels.


• | Zendesk Guide is a knowledge base that powers both customer self-service and support agent productivity through content that is created and organized by our customers. Guide content is available via self-service website, accessible through APIs on websites, in apps and mobile devices, and surfaced to agents within Support and Chat. Additionally, Answer Bot is a feature within Guide that uses machine learning to automatically answer customers’ questions by suggesting content from the Guide knowledge base.


• | Zendesk Sell is a sales CRM product solution to enhance productivity, processes, and pipeline visibility for sales teams. Sell is simple and designed to keep sales representatives selling. Sell eliminates the friction from deal updates so representatives and management are always able to access, analyze, and collaborate on relevant deal data.


• | Zendesk Explore provides analytics for organizations to measure and improve the entire customer experience, with instant access to the customer analytics that matter—and the deeper understanding of customers and business that comes with it.

The Zendesk Suite is a pre-configured and pre-packaged bundle of our Support, Chat, Guide, and Talk solutions, offering organizations methods to let customer conversations continue across channels, creating a better experience for both organizations and their customers. Additionally, Zendesk provides unique price and product tiering for our solutions so that we evolve with our customers as they grow from startups to large organizations.
Zendesk’s platform solutions and developer tools allow organizations to extend the functionality of our customer experience solutions, integrate into internal and third-party systems, and customize the experience for their employees and customers. Key components include:

• | Zendesk Sunshine, our open and flexible CRM platform solution, allows organizations to address an increasingly broader set of customer experiences. Sunshine provides organizations with the ability to develop a more complete picture of their customer with flexible databases and the ability to model, store and manage customer profiles, events, objects and relationships. Organizations can connect and integrate this data across our product solutions with other business applications to build highly specialized workflow and unique customer experiences.


• | Sunshine Conversations, Zendesk’s messaging platform solution, helps organizations build immersive messaging experiences across channels. The platform empowers organizations to proactively engage customers, introduce bots and drive automation, and design bespoke messaging experiences that help customers transact directly within the conversation, such as browsing products, making reservations, and making payments.


• | Zendesk Embeddables, a combination of our application programming interfaces, or APIs, web widget, and mobile software development kits allow developers to embed Support, Chat, and Guide experiences natively on the web and within mobile applications.


• | Zendesk APIs are extensible and built on open standards, allowing users to build custom integrations and interact with Zendesk data using over 400 different API endpoints.


• | Zendesk Apps enable organizations to customize Zendesk product and platform solution interfaces and optimize workflow through powerful plug-ins. Our customers can build custom apps or select from hundreds of pre-built apps on the Zendesk Marketplace.

Technology
We employ a modern technology architecture in which our solutions are built upon a set of core APIs that enable rapid innovation and deep integration. The technology infrastructure used for the Zendesk customer experience solutions are designed to provide a highly available and scalable cloud-based platform with industry-standard security measures.
Zendesk’s strategy is to leverage the open and public cloud both in hosting our applications and building Sunshine as a development platform, for both extensions of Zendesk as well as to power their own applications and experiences. We believe this provides Zendesk and our customers with greater reliability, performance, and flexibility than operating through proprietary platforms and self-managed data centers.
The architecture and deployment of our software are described and guided by the following key characteristics:

• | Reliability. Our customers are highly dependent on our solutions, which are designed to be available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. We provide transparency to customers on availability and technical operations matters that impact them through our website and other channels.


• | Scalability. Our data infrastructure is highly scalable and regularly processes hundreds of millions of data driven requests that require the processing of specific data.


• | Security. Each of our solutions is designed to host a large quantity of customer data. We maintain a comprehensive security program designed to help safeguard the security and integrity of our customers’ data. We regularly review our security program. In addition, we regularly obtain third-party security audits and examinations of our technical operations and practices covering data security.

Customers
As of December 31, 2019, we had an aggregate of approximately 157,000 paid customer accounts using our solutions. This includes approximately 81,200 customer accounts for paid subscription plans for Zendesk Support (other than our legacy Starter plan) and approximately 42,600 customer accounts for paid subscription plans of Zendesk Chat. In addition, we had approximately 33,200 paid customer accounts on our other solutions, collectively, as of December 31, 2019. Prior to purchase, we generally provide our prospective customers with the opportunity to try fully-functioning versions of our solutions for a free trial period. This is a central part of our business model as we believe customers should have the right to try solutions before being locked into a subscription. Providing our customers with a free trial period exposes customers to our brand and establishes a relationship that can facilitate further adoption of our solutions as organizations grow in size and their needs become more complex. For further details as to how we calculate our number of paid customer accounts, please see the discussion in the "Key Business Metrics" section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our customers are located in over 160 countries and territories and represent organizations across a broad array of sizes, industries, and geographies.
Research and Development
Our research and development organization is responsible for the development, design, and testing of all aspects of our product and platform solutions. We invest heavily in these efforts to continuously improve and innovate. In addition to our product and platform solutions, we have developed multi-functional APIs that we utilize to build our solutions as well as facilitate integrations of our solutions with third-party applications.
Our global research and development team is primarily based in San Francisco, California; Melbourne, Australia; Dublin, Ireland; Krakow, Poland; Copenhagen, Denmark; Singapore; Madison, Wisconsin; Montreal, Canada; and Montpellier, France. To foster rapid innovation, our research and development team is further apportioned into smaller, agile development teams.
We deploy new features, functionality, and technologies across our solutions through software releases or updates in order to minimize disruption and provide for constant improvement.
To create a product roadmap that meets our customers’ needs, we emphasize collaboration during the development process. Customers provide input through feedback forums, dialogue with our product support and research and development teams, and feature utilization. As a result of using our solutions internally to support our customers, we also develop new or improved features based on our own employees’ feedback.
As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 1,010 employees in our research and development organization. Our research and development expenses were $208 million, $160 million, and $115 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.
Sales and Marketing
Subscriptions to our product and platform solutions are designed to be easy to purchase. A substantial number of our customers subscribe to our solutions with limited or no direct interaction with our sales team.
We also deploy a direct sales approach, which includes a sales team based in four regional hubs: North America, LATAM (Latin America), EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa), and APAC (Asia-Pacific). This team manages prospective 
and current customers, aiming to initiate, retain, and expand their use of our solutions over time, and is responsible for driving expansions and renewals of existing contracts. Our sales team also partners with sales and product engineers to provide pre-sales technical support to prospective customers.
We expect to continue increasing penetration into larger organizations through a land and expand strategy whereby we attempt to capitalize on the use of our solutions by a functional or geographic department to expand the use of our solutions throughout the organization. Through our sales team, we also seek to discover and work with a growing number of forward-thinking organizations on larger initiatives to transform their approach to customer experience.
We also utilize indirect sales channels, including referral partners and resellers, as well as implementation partners. These channel partners provide additional sales coverage, particularly in geographic markets where we may have limited presence, as well as implementation services to our customers. We plan to continue investing in these relationships to help us in certain markets and to complement our direct sales efforts.
Our marketing efforts are focused on generating awareness of our solutions, creating sales leads, nurturing prospective customers through the process of product discovery and evaluation, establishing and promoting our brand, and cultivating a community of successful and vocal customers. Based on our belief that the best method to sell subscriptions to our solutions is to provide customers with the opportunity to actively use and explore our solutions’ capabilities, one focus of our marketing team is to drive and encourage free trials and the successful conversion of free trials to paid subscriptions. We utilize both online and offline marketing initiatives, including digital advertising such as search engine, paid social, e-mail and product marketing, content marketing, user events, conferences, corporate communications, web marketing and optimization, and outbound list and contact generation.
As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 1,280 employees in our sales and marketing organizations. Our sales and marketing expenses were $397 million, $292 million, and $212 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.
Product Support, Customer Success, and Professional Services
We strive to exemplify the great customer experiences that organizations of all sizes can provide with our product and platform solutions by offering multi-channel service from our product support team, a rich self-help knowledge base with detailed product guides, and active community forums for agents, managers, and developers.
We offer different levels of product support based upon the subscription plans purchased by our customers. Regardless of the plan purchased, our solutions provide a unified intuitive interface, connectivity to our self-help knowledge base and community forums, and step-by-step tutorials to help users learn, use, and deploy our solutions effectively.
We additionally offer a variety of customer success initiatives aimed to address customer needs with varying levels of complexity, from our small business customers to even our largest customers. These initiatives are designed to ensure that our customers are best equipped to meet their business goals and to realize the full value of the implementation of our solutions.
Along with our global partners, our professional services team assists our customers in implementing more complex deployments of our solutions. These services include mapping our solutions to new and existing business processes, data migration, and integration with existing systems. Service engagements are typically scoped on a time and materials or project milestone basis and billed separately from the subscription to our solutions.
Through our training platform, we offer courses to help our customers quickly learn how to effectively use our solutions as well as implement best practices. Courses are available online, in-person at events, and, as requested by certain customers, on-site. Our training sessions are typically targeted at specific levels of employee seniority and product experience, such as agent essentials or administrator expert, to more effectively tailor training to intended audiences.
Seasonality
Historically, we have experienced the highest demand for our solutions and services in our fourth quarter, which we believe is a result of industry buying patterns. For a more detailed discussion of the seasonality impacting our business, see the “Seasonality” discussion in the "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Competition
There are a number of established and emerging competitors in the broad market of customer engagement software. This market is fragmented, rapidly evolving, and highly competitive, with relatively low barriers to entry in some segments. We consider the principal competitive differentiators in our market to include:

• | Time to value realization;


• | Enablement of customer communications across channels;


• | Availability of self-service options;


• | Data-rich analytics and performance recommendations;


• | Mobile and multi-device capabilities;


• | Product solutions that are open and flexible;


• | Proactive outreach tools;


• | Ease-of-deployment and use;


• | Product solutions grounded in customer experience;


• | Customization and integration with third-party applications;


• | Brand recognition and thought leadership; and


• | Total cost of ownership for the customer (including software updates, ongoing maintenance, and consulting and system integration fees).

While we believe that we successfully compete with respect to these dynamics, given the large number, disparate sizes, and varying areas of focus of other organizations with which we compete in the provision of customer experience solutions, we may not always compare favorably with respect to some or all of the foregoing factors.
For small to medium-sized organizations, we often compete with general use computer applications and other tools that organizations have adapted for managing relationships with their customers, including shared accounts for email communication, phone banks for voice communication, and pen and paper, text editors, and spreadsheets for tracking and management. In addition, we compete with a number of other SaaS providers with focused applications competitive to one or more of our product and platform solutions that our potential customers may elect to use in lieu of our solutions, and such providers may be able to offer their products at a lower price due to the focused nature of their applications. For larger organizations, we compete with custom software systems and software vendors geared towards larger organizations, including salesforce.com, Inc., Oracle Corporation, Microsoft Corporation, and ServiceNow, Inc., each of which may have greater operational flexibility to bundle competing products and services with other software offerings, or offer them at a lower price than our current Suite offering, which will negatively affect our competitiveness for that offering. Other established SaaS providers not currently focused on the functionality that our solutions provide may expand their services to compete with us as well. Further, large enterprise software vendors have a greater ability to aggressively price their product at a level below their typical selling price in order to gain market share, decreasing our ability to compete successfully with such vendors in certain regions. Additionally, some existing and potential customers, particularly large organizations, have elected, and may in the future elect, to develop their own internal customer support software system. Pricing pressures and increased competition generally could result in reduced sales, reduced margins, losses, or the failure of our solutions to achieve or maintain more widespread market acceptance, any of which could harm our business.
In order to maintain and improve our competitive position in the market, we remain focused in our development, operations, and sales and marketing efforts on the evolving customer service needs of all organizations.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright, and trademark laws, a variety of contractual arrangements, such as license agreements, assignment agreements, confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements, and confidentiality procedures and technical measures to gain rights to and protect the intellectual property used in our business. 
We have developed a patent program, and a strategy to identify, apply for, and secure patents for innovative aspects of our platform and technology. We have five issued U.S. patents and 15 U.S. patent applications pending. We intend to pursue additional patent protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost-effective.
We actively pursue registration of our trademarks, logos, service marks, and domain names in the United States and in other key jurisdictions. We are the registered holder of a variety of United States and international domain names that include the term Zendesk or certain variations. Our solutions and services utilize our “Zendesk” trademark as well as our logo and images.
We also rely on certain intellectual property rights that we license from third parties, including under certain open source licenses. Though such third-party technologies may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, we believe that alternative technologies would be available to us.
Our policy is to require employees and independent contractors to sign agreements assigning to us any inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship, developments, and other processes generated by them on our behalf and agreeing to protect our confidential information, and all of our key employees and contractors have done so. In addition, we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our vendors and customers. We also control and monitor access to, and distribution of, our software, documentation, and other proprietary information. 
Although we rely on intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, a variety of contractual arrangements, and confidentiality procedures, we believe that factors such as the technical and creative skills of our personnel, development of new features and functionality, and frequent enhancements to our solutions are more fundamental to establishing and maintaining our technology leadership position.
Culture and Employees
As a company, we are investing in the future of our employee experience with a similar philosophy to our view on the future of customer experience. We value simplicity, agility, sincerity, as well as a sense of humor and humility often absent from large organizations. Just as we build our solutions first and foremost for the people that use them every day, we also build an organization and culture that trusts, values, and empowers our employees. We are a global, inclusive team who actively embraces diverse sets of perspectives. We are firm believers that each employee can make an impact and that together we can solve big challenges through innovation and teamwork.
We also believe strongly in our obligation to participate in and improve the communities where we work and live. Taking a hyperlocal approach to giving back, we support an array of corporate social responsibility engagements. We also support our neighborhoods worldwide with grants from the Zendesk Neighbor Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to providing financial and strategic support to organizations working to strengthen neighborhoods in and around where Zendesk does business. With a focus on addressing homelessness and poverty, promoting technical literacy, and advancing diversity and gender equality in our communities, we empower our employees through education and training, volunteer opportunities, and authentic community engagement.
As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 3,570 employees, including approximately 1,840 employees located outside the United States. Although we have statutory employee representation obligations in certain countries, our U.S. employees are not represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Regulatory Considerations
The legal environment of Internet-based businesses is evolving rapidly in the United States and elsewhere. The manner in which existing laws and regulations are applied in this environment, and how they will relate to our business in particular, both in the United States and internationally, is often unclear. For example, we sometimes cannot be certain which laws will be deemed applicable to us given the global nature of our business, including with respect to such topics as data privacy and security, pricing, credit card fraud, advertising, taxation, content regulation, and intellectual property ownership and infringement.
Our customers, and those with whom they communicate using our product and platform solutions, upload and store customer service and other data into our solutions and provide access to such data, generally without any restrictions imposed by us. This presents legal challenges to our business and operations, such as rights of privacy related to the content loaded into our solutions. Both in the United States and internationally, we must monitor and comply with a host of legal concerns regarding the data stored and processed in our solutions by customers. We must also monitor and comply with these issues directly in the operation of our business in these jurisdictions.
We are subject to data privacy and security regulation by data protection authorities in countries throughout the world, by the U.S. federal government, and by the states in which we conduct our business. In recent years, there have been a number of well-publicized data breaches involving the improper use and disclosure of personal information of individuals. Many governing authorities have responded to these incidents by enacting laws requiring holders of personal information to maintain safeguards and to take certain actions in response to a data breach, such as providing prompt notification of the breach to affected individuals and public officials or amending existing laws to expand compliance obligations. In the European Union, U.S. companies must meet specified privacy and security standards, such as the European General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR, which governs the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data, and on the free movement of such data established in the European Union to certain non-EU countries, such as the United States. Additionally, the data protection laws of each of the European Member countries require comprehensive data privacy and security protections for consumers with respect to personal data collected about them. In February 2016, the European Union and U.S. officials announced an agreement, which established the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, or the Privacy Shield, as a means for legitimating the transfer of personal data by U.S. companies doing business in Europe from the European Economic Area to the U.S. We have certified compliance with the Privacy Shield. In June 2017, we announced that we completed the EU approval process for our global Binding Corporate Rules, or BCRs, as a data processor and data controller. This significant regulatory approval validated our implementation of the highest possible standards for protecting personal data globally, covering both the personal data of our customers and employees. We have and will continue to engage in efforts to ensure that data transfers from the European Economic Area comply with the GDPR, the Privacy Shield, our BCRs, and the data protection legislation of individual member states. Additionally, the GDPR will continue to apply in the United Kingdom until the expiration of the transition period on December 31, 2020, but it is unclear how the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union will affect the United Kingdom’s enactment of such European Union regulation thereafter, and how data transfers to and from the United Kingdom will be regulated.
In the United States, many federal, state, and foreign government bodies and agencies have adopted, or are considering adopting, laws and regulations regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information. California recently enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA that, among other things, requires covered entities to provide new disclosures to California consumers, affords such consumers new abilities to opt-out of certain sales of personal information, and gives such consumers a private right of action to enforce data breaches resulting from the covered entity's violation of its duty to implement and maintain reasonable security measures.
