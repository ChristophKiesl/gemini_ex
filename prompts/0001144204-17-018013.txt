Item 1. Business
 
Form and Year of Organization
 
American Bio Medica Corporation (the “Company”) was incorporated on April 2, 1986 under the laws of the State of New York under the name American Micro Media, Inc. On September 9, 1992, we filed an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation and changed our name to American Bio Medica Corporation.
 
Our Business
 
We manufacture and sell lateral flow immunoassay tests, primarily for the immediate detection of certain drugs in urine and oral fluids at the point of collection. Our products are accurate, self-contained, cost-effective, user-friendly products that are capable of accurately identifying the presence or absence of drugs in a sample within minutes. Our products are used by pain management and drug treatment facilities, laboratory professionals, law enforcement and other government personnel, as well as by employers and education professionals.
 
In addition to the manufacture and sale of drug testing products, we provide bulk test strip manufacturing services to unaffiliated third parties on a contract basis. We do not currently derive a significant portion of our revenues from bulk test strip contract manufacturing.
 
Our Products
 
Products for the Detection of Drugs in Urine
 
We manufacture a number of products that detect the presence or absence of certain drugs in urine. We offer a number of standard configurations, custom configurations on special order, and different cut-off levels for certain drugs. Cut-off levels are concentrations of drugs or metabolites that must be present in urine (or oral fluid) specimens before a positive result will be obtained. Our urine drug tests can detect the following drugs: amphetamines (available in some products with a cut-off level of either 500 ng/mL or 1,000 ng/mL), barbiturates, benzodiazepines, buprenorphine, cocaine (available in some products with a cut-off level of either 150 ng/mL or 300 ng/mL), MDMA (Ecstasy) (available in some products with a cut-off level of either 500 ng/mL or 1,000 ng/mL), methadone, methamphetamines (available in some products with a cut-off level of either 500 ng/mL or 1,000 ng/mL), opiates (available in some products with a cut-off level of either 300 ng/mL or 2000 ng/mL), oxycodone, PCP (phencyclidine), propoxyphene, THC (marijuana) and tricyclic antidepressants.
 
We currently offer the following urine drug tests:
 
Rapid Drug ScreenÒ: The Rapid Drug Screen, or RDS®, is a patented rapid drug test that detects the presence or absence of 2 to 10 drugs simultaneously in a single urine specimen. The RDS is available as a card only, or as part of a kit that includes a patented collection cup.
 
Rapid ONE®: The Rapid ONE product line consists of single drug tests, each of which tests for the presence or absence of a single drug in a urine specimen. The Rapid ONE is designed for those situations in which a person is known to use a specific drug. It can also be used with a RDS to allow screening of an additional drug. The Rapid ONE is currently sold in very limited markets; primarily markets outside of the United States.

RDS InCup®: The patented RDS InCup is a drug-testing cup that detects the presence or absence of 1 to 12 drugs in a urine specimen. The RDS InCup incorporates collection and testing of a urine sample in a single step. Each RDS InCup product contains multiple channels, and each channel contains a single drug-testing strip that contains the chemistry to detect a single drug.
 
Rapid TOX®: Rapid TOX is a cost-effective drug test in a cassette platform that simultaneously detects the presence or absence of 2 to 10 drugs in a urine specimen. Each Rapid TOX contains one or two channels, and each channel contains a single drug-testing strip that contains the chemistry to detect more than one drug.
 
Rapid TOX Cup® II: The patented Rapid TOX Cup II is another drug testing cup that detects the presence or absence of 1 to 14 drugs in a urine specimen. The Rapid TOX Cup II also incorporates collection and testing of the urine sample in a single step. Each Rapid TOX Cup II contains multiple channels and each channel contains a single drug-testing strip that contains the chemistry to detect more than one drug. In early 2015, we launched a second generation of the original Rapid TOX Cup II. The second generation consists of a smaller cup with smaller test strips. This smaller version results in lower material costs and allows us to be more cost competitive against foreign manufactured products.
 
Private Label Products
 
We do provide private labeled versions our Rapid TOX product to unaffiliated third parties for sale outside of the United States. As of December 31, 2016, sales of these products were not material.
 
Products for the Detection of Drugs in Oral Fluid:
 
We manufacture drugs tests that detect the presence or absence of drugs in oral fluids. These products are easy to use and provide test results within minutes with enhanced sensitivity and detection. Currently, the assays available on our oral fluid drug tests are amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cocaine, MDMA (Ecstasy), methadone, methamphetamines, opiates, PCP, propoxyphene and THC. Our oral fluid drug tests are currently marketed “for forensic use only”; see “Government Regulations” for information on the regulations related to the sale of our drug tests. We currently offer the following oral fluid drug tests:
 
OralStat®: OralStat is a patented and patent pending, innovative drug test for the detection of drugs in oral fluids. Each OralStat simultaneously tests for 6 or 10 drugs in an oral fluid specimen.
 
Private Label Products
 
We do provide private labeled versions our OralStat product to unaffiliated third parties for sale outside of the United States. As of December 31, 2016, sales of these products were not material.
Other Products
 
We distribute a number of other products related to the detection of substances of abuse. We do not manufacture these products. We do not derive a significant portion of our revenues from the sale of these products.
Rapid Reader®: The Rapid Reader is a compact, portable unit that uses a high-resolution camera to capture a picture of the results obtained when using an ABMC drug-testing product. The results are analyzed, interpreted, and sent to a data management system, which enables the user to interpret, store, transmit and print the results. The Rapid Reader system can only be used to interpret and record the results of an ABMC drug test. We obtained 510(k) marketing clearance (“Government Regulations” for a description of 510(k) marketing clearance) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) specific to our marketing of the Rapid Reader.
Adulteration and Alcohol: We currently offer a number of products that detect the presence or absence of adulterants and alcohol. Some of the adulterant test products we distribute are also incorporated into our urine drug tests. We do not derive a significant portion of our revenues from the sale of these alcohol or adulterant products.

Contract Manufacturing
 
We provide bulk test strip contract manufacturing services to non-affiliated diagnostic companies. In the year ended December 31, 2016, we manufactured a test for the detection of RSV (Respiratory Syncytial Virus; the most common cause of lower respiratory tract infections in children worldwide), and strip components for a test to detect fetal amniotic membrane rupture. In the year ended December 31, 2016, we did not derive a significant portion of our revenues from contract manufacturing. Contract manufacturing could become a greater portion of our revenues in the future, if sales of our current contract-manufacturing customers increase, or if additional applications for our technology are explored.
Our Markets
 
Rehabilitation/Drug Treatment
 
The Rehabilitation/Drug Treatment market includes people in both inpatient and outpatient treatment for substance abuse. Drug testing is a positive aspect of treatment as it aids in relapse prevention and encourages honesty both within the patient and with outside interactions. In addition, being able to accurately gauge the current drug use by patients enrolled in a substance abuse program is essential so, urine drug testing is an integral part of treatment programs, including physician office-based programs. There is typically a high frequency of testing in this market. In many residence programs, patients are tested each time they leave the facility and each time they return. In methadone and buprenorphine maintenance programs, more frequent testing provides a more complete picture of drug use habits, thus helping to direct treatment. There are advantages of using an ABMC drug test in this market, including but not limited to, less handling of the specimen, which will reduce the potential for mistakes, a "greater sense of confidentiality," and quicker (but still accurate) results. Our CLIA waived Rapid TOX product line is particularly appropriate for this market. We have submitted an application to the FDA requesting over-the-counter clearance of our Rapid TOX Cup II (all-inclusive cup). If we obtain this marketing clearance, our Rapid TOX Cup II product would also be classified as CLIA waived (a classification generally required by customers in this market segment). We currently sell our urine drug tests in this market primarily through our direct sales force and also through a number of distributors.
Pain Management
 
Drug testing in pain management is one of the major tools of adherence monitoring in the assessment of a patient’s predisposition to, and patterns of, misuse/abuse; a vital first step towards establishing and maintaining the safe and effective use of drugs in the treatment of chronic pain. There are many benefits of using an ABMC drug test; these include reducing the risk for toxicity in patients vulnerable to adverse drug effects, detecting patient non-compliance, reducing the risk of therapeutic failure, and avoiding or detecting drug-drug interaction. Additionally, drug testing enhances the physician’s ability to use drugs effectively and minimize costs. Urine is the standard body fluid used in this market for drug screening because it is readily available, it is easily collected, and it is easily handled by personnel. Urine has been preferred over serum sampling because the period of detection of a particular drug in the urine is increased, while drugs and their corresponding metabolites may only be detectable in the serum for a short period of time. Urine drug testing is also less expensive and non-invasive compared to serum testing. Our CLIA waived Rapid TOX product line is particularly appropriate for the pain management market. If we obtain over-the-counter marketing clearance from FDA for our Rapid TOX Cup II (as discussed previously), it would also be classified as CLIA waived (a classification generally required by customers in the clinical market). We currently sell our urine drug tests in this market primarily through our direct sales force and also through a number of distributors.
Other Clinical
 
Other Clinical markets include emergency rooms/hospitals, family physician offices and laboratories. There are a number of medical emergencies associated with adverse reactions, accidental drug ingestions, and misuse or abuse of prescription drugs and over-the-counter medications. To address this issue, drug testing is performed so healthcare professionals are able to ascertain the drug status of a patient before they administer pharmaceuticals or other treatment. We currently sell our urine drug tests in this market primarily through our direct sales force and also through a number of distributors. We also have a long-term relationship with one of the world’s largest clinical laboratories.

Government (including law enforcement and criminal justice) 
 
The Government market includes federal, state, county and local agencies, including police departments, adult and juvenile correctional facilities, pretrial agencies, probation, drug courts and parole departments at the federal and state levels. A significant number of individuals on parole or probation, or within federal, state, county and local correctional facilities and jails, have one or more conditions to their sentence, including but not limited to, periodic drug-testing and substance abuse treatment. We sell our products in this market through our direct sales force.
 
Employment/Workplace 
 
The Workplace market consists of pre-employment testing of job applicants, and random, cause and post-accident testing of employees. Many employers recognize the financial and safety benefits of implementing drug-free workplace programs, of which drug testing is an integral part. In some states, there are workers’ compensation and unemployment insurance premium reductions, tax deductions and other incentives for adopting these programs. The Drug-Free Workplace Act requires some federal contractors and all federal grantees to agree that they will provide drug-free workplaces as a precondition of receiving a contract or grant from a federal agency. Typically if a contractor receives a federal contract of $100,000 or more, they must enact a drug-free workplace program. Any organization or individual that has been granted a federal contract, regardless of size, must enact a drug-free workplace program. We sell our products in this market through our direct sales force and through a select network of distributors.
 
International
 
The International market consists of various markets outside of the United States. Although workplace testing is not as prevalent outside of the United States as within, the international Government and Clinical markets are somewhat in concert with their United States counterparts. One market that is significantly more prevalent outside of the United States is roadside drug testing. We sell in this market through a select network of distributors.
Our Distribution Method
 
We have a two-pronged distribution strategy that focuses on growing our business through direct sales and distributors. Our direct sales team consists of our Vice President of Sales & Marketing, Director of Latin America Sales, Regional Sales Managers, sales consultants and Inside Sales Representatives (collectively our “Direct Sales Team”); all of which are trained professionals that are experienced in DOA testing sales. Our distributors are unaffiliated entities that resell our drug-testing products either as stand-alone products or as part of a service they provide to their customers.
 
Our Direct Sales Team and network of distributors sell our products to the Rehabilitation/Drug Treatment, Pain Management, Other Clinical, Government and Employment/Workplace markets, and we sell through a network of distributors in the International market.
 
We promote our products through direct mail campaigns, selected advertising, participation at high profile trade shows, and other marketing activities. We expect to continue to recruit and utilize experienced distributors in addition to selling directly in our markets.
 
Competition
 
We compete on the following factors:
 
Pricing: The pricing structure in our markets is highly competitive. Price pressure remains to be the greatest when comparing our pricing with pricing of products manufactured outside of the United States. We continuously evaluate all aspects of our manufacturing and assembly processes to identify areas of cost savings, which would enable us to be more competitive from a pricing standpoint.
Quality: Our products are manufactured, assembled and packaged completely in the United States in accordance with quality system regulations set forth by FDA. Many companies in our industry claim their products are manufactured in the United States when in fact; their products are only packaged in the Unites States. The testing strips and in most cases the assembly of the product is done outside of the Unites States; usually in China. Products manufactured outside of the United States are generally manufactured outside of the requirements of quality system regulations set forth by FDA. In our opinion, this results in inferior, sub-par products being offered in the market. Most of our markets require accurate detection near the cut-off level of the test. Given this, we market our products as “aggressive” products; this means that our products are manufactured to detect drug use closer to the cut-off level of the test. The majority of the drug tests on the market today are less aggressive; meaning they are not as sensitive and they will miss positive results. Missing positive results can be extremely troublesome to customers from both an economic and liability perspective.

Customer and technical support: Customer and technical support are becoming more important in the drug testing market. Our customers often need guidance and assistance with certain issues, including but not limited to, test administration, drug cross reactivity and drug metabolism. We provide our customers with continuous customer and technical support on a 24/7/365 basis; staffed by our employees. We believe that this support gives us a competitive advantage since our competitors do not offer this extended service to their customers.
 
Raw Materials and Suppliers
 
The primary raw materials required for the manufacture of our test strips and our drug tests consist of antibodies, antigens and other reagents, plastic molded pieces, membranes and packaging materials. We maintain an inventory of raw materials. Currently, most raw materials are available from several sources. We own the molds and tooling for our plastic components that are custom and proprietary. The ownership of these molds affords us flexibility and control in managing the supply chain for these components. We do not own the molds and tooling for plastic components that are “stock” items.
Major Customers
 
We have a number of customers that in total represent a significant portion of our sales in the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015. One of these national account customers represented 30.9% of net sales in the year ended December 31, 2016, and 26.0% of net sales in the year ended December 31, 2015.
 
Patents and Trademarks/Licenses
 
As of December 31, 2016, we held 30 patents related to our point of collection drug-testing products, including 12 patents issued in the United States. As of December 31, 2016, we have 1 United States patent application pending and 7 foreign patent applications pending.
 
To date, we have registered 15 trademarks in the United States, including but not limited to, Rapid Drug Screen, RDS, Rapid ONE, OralStat, Rapid Reader, Rapid TOX, Rapid TOX Cup, InCup, Rapid Check, our website domain, our corporate logos and certain product logos. We have also registered 14 trademarks in countries/regions such as Canada, Mexico, Europe, and the United Kingdom.
 
Government Regulations
 
In certain markets, the development, testing, manufacture and sale of our drug tests, and possible additional testing products for other substances or conditions, are subject to regulation by the United States and foreign regulatory agencies. Pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and associated regulations, the FDA regulates the pre-clinical and clinical testing, manufacture, labeling, distribution and promotion of medical devices. A “medical device” is defined as an “instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or related article, including any component, part, or accessory, which is…intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, in man or other animals, or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animal…”.
 
When a product is a medical device, a 510(k) marketing application must be submitted to the FDA. A 510(k) is a premarketing submission made to the FDA to demonstrate that the device to be marketed is as safe and effective, that is, substantially equivalent, to a legally marketed device that is not subject to premarket approval. Applicants must compare their 510(k) device to one or more similar devices currently being marketed in the United States to support their substantial equivalency claims. The legally marketed device(s) to which equivalence is drawn is known as the “predicate” device(s). Applicants must submit descriptive data and, when necessary, performance data to establish that a device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device.

Most of our urine-based products are marketed and sold in the Clinical market (in addition to other markets) and therefore, we have obtained 510(k) marketing clearance on our:
 

§ | 9 panel RDS test and our Rapid ONE dipsticks. In addition, the testing strips contained in the RDS InCup are the same as those testing strips contained within the RDS. Therefore, the RDS InCup can be offered in a variety of combinations to meet customer requirements; and

Our oral fluid products have never been marketed or sold to any market that would use the products for diagnosis or treatment, and prior to the receipt of a warning letter from FDA in July 2009, it was our belief, and the belief of our industry, that 510(k) marketing clearance was not required to sell in non-clinical markets, including the Employment/Workplace market. However, after protracted discussions with FDA, we ultimately consented to their jurisdiction in the Employment/Workplace market. As of the date of this report, our oral fluid products are not 510(k) cleared, however, we continue to market and sell OralStat to the forensic market and for export outside the United States.
 
In order to sell our products in Canada, we must comply with ISO 13485:2003, the International Standards Organization’s Directive for Quality Systems for Medical Devices (MDD or Medical Device Directive), and in order to sell our products in the European Union, we must obtain CE marking for our products (in the European Union, a “CE” mark is affixed to the product for easy identification of quality products). Collectively, these standards are similar to FDA regulations, and are a reasonable assurance to the customer that our products are manufactured in a consistent manner to help ensure that quality defect-free goods are produced. As of the date of this report, we have received approval and the right to bear the CE mark on our Rapid Drug Screen, Rapid ONE, Rapid TOX, RDS InCup, Rapid TOX Cup II, Rapid Reader and OralStat. We currently have the following Certificates of Registration in place: I.S. EN ISO 13485:2012, ISO 13485:2003 (CMDCAS) and I.S. EN ISO 9001:2008. All three of these registrations expire on July 31, 2018. We have also obtained the license to sell our RDS, Rapid ONE and Rapid TOX products in Canada through December 31, 2017.
 
The Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) of 1988 established quality standards for laboratory testing to ensure the accuracy, reliability and timeliness of patient test results regardless of where the test was performed. As a result, those using CLIA waived tests are not subject to the more stringent and expensive requirements of moderate or high complexity laboratories. In August 2008, we received our CLIA waiver from the FDA related to our Rapid TOX product line. As of the date of this report, the Rapid TOX is the only ABMC drug-testing product that has been granted a CLIA waiver from the FDA.
 
Due to the nature of the manufacturing of our drug tests, the products we offer through contract manufacture, and the raw materials used, we do not incur any material costs associated with compliance with environmental laws, nor do we experience any material effects of compliance with environmental laws.
 
Research and Development (“R&D”)
 
Our R&D efforts are continually focused on enhancing and/or maintaining the performance and reliability of our drug-testing products. In the year ended December 31, 2016, in addition to the former, efforts in R&D were related to modifications to our Rapid TOX Cup II product line; modifications that will enable us to be slightly more cost-competitive with products made by foreign manufacturers while still maintaining (or further improving) the quality and performance of the product line. Also included in R&D expense are FDA compliance costs, or costs associated with regulatory efforts taken related to the marketing of our products.
 
Our R&D expenditures were $184,000 in the year ended December 31, 2016 and $148,000 in the year ended December 31, 2015. None of the costs incurred in R&D in either the year ended December 31, 2016 or the year ended December 31, 2015 were borne by a customer.

Manufacturing and Employees
 
Our facility in Kinderhook, New York houses assembly and packaging of our products, our warehouse and our administrative offices. We continue to primarily outsource the printing of the plastic components used in our products, and we outsource the manufacture of the plastic components used in our products. We manufacture our own individual test strips and we manufacture test strips for unaffiliated third parties at our R&D and bulk manufacturing facility in Logan Township, New Jersey. An unaffiliated third party manufactured the Rapid Reader products we currently offer; and unaffiliated third parties also manufacture adulteration, alcohol and certain forensic drug testing products we offer.
 
As of December 31, 2016, we had 57 employees, of which 56 were full-time and 1 was part-time. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and we believe our relations with our employees are good.
