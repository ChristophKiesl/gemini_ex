Industry Trends
NE and SE
NE and SE (collectively referred to as Network and Service Enablement (NSE)).
The telecommunications (Telecom) and cable industries are experiencing a major evolution in technology that is likely to last for the next decade as wireless communications expand and evolve from 4G to 5G technology with its promise of greater bandwidth capacity, faster transmission speeds and lower latency response time. 5G is a disruptive technology that is being gradually deployed by service providers using millimeter wave and sub-6 GHz technologies. 5G has broader applications beyond smart mobile devices. 5G’s increased bandwidth capacity and speed, as well as lower latency, should enable numerous devices, referred to as the “Internet of Things” (IOT), to have greater device-to-device connectivity to enable smart homes, smart cities, smart grid, smart and autonomous cars, factory automation and other applications that are yet to be conceptualized.
Wireless communications connectivity at the edge, or the “last mile” or “last hundred yards”, will bring gigahertz speeds and capacity to the home as well as to “all devices” and to “all connected things” (e.g. Cars, Drones, Bots, etc.). The 5G transition is being deployed globally and is expected to be disruptive to businesses, consumers and potentially create new applications and vertical industries. The adoption of 5G also requires increased bandwidth, high speed, and low latency backhaul capability from the network edge to the network core. This requires optical fiber upgrade or buildout as legacy copper line networks are decommissioned. 100GbE optical fiber is being deployed in many metropolitan networks, with the leading-edge networks installing 400GbE optical fiber. In the labs, 800GbE fiber technology is being evaluated for the future next generation optical network. These investments will extend fiber connectivity beyond the office and home and permeate “fiber-to-the-everywhere.”
While new networks are deploying 5G wireless and advanced optical fiber technology, existing network infrastructure that is not otherwise being upgraded is still expected to be modernized with new cable and access technologies. Cable service providers are investing in DOCSIS 3.1 to enhance existing cable networks with higher speed connectivity and bandwidth capacity. Some telecom operators with legacy copper digital subscriber line (DSL) have chosen to extend the useful life of these legacy networks by upgrading to Gfast technology. Many operators, however, have decided to run existing legacy networks until no longer operable and then replace them with new optical fiber. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in global work-office shutdown and Work-From-Home policies among network service providers, NEMs and their related suppliers.  This in turn disrupted and delayed new network construction build out, general network maintenance and new technology development. 
As consumer communication, service provider network operations, and enterprise networks increasingly migrate to the cloud, hyperscale services have become significant drivers of technology innovation, including optical fiber up to 800GbE. 
The scale and complexity of these technology shifts are also challenging service providers to rearchitect their networks, becoming more automated, virtualized and optimized based on real-time intelligence.
The convergence of network technologies requires significant investments from both the traditional carriers (telecom and cable) and cloud service providers. To achieve scale and a profitable return on investment, these CSPs in recent years have consolidated and are expected to continue to consolidate. Traditional service provider capital spending in physical networks has been declining, and this impacts the served available market opportunity for our NSE segment. However, the new cloud service providers and virtualized networks create new NSE opportunities. Our NE and SE products and solutions are well positioned to meet these rapidly changing industry trends, given our technology and products, as well as customer installed base.
NE’s Avionics Communications (AvComm) products, further expand NSE’s Test & Measurement (T&M) opportunity into the government, civil, aerospace and military markets for communications and public safety testing. We also believe military radio test and avionics products are a growth opportunity as defense and public safety department budgets increase significantly due to the ongoing upgrade from analog to digital communications.
OSP
The threat of counterfeiting of banknotes and documents of value is enabled by a broad range of advanced but relatively low-cost imaging technologies and printing tools. With this access, counterfeiters – who range from hobbyists to nation states - have the ability to potentially create simulations of actual documents and products for illicit purposes, creating the need for robust, technically sophisticated and easy to validate anti-counterfeiting features. We have decades of anti-counterfeiting expertise leveraging our Optically Variable Pigment (OVP®), and our Optically Variable Magnetic Pigment (OVMP®) technologies to protect the integrity of banknotes and other high-value documents by delivering optical effects that, on one hand, consumers can easily recognize but on the other hand, counterfeiters find very difficult to reproduce.
In addition to Anti-Counterfeiting technologies, we also provide optical technologies for the 3D sensing, consumer electronics, government, automotive, and industrial markets. For example, we manufacture and sell optical filters for 3D sensing applications that allow consumers to interact with their devices more naturally by enabling electronic devices to accurately measure depth and motion. Our filters play an important role in those applications, separating out ambient light from the incoming data used by sensors to make precise measurements. Notably, our patented low angle shift technology enables our customers to significantly improve the signal-to-noise ratio of their systems and deliver reliable system performance. Through the development of multiple generations of products for 3D sensing and by delivering improved performance and competitive value with each iteration, we believe we have established ourselves as the industry’s leading supplier of high-performance filters enabling depth-sensing systems in consumer electronics. In October 2018, we broadened our portfolio of 3D sensing technologies when we acquired RPC Photonics (RPC), a technology leader in engineered optical diffusers, marketed under the trademark “Engineered DiffusersTM.” Engineered DiffusersTM diffuse the infrared laser light transmitted by a smartphone in 3D sensing applications, enabling reliable system performance while also guarding eye safety. In user facing applications of 3D sensing including facial recognition, our Engineered DiffusersTM enable infrared light to safely impinge on the target, i.e. human facial profile. That light is then reflected back to the 3D Sensor on the smartphone and an image process gathers the target information.
Sales and Marketing
CSPs make up the majority of NE and SE revenues. We also market and sell products to NEMs, OEMs, enterprises, governmental organizations, distributors and strategic partners worldwide. We have a dedicated sales force organized around each of the markets that we serve that works directly with customers’ executive, technical, manufacturing and purchasing personnel to determine design, performance and cost requirements. We are also supported by a worldwide channel community, including our Velocity Solution Partners who support our NE and SE segments.
OSP sales and marketing efforts are targeted primarily toward customers in the consumer electronics, government, industrial, medical and automotive markets. We have a dedicated direct global sales force focused on understanding customers’ requirements and building market awareness and acceptance of our products. Our direct sales force is complemented by a highly trained team of field applications engineers who assist customers in designing, testing and qualifying our products. We market our products and capabilities through attendance at trade shows, the production of promotional webinars, the development of samples and product demonstrations, participation in technical forums, select advertising and by developing customer partnerships.
A high level of support is a critical part of our strategy to develop and maintain long-term collaborative relationships with our customers. We develop innovative products by engaging our customers at the initial design phase and continue to build that relationship as our customers’ needs change and develop. Service and support are provided through our offices and those of our partners worldwide.
Corporate Strategy
Our objective is to continue to be a leading provider in the markets and industries we serve. In support of our business segments, we are pursuing a corporate strategy that we believe will best position us for future opportunities as follows:
•Market leadership in physical and virtualized test and measurement instruments with opportunity to grow market share;
•Market leadership in Anti-Counterfeiting pigments, 3D sensing optical filters and Engineered DiffusersTM;
•Market leadership in 5G wireless, public safety radio and navigation/communication transponder test instruments;
•Increase the benefit from the use of our net operating loss carryforwards (NOL) by improving our profitability organically and inorganically; and
•Greater flexibility in capital structure in support of our strategic plans.
Our near-term strategy, and next transformation phase, will be more focused on growth, both organic and inorganic. We plan to leverage major secular growth trends in 5G Wireless, Fiber and 3D Sensing to achieve higher levels of revenue and profitability.
Our long-term capital allocation strategy, which supports our corporate strategy, is as follows:
•Maintenance and run-rate investments to support operations;
•Organic investments in initiatives to support revenue growth and productivity;
•Return capital to shareholders through share buybacks and execute on capital allocation and debt management strategy; and
•Mergers and acquisitions that are synergistic to company strategy and business segments.
Although we are working to successfully implement our strategy, internal and/or external factors could impact our ability to meet any, or all, of our objectives. These factors are discussed under Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Manufacturing
As of July 3, 2021, we have significant manufacturing facilities for our NE, SE and OSP segments located in China, France, Germany, United Kingdom and the United States. Our most significant contract manufacturing partners are located in China and Mexico.
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
We use various suppliers and contract manufacturers to supply parts and components for the manufacture and support of multiple product lines. Although we intend to establish at least two sources of supply for materials whenever possible, for certain components we have sole or limited source supply arrangements. 
Patents and Proprietary Rights
Intellectual property rights apply to our various products include patents, trade secrets and trademarks. We do not intend to broadly license our intellectual property rights unless we can obtain adequate consideration or enter into acceptable patent cross-license agreements. As of July 3, 2021, we owned approximately 831 U.S. patents and 1,528 foreign patents and have 1,004 patent applications pending throughout the world. The average age of the patents we hold is 9.1 years, which is slightly younger than the midpoint of the average 20-year life of a patent.
Backlog
Due to possible changes in product delivery schedules and cancellation of product orders, and because our sales often reflect orders shipped in the same quarter in which they are received, our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual revenue or the level of orders for any succeeding period.
Seasonality
Our business is seasonal, as is typical for our competitors and many large companies. For NSE, revenue is typically higher in the second and fourth fiscal quarter, all else being equal. There is typically a modest end of calendar year customer spending budget flush that benefits our second fiscal quarter. Telecom and cable spending budgets are typically set at the start of a new calendar year, thus with all else being equal, our third fiscal quarter is NSE’s weakest revenue quarter with spending release benefiting our fourth fiscal quarter. For our OSP business, given our recent exposure to the consumer market, namely our 3D Sensing products into the smart phone market, OSP revenue is expected to be seasonally higher in the first and second fiscal quarter followed by seasonal demand declines in the third and fourth fiscal quarters.
Human Capital Management
As of July 3, 2021, we had approximately 3,600 employees worldwide representing more than 30 self-identified nationalities working across approximately 30 countries. VIAVI is committed to promoting and maintaining a diverse and inclusive work environment and offering equal opportunities to everyone.

Our compensation and benefit programs are designed to recognize our employees' individual performance and contributions to our business results, including competitive base salaries and variable pay for all employees, share-based equity award grants, health and welfare benefits, time-off, development programs and training, and opportunities to give back to our communities. We provide talent rewards that are competitive in the marketplace. We support equal pay for equal work, pay transparency as well as all federal anti-discrimination laws applicable to employment, including those within Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. 
Health and Safety
VIAVI is committed to maintaining an inclusive, supportive, safe and healthy work environment where our employees can thrive. We strictly comply with all applicable health and safety regulations, offer robust training to our employees on health and safety matters, maintain controls and proper disposal of hazardous materials and track workplace incidents and injuries. We maintain and regularly update emergency and disaster recovery plans.
While faced with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we have come together to institute a set of global policies, a global COVID-19 Committee at the executive level, regional and local Pandemic Response Teams, Return to Work guidelines and flexible workplace practices to help our employees and their families stay healthy and safely navigate the challenging and changing environment. 
Environmental, Social and Governance
All stakeholders are essential to our business, including stockholders, customers, suppliers, employees, communities as well as the environment and society. We are working on making our workforce more inclusive, our business more sustainable, and our communities more engaged by maintaining strong environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices. We detail our overall ESG strategy and progress on our ESG web page and in our annual Corporate Social Responsibility Report, which can both be found at www.viavisolutions.com/csr.
Information Security
Information security is the responsibility of our Information Security team, overseen by the Chief Information Security Officer. We leverage a combination of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework, International Organization for Standardization and Center for Internet Security best practice standards to measure security posture, deliver risk management and provide effective security controls.
Our information security practices include development, implementation, and improvement of policies and procedures to safeguard information and ensure availability of critical data and systems. Our Information Security team conducts annual information security awareness training for employees involved in our systems and processes that handle customer data and audits of our systems and enhanced training for specialized personnel. Our program further includes review and assessment by external, independent third-parties, who assess and report on our internal incident response preparedness and help identify areas for continued focus and improvement.
As set forth in its charter, our Audit Committee, comprised fully of independent directors, is responsible for oversight of risk, including cybersecurity and information security risk. Our Chief Information Security Officer delivers quarterly reports and updates to the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee regularly briefs the full Board on these matters, and the Board receives regular updates on the status of the Information Security Program, including but not limited to relevant cyber threats, roadmap and key initiative updates, and the management of information security risk.
