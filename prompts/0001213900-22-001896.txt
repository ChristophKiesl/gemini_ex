Overview



Gushen, Inc., a Nevada corporation, (“we”, “us” or “the Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on March 9, 2015.



The Company was originally set up as a holding company operating through its wholly owned subsidiary, Gushen Holding Limited, to provide managerial and IT support to start-ups as well as SME (small and medium enterprises) in Hong Kong and Malaysia to assist them in their early stages of operations as they expand and grow their own company. On August 5, 2016, the Company acquired a Hong Kong company, Gushen Credit Limited, with a money lender license registered according to Cap163 Money Lenders Ordinance of Hong Kong. Due to the keen competition and high rental expense in Hong Kong, on April 27, 2017, the Company decided to dispose of the asset for a consideration of $105,000 and ceased the business in Hong Kong. Thereafter, the Company did not open for business or generate any revenue from November 2017 to March 2020, making it dormant.



On March 27, 2020, as a result of a custodianship in Clark County, Nevada, Custodian Ventures, LLC was appointed custodian of Gushen Inc. David Lazar, a private investor and managing member of Custodian Ventures, LLC (together with David Lazar, the “Custodian”), was appointed as the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, President, Secretary, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors. The Custodian was tasked to solicit investment on behalf of the Company.



On December 9, 2020, the Company, Custodian, and certain investors (“Purchasers”) entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”), pursuant to which the Purchasers acquired 30 million shares of Series A preferred stock (the “Preferred A Shares”), each convertible into 10 shares of Common Stock, from Custodian for an aggregate purchase price of $525,000. In connection with the SPA, the Company, Custodian, and Gushen Holding Limited entered into a spin-off agreement, pursuant to which the Custodian acquired all issued and outstanding stock of Gushen Holdings Limited at a minimal purchase price of $1. Thereafter, the Company no longer retains any interest in Gushen Holding Limited.



On July 30, 2021, the Company and Dyckmanst Limited, a British Virgin Islands company (“Dyckmanst Limited”), and all shareholders of Dyckmanst Limited entered into a share exchange agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”), pursuant to which the Company acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding equity securities of Dyckmanst Limited in exchange for 381,600,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Common Stock”) of the Company (the “Share Exchange”). Immediately prior to the closing of the Share Exchange, two existing holders of aggregated 30,000,000 shares of Series A preferred stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Preferred Stock”) delivered 29,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock to the Company for cancellation (“the “Cancellation of Certain Preferred Stock”), each Preferred Stock is convertible into 10 shares of Common Stock. As a result, shareholders of Dyckmanst Limited collectively control 90.72% voting power of the Company on as converted basis, with respect to all of the shares of common stock and preferred stock, voting as a single class, with each share of common stock entitles to 1 vote and each share of preferred stock entitles to 10 votes.



As a result of the Share exchange, the Company assumes the business of Dyckmanst Limited. Through certain overseas subsidiaries and contractual arrangements, the Company is able to consolidate the financial results of Beijing Zhuoxin Education Technology Co., Ltd. (“Zhuoxun Beijing”) and its subsidiaries in accordance with US GAAP as the primary beneficiary.

Going Concern



The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business are dependent on, among other things, the Company’s ability to operate profitably, to generate cash flows from operations, and to pursue financing arrangements to support its working capital requirements.



In assessing the Company’s liquidity, the Company monitors and analyzes its cash and cash equivalents and its operating and capital expenditure commitments. The Company’s liquidity needs are to meet its working capital requirements, operating expenses and capital expenditure obligations. As of September 30, 2021, the Company’s current liabilities exceeded the current assets by $5,373,363, its accumulated deficit was $423,276 and the Company has incurred losses during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 and 2020. None of the Company’s stockholders, officers or directors, or third parties, are under any obligation to advance us funds, or to invest in us. Accordingly, we may not be able to obtain additional financing. If we are unable to raise additional capital, we may be required to take additional measures to conserve liquidity, which could include, but not necessarily be limited to, curtailing operations, suspending the pursuit of our business plan, and reducing overhead expenses. We cannot provide any assurance that new financing will be available to us on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.



These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
