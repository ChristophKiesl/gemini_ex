Overview
 
We are a biotechnology company focused on delivering innovative precision therapies to improve the lives of patients and families battling genetically-driven cardiovascular and mechanistically-related diseases. Our initial focus is on the treatment of BCL2-associated athanogene 3 (BAG3) mutation-associated dilated cardiomyopathy ("DCM") ("BAG3 DCM"). BAG3 DCM is a heritable rare disease that leads to early onset, rapidly progressing heart failure and significant mortality and morbidity. Our lead product candidate, REN-001, is a recombinant adeno-associated virus ("AAV") 9-based gene therapy designed to deliver a fully functional BAG3 gene to augment BAG3 protein levels in cardiomyocytes and slow or halt progression of BAG3 DCM. BAG3 is a multifunctional, 575-amino acid protein that plays vital roles in ensuring cardiomyocyte function and homeostasis by: i) regulating cardiomyocyte contraction by interacting with the β1-adrenergic receptor and the L-type Ca2+ channel; ii) maintaining structural integrity of the sarcomere; iii) regulating protein quality control; and iv) inhibiting apoptosis by interacting with Bcl-2. Reductions in the level of BAG3 have been associated with the onset of severe cardiac dysfunction and heart failure in a variety of preclinical and clinical settings.

We believe that development of a BAG3 gene replacement therapy for DCM patients who carry BAG3 gene mutations has the potential to prevent progression of DCM and associated heart failure. We believe diseases caused by monogenic defects are especially tractable targets for gene therapies. Recently approved therapies have successfully utilized AAV as a vehicle to deliver genes to patients suffering from monogenic diseases and there are many additional ongoing clinical development programs utilizing AAV-based gene therapies to address these diseases.

We believe we are the first company to apply AAV technology to patients with DCM specifically due to mutations in the BAG3 gene. REN-001 utilizes an AAV9 vector intended to deliver a healthy version of the BAG3 gene to produce functional BAG3 protein in patients with genetic mutations that cause insufficient levels of functional BAG3 protein. This approach has shown promise in multiple preclinical models, demonstrating production of functional BAG3 protein and improvement in cardiac function.

We anticipate submitting an Investigational New Drug ("IND") application in connection with our lead product candidate, REN-001, in the second half of 2022, and plan to initiate a phase I/II clinical trial of REN-001 in patients with BAG3 DCM if our IND application is accepted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”).
 


Our Strategy

We intend to build upon our expertise in BAG3-mediated disease to develop a pipeline of BAG3-based therapies for diseases in areas of high unmet medical need associated with mutations in the BAG3 gene. Key elements of our strategy include:
•Advancing our lead product candidate, REN-001, through IND-enabling activities, clinical trials and regulatory approval. We intend to advance the clinical development of our lead product candidate, REN-001, and, if approved by the FDA, commercialize REN-001 for the rare disease indication BAG3-associated DCM. We anticipate submission of an IND for REN-001 in the second half of 2022 and the subsequent commencement of clinical trials. We are seeking to obtain regulatory designations, such as Orphan Drug Designation and Fast Track Designation, to facilitate the development of REN-001 to help bring REN-001 to patients in an expedited manner. 
 •Leveraging our deep understanding of BAG3 biology. Our vision is to develop gene therapies for BAG3-associated diseases with high unmet medical need. Our initial focus is on the treatment of BAG3 DCM, a heritable rare disease that leads to early onset, rapidly progressing heart failure and significant mortality and morbidity. Our lead product candidate, REN-001, is a recombinant AAV9-based gene therapy designed to deliver a fully functional BAG3 gene to augment BAG3 protein levels in cardiomyocytes and slow or halt progression of BAG3 DCM. We also intend to leverage our expertise in BAG3 biology to investigate the utility of BAG3 gene therapy for additional pipeline product opportunities across other potential cardiovascular and CNS indications. Our founder, Arthur M. Feldman, M.D., Ph.D., the Laura H. Carnell Professor of Medicine at the Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University, is a highly regarded cardiovascular scientist and pre-eminent expert on the role of BAG3 in human disease. We intend to leverage Dr. Feldman’s expertise to advance our lead product candidate, REN-001, as well as to develop a research pipeline of additional product candidates. We believe that through our licensed intellectual property, specifically patents for BAG3 gene therapy through multiple routes of administration and in multiple indications, we have developed substantial barriers to entry. 
 •Overcoming challenges of existing gene therapy approaches. We intend to utilize leading AAV technology to overcome challenges present in current gene therapy approaches. Previously conducted third-party clinical trials utilizing gene therapy techniques to treat heart disease have failed to show long term beneficial effects in patients with heart failure. We believe these failures are due to a number of possibilities, including the use of a vector that is not cardiac tropic, or ineffective delivery of the vector to the target tissue. Our therapeutic approach is designed to address these shortcomings, including through use of the AAV9, an AAV serotype with a unique ability to transduce cardiovascular cells. AAV9 has been widely characterized across numerous preclinical and clinical studies and has a well-characterized biodistribution, safety, tolerability and efficacy profile. In addition, our lead product candidate, REN-001, utilizes a local intracoronary vector delivery approach with the intended goal of improved cardiac uptake and methods to maximize dwell time in the cardiac circulation. 
 •Utilizing what we believe is a superior local delivery approach with the potential to reduce total vector burden and manufacturing costs. We plan on utilizing retrograde coronary sinus infusion ("RCSI") to deliver our lead product candidate, REN-001 for BAG3-associated DCM. This method of local delivery has been shown to be effective at transducing cardiac tissue in preclinical pig models. Specifically, RCSI showed improved transduction in the heart relative to other intracoronary delivery methods. RCSI delivery is expected to allow for a lower total dose per patient relative to intravenous ("IV") delivery. Advantages of a lower total dose per patient include the potential for decreased risk of adverse events related to total vector exposure and the potential for reduced manufacturing cost.

Targeting High Unmet Need Cardiovascular Disease
    Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Heart Failure ("HF"), a clinical condition in which the output of blood from the heart is insufficient to meet the metabolic demands of the body, is a major contributor to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. HF affects over 15 million people in the United States and in the European Economic Area (the "EEA"). We believe the number of people with heart failure in the United States and EEA is expected to increase in the next decade due to an aging population and increasing prevalence of risk factors for cardiovascular disease, including obesity and diabetes. Common symptoms and signs of heart failure include shortness of breath, fatigue and swelling of the ankles, feet, legs, abdomen and veins in the neck. When HF symptoms become severe, the patient is referred to as having acute decompensated HF ("ADHF"), a life-threatening event. Currently, among the approximately 6 million HF patients in the US, there are approximately one million primary HF-related hospitalizations in the United States each year. The large majority of these hospitalizations are for ADHF. Despite recent advances in HF therapy, approximately half of patients hospitalized with ADHF are readmitted within 6 months, an example of the severe unmet need for this condition.
    Clinicians generally segment the HF patient population based on the contractility of the major pumping chamber of the heart, the left ventricle ("LV"). The most commonly used measure of LV contractility is ejection fraction ("EF"). HF patients with normal LV contractility (≥50%) are referred to as having HF with preserved LVEF ("HFpEF"), while those with an LVEF < 40% are referred to as having HF with reduced LVEF ("HfrEF"). A relatively small number of HF patients have an LVEF 40-49% and are described as having HF with midrange EF ("HfmrEF"). Scientific society treatment guidelines have established different treatment algorithms for the different HF patient segments.
    DCM represents a segment of the HFrEF population with primary disease of the myocardium (heart muscle), and the primary cause of cardiac dysfunction in approximately 20-25% of HFrEF patients.
   A familial association of DCM can be identified in 20-50% of DCM patients, with up to 40% of familial patients having an identifiable genetic cause. Mutations in the BAG3 gene are among the more common pathogenic genetic variants observed in familial DCM and these variants are highly penetrant, with approximately 80% of individuals with disease-causing genetic variants in the BAG3 gene developing DCM at > 40 years of age. We estimate that the prevalence of BAG3-associated DCM in the United States to be as many as 30,000 individuals, representing an orphan disease population. Currently, DCM patients with a BAG3 mutation are treated with the standard of care for heart failure, which include angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, neprilysin inhibitors, beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists, or beta-blockers, aldosterone antagonists and/or diuretics, along with certain lifestyle changes, and do not address the underlying cause of disease. Patients who meet specific parameters may also undergo placement of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator, a cardiac resynchronization device or a combination of the two. There is no current therapy directly targeting the underlying mechanism of BAG3 associated DCM, and patients diagnosed with BAG3 associated DCM appear to progress to end-stage heart failure and death more rapidly than patients with DCM not associated with BAG3 variants. For example, approximately 19% of patients with BAG3 DCM require mechanical cardiac support, heart transplant, or have HF-related death at 12 months after diagnosis, nearly twice the rate of similarly staged non-BAG3 DCM patients.
 
REN-001 (AAV9-BAG3): Our Lead Product Candidate
 
Overview

Our lead product candidate, REN-001, is an AAV9 vector-based gene therapy designed to treat BAG-3 associated DCM through delivery of a human BAG3 gene to express a fully functional human BAG3 protein in transduced cells. After transducing the cardiomyocyte, the vector translocates into the nucleus, where the capsid proteins dissociate, allowing the cell’s native expression machinery to initiate transcription of the BAG3 gene. Unlike wild-type AAVs, REN-001 lacks an S1 domain, which significantly limits the potential for the vector genome to integrate into the host chromosome. Instead, the gene has the potential to remain in the nucleus as episomal DNA.
 
Third-party studies have demonstrated that recombinant AAV-delivered episomal DNA persists in the nucleus of transfected non-proliferating cells for up to several years. This suggests that a single dose of REN-001 could provide prolonged BAG3 gene replacement in haploinsufficient cells transduced by the vector. Following transcription and translation of the BAG3 gene, the function of the BAG3 protein is expected to be restored, and disease progression has the potential to be halted or significantly slowed.

We are currently exploring the delivery of REN-001 through RCSI and anticipate submitting an IND for REN-001 in the second half of 2022.



The AAV9-BAG3 gene vector

The AAV9-BAG3 gene vector utilized in REN-001 is comprised of the four exons of the human BAG3 gene, two AAV2 inverted terminal repeat ("ITR"), segments, a CMV promoter, and the three AAV9 cap proteins VP1, VP2, and VP3 (Figure 1).
   
   
Figure 1: The entire AAV9-BAG3 vector genome is approximately 6,048 bases in length. Each ITR — derived from the AAV2 genome — is 143 bases, and the CMV and BAG3genes are 584 and 1,728 bases in length, respectively. The capsid is comprised of VP1, VP2, and VP3 cap proteins from the AAV9 genome.

   The AAV9-BAG3 gene vector utilized in REN-001 is designed to be administered to patients through RCSI. AAV9-BAG3 is not cleared after a first pass via the mononuclear phagocyte system but rather circulates for up to multiple days, albeit at a much lower concentration relative to the concentration in the coronary circulation at the time of dosing. After transducing the cardiomyocyte, AAV9-BAG3 will translocate into the nucleus, where the capsid proteins will dissociate, allowing the cell’s native expression machinery to initiate transcription of the BAG3 gene.

Following transcription and translation of the BAG3 gene, we believe the function of the BAG3 protein will be restored, (including the maintenance of the sarcomeres, normalization of protein quality control, inhibition of programmed cell death, and improved responsiveness to adrenergic signals) and disease progression is expected to be halted or significantly slowed.

Safety considerations of AAV9-BAG3 administration

Prior gene therapy programs in and outside the cardiac space have raised safety concerns. Some BAG3-haploinsufficient patients will have already developed serum immunoglobulin G ("IgG") and neutralizing factors to the VP1, VP2, and/or VP3 cap proteins of the AAV9 serotype and will not be eligible for an AAV-related gene therapy.

It is of critical importance that safety be the primary concern of any study of gene therapy. Because pre-existing antibodies remain a significant problem in the use of gene therapy, we will screen and exclude BAG3-haploinsufficient patients from our clinical development studies and post-approval use in whom the titer of IgG antibodies exceeds an acceptable level. Furthermore, during the course of our preclinical studies, we will work with national experts to design standard protocols for treating patients who develop signs of inflammation after dosing.

Gene therapy also carries a risk of transduction into off-target tissues. One of the key benefits of adeno- associated viral vectors is their tropism for specific tissues. AAV9 was selected for REN-001 because of its tropism for cardiac tissue. Studies in mice and a pilot study in pigs demonstrate that our AAV9-BAG3 results in robust expression in the heart with little expression in the kidney, lung or liver.

A safety concern with all AAV-based gene therapy is that AAV administration could lead to the integration of the gene into the target cell’s genome. AAV vectors lacking an S1 domain transduce their genes into episomal DNA, rather than integrating into the chromosome. Because episomal DNA is not replicated during mitosis, the daughter cells will not contain the transduced genetic sequences. This is important in the context of BAG3 gene therapy. BAG3 is not oncogenic, as there is no evidence to date that shows it can cause a non-malignant cell to transform into a malignant cell. However, BAG3 has been shown to enhance migration, adhesion and insensitivity to chemotherapy when over-expressed in cancer cells. Therefore, there is a theoretical risk that a tumor will have increased metastasis if it over-expresses BAG3. We believe REN-001 mitigates this possibility by utilizing an AAV vector that lacks the S1 domain.


Across all gene therapy programs, regardless of the specificity of the vector and the promoter selected, there is at least a 0.01%-1% risk of integration as a percentage of vectors that successfully transduce and translocate into the nucleus. Due to random integration, it is unlikely that the gene will transcribe. If, however, the placement of the BAG3 gene is next to a universal enhancer, there is a chance of expression. It is also a possibility that the BAG3 gene could disrupt an otherwise healthy gene, potentially resulting in a loss-of-function mutation or other phenotypic abnormalities. Because this integration is restricted to each individual transfected cell, there is no test to identify that the event has occurred, and all patients who undergo gene therapy will require careful long-term follow-up.
 
Preclinical research and development for REN-001
 
We are currently conducting preclinical studies exploring the ability of a BAG3 gene therapy to treat patients suffering from DCM caused by BAG3 haploinsufficiency. In conducting preclinical research in this field to generate data validating this novel therapeutic approach, animal studies have been completed in several heart failure disease models, including studies involving mice subjected to trans-aortic constriction, mice suffering from left ventricular dysfunction following a myocardial infarction ("MI"), mice with left ventricular dysfunction post-ischemia and reperfusion, and large animal studies in pigs suffering from left ventricular dysfunction following an MI.

Figure 2: BAG3 protein levels in cardiac tissue from failing hearts is decreased to 50% of normal levels.



BAG3 protein levels in all heart failure models we studied, as well as other research groups, show that in failing hearts there is a decrease in BAG3 protein by approximately 50% (Figure 2). Administration of REN-001 to post-MI mice led to an increase in BAG3 cardiac protein levels bringing them up to ~70% of levels seen in non-failing hearts. This increase in BAG3 protein levels resulted in a significant functional increase as measured by ejection fraction.

Additionally, we have studied the efficacy of AAV9-BAG3 treatment in a BAG3-haploinsufficient mouse model of DCM, as well as a pilot study in a pig MI model. To further characterize BAG3 biology, we have conducted numerous studies evaluating the mechanism of action of the BAG3 protein in the cardiomyocyte.



Completed preclinical studies of REN-001

REN-001 has been studied in multiple preclinical animal models of heart failure. These studies have demonstrated the ability of REN-001 to induce increased expression of BAG3 protein and to improve cardiac function.

BAG3 haploinsufficient mouse model

To test the impact of AAV9-BAG3 on left ventricle, ("LV") function, mice with haploinsufficiency of BAG3 were injected with either AAV9-BAG3 or with AAV9-GFP (control). The mice were then observed for six weeks, after which biomarkers and proteins that may impact the pathophysiology of BAG3 depletion were measured. AAV9-BAG3 was able to restore normal LV function in BAG3 haploinsufficient mice, as illustrated below (Figure 3).



Figure 3: Ejection fraction ("EF") measurements of wild-type BAG3 and GFP transduction into haploinsufficient and control mice (* p=0.04, 0.01, and 0.003 respectively at 2, 4 and 6 weeks for +/-GFP vs. +/-WtBAG3).

Post-myocardial infarction (MI) mouse model

To test the effects of retro-orbital injection of AAV9-BAG3, eight-week old male c57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned to undergo either an induction of an MI by left coronary artery ligation that led to a significant reduction in LV function or a sham procedure. Mice in each group were randomized to receive either gene therapy with BAG3 or with GFP (MI-AAV9-BAG3, n=13, MI-AAV9-GFP, n=12, Sham-AAV9-BAG3, n=12, Sham- AAV9-GFP, n=14) 1 week after surgery. Left ventricular function across study groups was assessed using echocardiography. As illustrated below, AAV9-BAG3 significantly improved LV performance when compared with the AAV9-GFP control. Furthermore, AAV9-BAG3 had no effect on LV performance in mice in the sham arm, demonstrating that BAG3 levels are precisely regulated under normal conditions (Figure 4).

(Right) LVEF measurements for individual mice at the time of sacrifice (* p <0.0001,  p < 0.0001).


Trans-aortic constriction (TAC) mouse model

To test the effects of AAV9-BAG3 on LV function in mice with TAC, a ligature was tied over the ascending aorta of mice, with surgical consistency being assessed by constricting the aorta over a needle and then evaluating the subsequent obstruction to forward flow setting limits for the variation in trans-constriction pressures. Trans-aortic pressures were measured in all animals to ensure that there was little variation from animal to animal. The experimental paradigm included wild-type mice receiving AAV9-BAG3 or AAV9-GFP, and post-TAC mice receiving AAV9-BAG3 or AAV9-GFP. Dosing occurred at week 9 with a dose of 1x1012 vectors. Functional parameters were measured bi-weekly via echocardiography. As illustrated below, this TAC procedure resulted in lower relative levels of BAG3 expression compared to controls, and treatment with AAV9-BAG3 at 9 weeks following TAC resulted in significant improvements in functional measures of the LV (Figure 5).

(Right) Fractional shortening percentage measurements over the course of sham or TAC surgical procedure and AAV9-BAG3 or AAV9-GFP administration. Note: y-axis does not extend to 0% (p=0.001).

Post-myocardial infarction (MI) pig model

We evaluated the MI pig model in a pilot study to evaluate the reproducibility of the infarcted phenotype in this model, the method of retrograde delivery of REN-001, and the transduction efficiency and efficacy of REN-001 in a large animal model. In order to be included in the study, pigs were required to be free of AAV neutralizing antibodies throughout the study and demonstrate a reduced LVEF post-infarction. Six infarcted Yucatan pigs were treated with a single dose of REN-001, and four were treated with vehicle, through RCSI at two weeks post-MI. The pigs were then followed for an additional six weeks before being sacrificed and assessed for BAG3 protein levels in cardiac tissue. Cardiac function was also assessed pre-MI, and at two and six weeks post-MI.

At the time of injection (two weeks post-MI), four of the six animals in the treatment group and four of the four animals in the vehicle control group had developed neutralizing antibodies. Additionally, of the two animals in the treatment group that did not develop neutralizing antibodies, one did not have a sufficient decline in LVEF post-MI to meet the study inclusion criteria. Thus, only one of the six animals in the treatment group met the study inclusion criteria. For this animal, REN-001 treatment resulted in diffuse BAG3 transgene expression in the cardiac tissue and improvement in LVEF. In the vehicle control group, one pig did not have a sufficient decline in EF to meet the study inclusion criteria, two pigs had an LVEF that continued to decline and one pig had improved LVEF at the conclusion of the study. Due to the challenges with neutralizing antibodies and the variability of the infarct procedure in these animals, we concluded that the MI pig model is not a reliable, reproducible animal model for further assessment of transduction efficiency and efficacy studies. The MI pig model is no longer being used for REN-001 efficacy studies. All further large animal studies are being conducted in normal Yucatan pigs to optimize intracoronary dosing and assess biodistribution. These conclusions do not impact the ongoing preclinical development plan for REN-001 which includes expression and efficacy studies in the BAG3 haploinsufficient mouse model coupled with a GLP toxicology and biodistribution study in normal Yucatan pigs as presented to the FDA in the Pre-IND briefing package.

AAV9-GFP delivery and transduction efficiency in normal Yucatan pigs

To compare antegrade vs. retrograde delivery of AAV9-GFP and to assess AAV transduction efficacy in cardiac tissue, eight non-infarcted Yucatan pigs were given an infusion of a single low dose AAV9-GFP (1x1013 vg, n=4), high dose AAV9-GFP (5x1013 vg, n=2) or vehicle (n=2). Within each treatment group, half of the pigs received antegrade infusion of AAV9-GFP while the other half received RCSI of AAV9-GFP. All of the pigs were assessed for AAV transduction in cardiac tissue via GFP reporter gene four weeks post-infusion.

Retrograde delivery of AAV9-GFP was more effective in transducing cardiac tissue than antegrade delivery. The 5x1013 vg dose of AAV9-GFP through RCSI resulted in clear expression of AAV9-GFP in cardiac tissue four weeks post treatment. Antegrade delivery of AAV9-GFP at the 5x1013 vg dose did not yield a similar level of expression. No expression was observed in animals treated with 1x1013 vg dose of AAV9-GFP through either delivery method four weeks post treatment.

REN-001 delivery via RCSI and transduction efficiency in normal Yucatan pigs
 
To evaluate the transduction efficiency of REN-001 administered via RCSI, a total of seven non-infarcted Yucatan pigs were administered REN-001 at multiple doses (n=4 for low-dose; n=2 for medium dose; n=1 for high dose). We quantified transduction as viral genomes per cardiomyocyte (CM), assuming 8 nuclei in each CM, and 18 tissue sections were analyzed per heart. As illustrated below, delivery of REN-001 via RCSI resulted in successful cardiac transduction above a key vector copy number ("VCN") threshold at doses less than 1x1013 vector genomes (vg) per kilogram (Figure 6).



Figure 6: Viral genomes per cardiomyocyte are shown as the mean (+SEM) of 18 tissue sections taken per heart (excluding values >3 standard deviations from the mean) and assume 8 nuclei in each cardiomyocyte (Velayuthan et al., J Mol Cell Cardiology, 2020); number of animals/group: low dose (n=4), medium dose (n=2) and high dose (n=1). All doses were <1x1013 vg/kg.
 
No safety issues were detected in this preclinical study. Results of this preclinical pilot study informed the design of our ongoing GLP toxicology and biodistribution IND-enabling study.
 


Ongoing preclinical studies of REN-001

We have several preclinical studies of REN-001 currently in progress to further evaluate AAV9 transduction efficiency, safety, and efficacy in mouse and pig models. These studies include a dose-ranging efficacy study, a durability of effect study, and a natural history study (including survival analysis), each in BAG3 haploinsufficient mice, which continue to progress at the Feldman laboratory at Temple pursuant to the Temple SRA, as defined below. Preliminary data from our ongoing natural history study has demonstrated an impaired survival phenotype, alongside left ventricular dilation and cardiac function decline, findings that are consistent with several hallmark characteristics of DCM seen clinically in patients. These new data have been leveraged to optimize the design of our ongoing dose-ranging study.
 
Additionally, our good laboratory practice (“GLP”) toxicology and biodistribution study in normal Yucatan pigs using the RCSI route of administration is ongoing and has completed dosing.

We anticipate the availability of key data from our ongoing preclinical studies to support an IND submission in the second half of 2022.

Clinical Development Plan for REN-001

We completed a Type B Pre-IND meeting with the FDA on June 16, 2020 to obtain FDA feedback on REN-001. We anticipate submitting an IND for REN-001 in the second half of 2022, and plan to initiate a phase I/II clinical trial of REN-001 in patients with BAG3-associated DCM if our IND submission is accepted by the FDA. We expect the phase I/II clinical trial will be conducted in two sequential parts consisting of dose escalation and dose expansion components. The dose escalation part will enroll cohorts of three to six subjects to identify a preferred dose and be followed by a dose expansion cohort to further explore the safety, tolerability and preliminary evidence of efficacy at the preferred dose. This will be an open label study with the goal of evaluating the safety and efficacy of REN-001. Safety and tolerability will be evaluated based on assessment of frequency and severity measures of adverse events and series of adverse events. Efficacy will be evaluated based on measures of cardiac structure and function, circulating biomarkers, and patient functional capacity and quality of life.

We will consult with the FDA following completion of the phase I/II clinical trial to determine the need for, and optimal design of, future clinical trials.

Our preclinical strategy includes plans to advance earlier stage research programs where we believe our BAG3 gene therapy technology has the potential to provide meaningful clinical benefit for diseases in areas of high unmet medical need.

See Note 9 of the Notes to Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.
Manufacturing
 
Gene therapy manufacturing is a critical factor in the successful development and commercialization of novel gene medicines. We do not currently own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities for the production of preclinical, clinical, or commercial quantities of REN-001, or any other product candidate. We currently depend on a limited number of third-party contract development and manufacturing organizations ("CDMOs") for all of our requirements of raw materials, drug substance and drug product for our preclinical research and clinical supply of REN-001. We are not currently party to any long-term agreements with our current CDMOs. We intend to rely on CDMOs for clinical and commercial manufacturing of REN-001, as well as the clinical and commercial manufacturing of our other product candidates and any other product candidates that we may identify in the future. Although we rely on CDMOs, we have employees and third-party consultants with extensive manufacturing experience to oversee the relationships with our contract manufacturers.
Competition
 
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We are currently developing REN-001, our AAV9-based gene therapy designed to treat BAG-3 associated DCM. There are many other companies, both public and private, that are actively engaged in discovery, development, and commercializing products and technologies that may compete with our drug candidate, REN-001, or any other drug candidate we may develop. Our products, if approved, will compete with novel therapies developed by biopharmaceutical companies, academic research institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions, in addition to standard of care treatments. Our competitors compete with us on the level of the technologies employed, or on the level of development of product candidates. In addition, many small biotechnology companies have formed collaborations with large, established companies to obtain support for their research, development and commercialization of products or combine several treatment approaches to develop longer lasting or more efficacious treatments that may potentially directly compete with our current or future product candidates. We anticipate that we will continue to face increasing competition as new therapies and combinations thereof, technologies, and data emerge within the field of gene therapy and, furthermore, within the treatment of heart failure.

Many of our competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical, and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of treatments, and the commercialization of those treatments. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining approval for treatments and achieving widespread market acceptance.

In the field of cardiomyopathy drug development, we are aware of several companies that may compete with us, including, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Bayer AG, BioMarin Pharmaceutical, BridgeBio Pharma, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Cytokinetics, DiNAQOR AG, Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Sardocor Corp., Skyline Therapeutics, Tenaya Therapeutics and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited. We are also aware of other companies developing gene therapies targeting heart failure, however, to the best of our knowledge, none of these company's' programs are aimed directly at increasing BAG3 expression and we are not aware of any formally disclosed programs actively under development for BAG3 DCM. Nevertheless, these companies may compete with us in recruiting human capital and securing licenses to complementary technologies that may be critical to the success of our business. They also compete with us for potential funding from the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. There may be other companies pursuing therapeutic candidates from which we may face current or future competition.
 
Our commercial potential could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for our products, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market or make our development more complicated. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our programs are likely to be efficacy, safety, and convenience.

These competitors may also vie for a similar pool of qualified scientific and management talent, sites and patient populations for clinical trials, as well as for technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our products.

Risks related to our competitors and our competitive position are discussed in further detail in the section entitled “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 


Intellectual Property
 
We strive to protect our product candidates and BAG3 technology through a variety of methods, including seeking and maintaining patent rights intended to cover our BAG3 technology, its compositions, the methods of use and processes for their manufacture, and any other inventions that may be commercially important to the development of our business. We may also rely on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. In addition, we may rely on trade secrets and know-how that may be important to the development of our business.

We are actively building our intellectual property portfolio around our product candidates and discovery programs, primarily based on our licensed intellectual property. As of March 15, 2022, we own or exclusively license a total of 39 pending patent applications of which there are 36 pending applications and one granted U.S. patent, one granted Japanese patent and one granted European patent license from Temple. In September 2021, an opposition was filed against the European patent. We responded in January 2022 rebutting all grounds of the opponent’s opposition. Of the 36 pending in-licensed patent applications, there are four U.S. utility applications, one pending U.S. provisional application and 31 pending ex-U.S. patent applications. In addition, we own one pending U.S. provisional application and jointly own two pending U.S. provisional applications with Temple. Collectively, these patent rights relate to various aspects of our BAG3 product candidates and technology. We expect to file additional patent applications in support of current and future product candidates.
 
The term of individual patents depends upon the laws of the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing of a non-provisional patent application. However, the term of United States patents may be extended for delays incurred due to compliance with the FDA requirements or by delays encountered during prosecution that are caused by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO"). For example, for drugs that are regulated by the FDA under the Hatch-Waxman Act, it is permitted to extend the term of a patent that covers such drug for up to five years beyond the normal expiration date of the patent. In the future, if and when our product candidates receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those product candidates. We intend to seek patent term extensions to any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available; however, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the USPTO and FDA, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions. The actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent. For this and more comprehensive risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
   
Patents and pending patent applications

Of the 39 pending patent applications, there are eight families. One application family licensed from Temple relates to the treatment of heart failure in patients with reduced BAG3 expression and reduced EF. The term of any patent that issues from these applications will expire in 2035, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustment or patent term extension, if applicable. Three application families licensed from Temple relate to the use of BAG3 for increasing cardiac contractility in patients with heart failure due to reduced EF, the treatment of ischemia/reperfusion injury, and the treatment of subpopulations of individuals with BAG3 genetic variants that cause worsening outcomes in dilated cardiomyopathy. The term of any patent that issues from applications within these families will expire in 2036, 2037 and 2039 respectively, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustment or patent term extension, if applicable.

Three other application families either co-owned with or licensed from Temple relate to treatment of additional diseases. One application family we own relates to cardiac administration of therapeutics. The term of any patent that issues from applications in these families will expire in 2042, excluding any additional term for patent term adjustment or patent term extension, if applicable.

Trademarks and pending trademark applications

We intend to file applications for trademark registrations in connection with our approved products in jurisdictions relevant to our business plans. We own registered trademarks and trademark applications in the U.S., European Union, U.K, Canada, Japan, China and Israel that are directed to our name and logo covering services provided in connection with gene therapy.



Trade secrets

We may rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. We take steps to protect our confidential and proprietary information as trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements under the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information concerning our business or financial affairs developed or made known to the individual during the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual, and which are related to its current or planned business or research and development or made during normal working hours, on our premises or using our equipment or proprietary information, are our exclusive property. In many cases our confidentiality and other agreements with consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors require them to assign or grant us licenses to inventions they invent as a result of the work or services they render under such agreements or grant us an option to negotiate a license to use such inventions.

Government Regulation
 
In the United States, drug and biologic products are licensed by FDA for marketing under the Public Health Service Act (the "PHS Act") and regulated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the "FDCA"). Both the FDCA and the PHS Act and their corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacturing, safety, purity, potency, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, marketing, sales, import, export, reporting, advertising and other promotional practices involving drug and biological products. FDA clearance must be obtained before clinical testing of drug and biologic products. FDA licensure also must be obtained before marketing of drug and biological products. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
U.S. Development Process

The process required by the FDA before a drug or biologic product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of nonclinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to GLPs, and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations; 
 •preparation of clinical trial material in accordance with GMPs;
 •submission to the FDA of an application for an IND application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 
 •approval by an institutional review board ("IRB") reviewing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated; 
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to Good Clinical Practices ("GCPs") and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety, purity, potency, and efficacy, of the proposed drug or biological product for its intended use; 
 •submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application ("NDA") or Biologics License Application ("BLA") for marketing approval that includes substantive evidence of safety, purity, potency, and efficacy from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials; 
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection prior to NDA or BLA approval of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug or biological product is produced to assess compliance with GMPs, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s identity, strength, quality and purity; 
 •potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical study sites that generated the data in support of the NDA or BLA;
 •potential FDA Advisory Committee meeting to elicit expert input on critical issues and including a vote by external committee members; 
 •FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the NDA or BLA, and payment of associated user fees, when applicable; and 
 •compliance with any post approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies ("REMS") the potential requirement to conduct post approval studies.
      
Before testing any drug or biological product candidate in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, pharmacology, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the nonclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs.

The clinical study sponsor must submit the results of the nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some nonclinical testing typically continues after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA requests certain changes to a protocol before the trial can begin, or the FDA places the clinical trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a drug or biological product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA.

Clinical trials involving some products for certain diseases, including some rare diseases may begin with testing in patients with the disease. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA’s regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects or their legal representatives provide informed consent. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent IRB, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of study participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Additionally, some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee.

Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
•Phase 1. The drug or biological product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety. In the case of some products for rare diseases, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. 
 •Phase 2. The drug or biological product is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule. 
 •Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. In drugs and biologics for rare diseases where patient populations are small and there is an urgent need for treatment, Phase 3 trials might not be required if an adequate risk/benefit can be demonstrated from the Phase 2 trial. 
 
   Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up.

During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.

Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the drug or biological product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with GMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHS Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final

biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug or biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.

Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the NIH for public dissemination on its clinicaltrials.gov website. Sponsors or distributors of investigational products for the diagnosis, monitoring, or treatment of one or more serious diseases or conditions must also have a publicly available policy on evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access requests.

U.S. Review and Approval Processes

After the completion of clinical trials of a drug or biological product, FDA approval of an NDA or BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the product. The NDA or BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human studies, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the NDA or BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.

Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews an NDA or BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any NDA or BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the NDA or BLA. The FDA reviews the NDA or BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe, potent, and effective for its intended use, has an acceptable purity profile, and is being manufactured in accordance with GMPs to assure and preserve the product’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel products or products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the drug or biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a REMS is necessary to assure the safe use of the drug or biological product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA or BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the NDA or BLA without a REMS, if required.

Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA may inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with GMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND study requirements and GCP requirements. To assure GMP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production, and quality control.

Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than the sponsor interprets the same data. If the agency decides not to approve the NDA or BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA or BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA or BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.

If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a risk management plan, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, designed to further assess a drug or biological product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. As a condition for approval, the FDA may also require additional nonclinical testing as a Phase 4 commitment.

One of the performance goals agreed to by the FDA under the PDUFA is to review standard NDAs or BLAs in ten months from filing and priority NDAs or BLAs in six months from filing, whereupon a review decision is to be made. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs or BLAs and its review goals are subject to change from time to time. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the NDA or BLA sponsor otherwise

provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date.

Post-Approval Requirements

Maintaining substantial compliance with applicable federal, state, and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of drug and biological products continues after approval, particularly with respect to GMP. We will rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of any products that we may commercialize. Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable requirements in the GMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation.

Following approval, the manufacturing facilities are subject to biennial inspections by the FDA, and such inspections may result in an issuance of FDA Form 483 deficiency observations, untitled letter, or a warning letter, which can lead to plant shutdown and other more serious penalties and fines. Prior to the institution of any manufacturing changes, a determination needs to be made whether FDA approval is required in advance. If not done in accordance with FDA expectations, the FDA may restrict supply and may take further action. Annual product reports are required to be submitted annually. Other post-approval requirements applicable to drug and biological products include reporting of GMP deviations that may affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse events, reporting updated safety and efficacy information, and complying with electronic record and signature requirements.

We also must comply with the FDA’s advertising and promotion requirements, such as those related to direct-to-consumer advertising, the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions.

Drug and biological product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drug and biological products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with GMPs and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain GMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved NDA or BLA, including withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.

Orphan Drug Designation

Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant Orphan Drug Designation ("ODD") to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug or biological product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. ODD must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants ODD, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. ODD does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.

If a product that has ODD receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same biological product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as not being able to supply the product for patients or showing clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity.

Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug or biological product as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. If a drug or biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity.


Expedited Review and Approval Programs

The FDA has various programs, including fast track designation, priority review, accelerated approval, and breakthrough therapy designation, that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drug and biological products that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drug and biological products to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures. To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a drug or biological product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need. The FDA will determine that a product will fill an unmet medical need if it will provide a therapy where none exists or provide a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. In addition to other benefits, such as the ability to have greater interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track NDA or BLA before the application is complete, a process known as rolling review.

The FDA may give a priority review designation, such as a rare pediatric disease designation, to drug or biological products that treat a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current PDUFA guidelines. Most products that are eligible for fast track designation may also be considered appropriate to receive a priority review. In addition, drug and biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug or biological product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require a sponsor of a drug or biological product receiving accelerated approval to perform post-marketing studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical endpoint, and the drug or biological product may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures.

Moreover, under the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act enacted in 2012, a sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy.” A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug or biological product that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug or biological product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drug and biological products designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy.

Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decides that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. Furthermore, fast-track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation, do not change the standards for approval and may not ultimately expedite the development or approval process.

Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act

The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 ("BPCIA"), which was enacted as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 ("PPACA"), created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are demonstrated to be “biosimilar” or “interchangeable” with an FDA-licensed reference biological product via an approved BLA. Biosimilarity to an approved reference product requires that there be no differences in conditions of use, route of administration, dosage form, and strength, and no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency. Biosimilarity is demonstrated in steps beginning with rigorous analytical studies or “fingerprinting”, in vitro studies, in vivo animal studies, and generally at least one clinical study, absent a waiver from the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The biosimilarity exercise tests the hypothesis that the investigational product and the reference product are the same. If at any point in the stepwise biosimilarity process a significant difference is observed, then the products are not biosimilar, and the development of a stand-alone NDA or BLA is necessary. In order to meet the higher hurdle of interchangeability, a sponsor must demonstrate that the biosimilar product can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product, and for a product that is administered more than once, that the risk of switching between the reference product and biosimilar product is not greater than the risk of maintaining the patient on the reference product. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the process by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation that are still being evaluated by the FDA. Under the BPCIA, a reference biologic is granted 12 years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product.
Regulation Outside of the United States

In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing clinical studies, commercial sales, and distribution of our products. Most countries outside of the United States require that clinical trial applications be submitted to and approved by the local regulatory authority for each clinical study. In addition, whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of countries outside the U.S. before it can commence clinical studies or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process and requirements vary from country to country, so the number and type of nonclinical, clinical, and manufacturing studies needed may differ, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.

To obtain regulatory approval of an orphan drug under the EU regulatory system, we are mandated to submit a Marketing Authorization Application ("MAA") to be assessed in the Centralized Procedure. The centralized procedure, which came into operation in 1995, allows applicants to obtain a marketing authorization that is valid throughout the EU. It is compulsory for medicinal products manufactured using biotechnological processes, for orphan medicinal products and for human products containing a new active substance which was not authorized in the Community before 20 May 2004 (date of entry into force of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004) and which are intended for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorder or diabetes. The centralized procedure is optional for any other products containing new active substances not authorized in the Community before 20 May 2004 or for products which constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or for which a Community authorization is in the interests of patients at Community level. When a company wishes to place on the market a medicinal product that is eligible for the centralized procedure, it sends an application directly to the European Medicines Agency ("EMA"), to be assessed by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use ("CHMP"). The CHMP is responsible for conducting the assessment of whether a medicine meets the required quality, safety and efficacy requirements, and whether the product has a positive risk/benefit/risk profile. The procedure results in a Commission decision, which is valid in all EU Member States. Centrally-authorized products may be marketed in all Member States.

Centralized Procedure: Full copies of the MAA are sent to a rapporteur and a co-rapporteur designated by the competent EMA scientific committee. They coordinate the EMA’s scientific assessment of the medicinal product and prepare draft reports. Once the draft reports are prepared (other experts might be called upon for this purpose), they are sent to the CHMP, whose comments or objections are communicated to the applicant. The rapporteur is therefore the privileged interlocutor of the applicant and continues to play this role, even after the MA has been granted.

The rapporteur and co-rapporteur then assess the applicant’s replies, submit them for discussion to the CHMP and, taking into account the conclusions of this debate, prepare a final assessment report. Once the evaluation is completed, the CHMP gives a favorable or unfavorable opinion as to whether to grant the authorization. When the opinion is favorable, it shall include the draft summary of the product’s characteristics, the package leaflet and the texts proposed for the various packaging materials. The time limit for the evaluation procedure is 210 days. The EMA then has fifteen days to forward its opinion to the Commission. This is the start of the second phase of the procedure: the decision-making process. The Agency sends to the Commission its opinion and assessment report, together with annexes containing: the SmPC ("Annex 1"); the particulars of the MAH responsible for batch release, the particulars of the manufacturer of the active substance and the conditions of the marketing authorization ("Annex 2"); and the labelling and the package leaflet ("Annex 3"). The annexes are translated into the 22 other official languages of the EU. During the decision-making process, the Commission services verify that the marketing authorization complies with Union law. The Commission has fifteen days to prepare a draft decision. The medicinal product is assigned a Community registration number, which will be placed on its packaging if the marketing authorization is granted. During this period, various Commission directorates-general are consulted on the draft marketing authorization decision.

The draft decision is then sent to the Standing Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use (Member States have one representative each in both of these committees) for their opinions. The Centralized Procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU member states.

Applications from persons or companies seeking “orphan medicinal product designation” for products they intend to develop for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of life-threatening or very serious conditions that affect not more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU are reviewed by the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products ("COMP"). In addition, orphan drug designation can be granted if the drug is intended for a life threatening, seriously debilitating, or serious and chronic condition in the EU and that without incentives it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the EU would be sufficient to justify developing the drug. Orphan drug designation is only available if there is no other satisfactory method approved in the EU of diagnosing, preventing, or treating the condition, or if such a method exists, the proposed orphan drug will be of significant benefit to patients.


Orphan drug designation provides opportunities for fee reductions, protocol assistance and access to the centralized procedure before and during the first year after marketing approval. Fee reductions are not limited to the first year after marketing approval for small and medium enterprises. In addition, if a product which has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives EMA marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan market exclusivity, which means the EMA may not approve any other application to market a similar drug for the same indication for a period of ten years. The exclusivity period may be reduced to six years if the designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Competitors may receive marketing approval of different drugs or biologics for the indications for which the orphan product has exclusivity. In order to do so, however, they must demonstrate that the new drugs or biologics are clinically superior over the existing orphan product. This demonstration of clinical superiority may be done at the time of initial approval or in post-approval studies, depending on the type of marketing authorization granted.

In March 2016, the EMA launched an initiative, The Priority Medicines ("PRIME") scheme, to facilitate development of product candidates in indications, often rare, for which few or no therapies currently exist. The PRIME scheme is intended to encourage drug development in areas of unmet medical need and provides accelerated assessment of products representing substantial innovation reviewed under the centralized procedure. Many benefits accrue to sponsors of product candidates with PRIME designation, including but not limited to, early and proactive regulatory dialogue with the EMA, frequent discussions on clinical trial designs and other development program elements, and accelerated MAA assessment once a dossier has been submitted. Importantly, a dedicated contact and rapporteur from the CHMP is appointed early in the PRIME scheme facilitating increased understanding of the product at EMA’s committee level. An initial meeting initiates these relationships and includes a team of multidisciplinary experts at the EMA to provide guidance on the overall development and regulatory strategies.

The U.K. left the EU on January 31, 2020 following which, existing EU medicinal product legislation continued to apply in the U.K. during the transition period under the terms of the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement. A transition period, which ended on December 31, 2020, maintained access to the EU single market and to the global trade deals negotiated by the EU on behalf of its members. The transition period provided time for the U.K. and EU to negotiate a framework for partnership for the future, which was then crystallized in the Trade and Cooperation Agreement ("TCA") and became effective on January 1, 2021.

From January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency ("MHRA") will be the U.K.’s standalone medicines and medical devices regulator. As a result of the Northern Ireland protocol, different rules will apply in Northern Ireland than in England, Wales and Scotland (together "Great Britain", or "GB"); broadly, Northern Ireland will continue to follow the EU regulatory regime, but its national competent authority will remain the MHRA. The MHRA has published a draft guidance on how various aspects of the U.K. regulatory regime for medicines will operate in GB and in Northern Ireland following the expiry of the Brexit transition period on December 31, 2020. The guidance includes clinical trials, marketing authorizations, importing, exporting and pharmacovigilance and is relevant to any business involved in the research, development or commercialization of medicines in the U.K. The new guidance will be given effect via the Human Medicines Regulations (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (the "Exit Regulations"). The U.K. regulatory regime largely mirrors that of the EU.

The MHRA has introduced changes to national licensing procedures, including procedures to prioritize access to new medicines that will benefit patients, an accelerated assessment procedure and new routes of evaluation for novel products and biotechnological products. All existing E.U. MAs for centrally authorized products were automatically be converted (grandfathered) into U.K. MAs free-of-charge on January 1, 2021.

There will be no pre-marketing authorization orphan designation. Instead, the MHRA will review applications for orphan designation in parallel to the corresponding MA application. The criteria are essentially the same, but have been tailored for the GB market, i.e. the prevalence of the condition in GB (rather than the EU) must not be more than 5 in 10,000. Should an orphan designation be granted, the period for market exclusivity will be set from the date of first approval of the product in GB or EU/European Economic Area, wherever is earliest.



Healthcare Laws and Regulations

Sales of our product candidate, if approved, or any other future product candidate will be subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we might conduct our business. The healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include the following:
•The federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person or entity to knowingly and willfully, directly or indirectly, solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration that is in exchange for or to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order, lease of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value; 
 •Federal false claims and false statement laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to, or approval by, federal programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent; 
 •HIPAA created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors or making any false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services; 
 •HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 and their implementing regulations, impose obligations on certain types of individuals and entities regarding the electronic exchange of information in common healthcare transactions, as well as standards relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information; 
 •
•The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to CMS information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals (as well as certain other healthcare professionals beginning in 2022), or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and requires applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations to report annually to the government ownership and investment interests held by the physicians described above and their immediate family members; and 
 •The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA") generally prohibits offering, promising, giving, or authorizing others to give anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to a non-U.S. government official in order to influence official action, or otherwise obtain or retain business. The FCPA also requires public companies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the corporation and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. Our industry is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with public officials, including officials of non-U.S. governments. Additionally, in many other countries, the health care providers who prescribe pharmaceuticals are employed by their government, and the purchasers of pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, our dealings with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the FCPA. Recently, the SEC and Department of Justice have increased their FCPA enforcement activities with respect to pharmaceutical companies. Violations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, the closing down of our facilities, requirements to obtain export licenses, cessation of business activities in sanctioned countries, implementation of compliance programs, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Enforcement actions may be brought by the Department of Justice or the Securities and Exchanges Commission (“SEC”), and recent enacted legislation has expanded the SEC’s power to seek disgorgement in all FCPA cases filed in federal court and extended the statute of limitations in SEC enforcement actions in intent-based claims such as those under the FCPA from five years to ten years.
 
Many states have similar laws and regulations, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. Additionally, we may be subject to state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the federal government’s and/or pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines, state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures, as well as state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA. Additionally, to the extent that our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws.


Healthcare Reform

The United States and many foreign jurisdictions have enacted or proposed legislative and regulatory changes affecting the healthcare system. The United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments also have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. In recent years, Congress has considered reductions in Medicare reimbursement levels for drugs administered by physicians. CMS, the agency that administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs, also has authority to revise reimbursement rates and to implement coverage restrictions for some drugs. Cost reduction initiatives and changes in coverage implemented through legislation or regulation could decrease utilization of and reimbursement for any approved products. While Medicare regulations apply only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Therefore, any reduction in reimbursement that results from federal legislation or regulation may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or collectively the Affordable Care Act (the “ACA”), substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. The Affordable Care Act is intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against healthcare fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers, and impose additional health policy reforms.
 
There have been significant ongoing efforts to modify or eliminate the Affordable Care Act. On January 20, 2017, former President Trump signed an executive order directing federal agencies to exercise existing authorities to reduce burdens associated with the ACA pending further action by Congress. In October 2017, he signed an Executive Order which directed federal agencies to modify how the ACA is implemented. The Tax Act, enacted on December 22, 2017, repealed the shared responsibility payment for individuals who fail to maintain minimum essential coverage under Section 5000A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("IRC"), commonly referred to as the individual mandate.

Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since passage of the ACA. The Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of an amount greater than $1.2 trillion for the fiscal years 2012 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reductions to several government programs. These reductions included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to healthcare providers of up to 2.0% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013. Subsequent litigation extended the 2% reduction, on average, to 2030 unless additional  Congressional action is taken. However, pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the "CARES Act"), the 2% Medicare sequester reductions have been suspended from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 
Further legislative and regulatory changes under the ACA remain possible, although the Biden Administration has signaled that it plans to build on the ACA and expand the number of people who are eligible for subsidies under it. President Biden indicated that he intends to use executive orders to undo changes to the ACA made by the former administration and would advocate for legislation to build on the ACA. It is unknown what form any such changes or any law would take, and how or whether it may affect our business in the future. We expect that changes or additions to the ACA, the Medicare and Medicaid programs, changes allowing the federal government to directly negotiate drug prices and changes stemming from other healthcare reform measures, especially with regard to healthcare access, financing or other legislation in individual states, could have a material adverse effect on the healthcare industry.

The ACA has been subject to challenges in the courts. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court judge ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. On December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that the individual mandate is unconstitutional and remanded the case to the Texas District Court to reconsider its earlier invalidation of the entire ACA. An appeal was taken to the Supreme Court, which heard oral arguments in the case on November 10, 2020. On June 17, 2021, the Supreme Court upheld the ACA and dismissed the case.
 
At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.

We expect that additional federal, state and foreign healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in limited coverage and reimbursement and reduced demand for our products, once approved, or additional pricing pressures.


Employees and Human Capital Resources
 
Our mission is to deliver innovative precision therapies to improve the lives of patients and families battling genetically-driven cardiovascular and mechanistically-related diseases. Accordingly, we are building a team who is passionate about our mission and establishing a culture where patients are at the center of all we do, with core values that connect us to each other and our stakeholders, and define who we are, what we stand for, and how we work.
 
As of March 15, 2022, we had 19 full-time employees, including our Chief Executive Officer, Magdalene Cook, M.D., our Chief Medical Officer, Marc Semigran, M.D., our Chief Scientific Officer, Matt Killeen, Ph.D., and 16 other individuals, 12 of whom are engaged in research and development. Of our 19 full-time employees, 11 have Ph.D. or M.D. degrees and 14 are engaged in research and development activities. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements, and we consider our relationship with employees to be good. We also utilize the services of several independent consultants to support our R&D and G&A operations, including our Interim CFO, Wendy DiCicco.

We are focused on effective identification, recruitment, development, and retention of, and compensation and benefits to, human resource talent, including workforce and management development, diversity and inclusion initiatives, succession planning, and corporate culture and leadership quality, which are vital to our success. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards and cash-based performance bonus awards.

We anticipate hiring additional employees that could result in a total of up to approximately 50 full-time employees by the end of 2022, across R&D and G&A operations.
