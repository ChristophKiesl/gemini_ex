Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

General
 
We are a blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company on January 7, 2021. We were incorporated for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to throughout this prospectus as our initial business combination. We have not selected any business combination target.
 
We seek to capitalize on the nearly 100 years of combined investing and operating experience of our management team. We believe our management team is uniquely qualified to identify, acquire and operate businesses that can benefit from our industry, operating and investment experience, and the established relationships of our management team, Industry Advisors and board of directors to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders. While we may pursue an initial business combination target in any business, industry or geographical location, we intend to focus our search broadly within the consumer and distribution related and adjacent industries. Investment opportunities are sourced through our proprietary and differentiated network and deep relationships with executives, advisors, and intermediaries built over decades of investing in and operating consumer and distribution businesses.
 
Our company was founded by the senior executives of Twin Ridge Capital Management, LLC (“TRCM”) and is led by our Chairman, Dale F. Morrison, our Co-Chief Executive Officer and President, Sanjay K. Morey and our Co-Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, William P. Russell, Jr. We believe that we derive significant benefit from our affiliation with TRCM. Founded in 2011, TRCM is a private investment firm that makes investments in consumer and distribution companies, with a particular focus on investing in food, food distribution, and other food-related companies. The firm’s investment thesis is to identify strong companies led by excellent management teams with the desire to take on an active partner who can help drive transformational operational change in their business. For each investment opportunity, TRCM develops detailed investment theses and operational improvement plans which have the potential to create highly attractive returns. Over the course of their careers, the partners of TRCM have overseen approximately $2.9 billion in equity capital across 30 investments.

Business Strategy
 
Our acquisition and value creation strategy is to identify, acquire and build a company in the consumer or distribution sector that complements the experience of our management team, Industry Advisors and directors and that can benefit from their collective operational experience of over 200 years.
 
We are evaluating a broad range of targets across all segments of the consumer and distribution industries including, without limiting our scope, businesses that focus on the food, food distribution, and other food-related industries. We believe these are attractive industries with compelling market dynamics. We believe there are a large number of companies operating within these sizeable and growing sectors which possess various attractive qualities that are key to successful public companies such as resilient financial profiles through economic cycles, predictable revenues and high cash flow generation, scale opportunities, brand equity and innovation, and both organic and inorganic growth opportunities
 
Our management team, Industry Advisors and directors bring together a number of competitive strengths that contribute in our ability to successfully execute a transaction within these industries, including;
 

• | a track record of successfully identifying and acquiring companies and deploying a value creation toolkit to deliver shareholder value over an extended time period;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | substantial depth of industry experience which enables us to understand market trends, quickly evaluate business models and gauge their fit with our investment criteria;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | significant experience leading many of North America’s largest consumer and distribution companies, and developing and executing shareholder value creation programs including recruiting world-class management, identifying growth opportunities, delivering operating efficiencies and successfully integrating strategic acquisitions; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a deep network of senior-level industry executives who can be recruited to enhance target company management teams to help accelerate implementation of our value creation initiatives;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a vast and highly leverageable deal sourcing network providing significant reach and access to a comprehensive opportunity set imperative to the sourcing process for our initial business combination;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a history of accessing the public capital markets across various business cycles, including assisting companies with the transition to public ownership and providing leadership within public companies; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a deep expertise in proprietary and brokered deal sourcing, financial and operational due diligence, transaction negotiation and execution, equity and debt financing, and managing multiple acquisitions.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Members of our management team, Industry Advisors and directors are utilizing their networks of relationships to articulate the parameters of our search for a target company and a potential business combination and begin the process of pursuing and reviewing potentially interesting leads. In addition, we anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, which may include investment market participants, private equity groups, investment banking firms, consultants, accounting firms and large business enterprises.
 


 
Acquisition Criteria
 
In line with our business strategy, our management team has identified certain criteria and non-exhaustive guidelines that helps inform our evaluation of prospective targets. Although we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet the criteria described below, it is our intention to acquire companies with the following characteristics:

• | fundamentally sound but underperforming their potential and exhibit unrecognized value creation opportunities;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | can benefit from our team’s ability to harness its extensive industry sector experience and professional networks to develop and implement our collection of value-creation operational strategies;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | strong competitive market positioning driven by brand equity, advantages of scope or scale, differentiated products or services, proprietary technology, robust infrastructure or strong customer or supplier relationships;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | attractive financial profile with multiple avenues for continued future growth and margin upside that result in sustainable free cash flow generation;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | experienced and public-ready management team with internal reporting and control systems that can comply with the requirements of a public listing; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential to offer an attractive risk-adjusted return for our stockholders across business cycles.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Given the strength of our relationships, network, reputation, expertise, and proprietary deal flow, our management team is provided with a robust flow of acquisition opportunities. We believe we are well-positioned to identify potential target businesses with appropriate valuations which can benefit from new capital for growth and a public listing.
 
Our Business Combination Process
 
As the deal sourcing process yields targets we believe are strong candidates for a business combination, we began conducting a comprehensive due diligence review process which includes, among other things, analyzing both historical and projected financial data, meetings with key stakeholders and senior management, on-site visits of facilities, interviews with suppliers and customers, legal diligence, and other reviews and analyses which may be necessary.
 
Additionally, we are leveraging our value creation framework, including operational and capital allocation experience in order to:
 

• | Acquire the target company at an attractive price relative to our view of its intrinsic value:
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Upon completion of a thorough due diligence process, we conduct comprehensive and detailed analyses of each business, both operational and financial, to arrive at a fair view of the intrinsic value of any potential business combination. We may leverage various operational, financial, and industry experts to further develop our analyses. Certain metrics we may use include relative valuation benchmarks for each industry, relevant precedent transactions within each sector, profitability and future cash flow potential, and other valuation methods we deem appropriate in order to effect a business combination at an attractive price relative to the intrinsic value of the target company.
 


 

• | Enhance operational performance through driving organic growth, increasing profitability and strengthening market position:
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Conducting rigorous research and analysis from the bottom-up is core to our strategy. Our management team, Industry Advisors and directors have significant experience in systematically creating substantial equity value as owners and operators of consumer and distribution companies. Our framework is structured around strengthening corporate leadership and implementing data driven competitive strategies and best practices to achieve operational improvements and organizational efficiencies which lead to profitable organic growth, increased market share, and improved margin profile and cash flow generation.
 

• | Optimize capital structure to establish a strong financial profile in support of future growth:
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe our expertise in structuring M&A transactions and operating businesses enable the team to execute a business combination with an effective capital structure that supports future long-term growth, providing the flexibility for investments in organic and inorganic growth opportunities while maintaining a strong financial profile.
 

• | Seek follow-on strategic acquisitions and divestitures to further grow stockholder value:
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The management team are continuously examining and reviewing the strategic direction of the company and may determine follow-on acquisitions or divestitures of non-core assets are strategically and/or financially appropriate. For example, the team may seek consolidation opportunities in the company’s primary and/or adjacent sectors in addition to vertical or horizontal integration opportunities.
 
Following the completion of our initial business combination, we will seek to drive additional stockholder value by leveraging the collective experience of our management team, Industry Advisors and directors to develop and implement various operational, financial, and other corporate strategies. We seek to improve long-term profitability, cash flow generation, and liquidity. As the business evolves, we may access capital markets, consider strategic acquisitions or divestitures, evaluate corporate governance, or any other initiatives we identify to improve stockholder value.
 
Potential Conflicts of Interest
 
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers, Industry Advisors or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers, Industry Advisors or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion that our initial business combination is fair to the Company from a financial point of view from either an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions that such initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context.
 
Members of our management team, our Industry Advisors or members of our board of directors may directly or indirectly own our founder shares, ordinary shares and/or private placement warrants following our initial public offering, and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors were to be included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination.
 
Each of our officers, Industry Advisors and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to another entity pursuant to which such officer, director or Industry Advisor is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity. Accordingly, if any of our officers, Industry Advisors or directors become aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such other entity, subject to their fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law. For a list of our executive officers and entities for which a conflict of interest may or does exist between such officers and the company, please refer to “Management—Conflicts of Interest.”
 


 
In addition, our sponsor and our officers, Industry Advisors and directors may sponsor or form other special purpose acquisition companies similar to ours or may pursue other business or investment ventures during the period in which we are seeking an initial business combination. Any such companies, businesses or investments may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an initial business combination. However, we do not believe that any such potential conflicts would materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination.
 
Initial Business Combination
 
So long as our securities are then listed on the NYSE, our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the net assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at the time of signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or an independent valuation or appraisal firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of a target business or businesses, it may be unable to do so if the board is less familiar or experienced with the target company’s business, there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of the company’s assets or prospects, including if such company is at an early stage of development, operations or growth, or if the anticipated transaction involves a complex financial analysis or other specialized skills and the board determines that outside expertise would be helpful or necessary in conducting such analysis. Since any opinion, if obtained, would merely state that the fair market value of the target business meets the 80% of net assets threshold, unless such opinion includes material information regarding the valuation of a target business or the consideration to be provided, it is not anticipated that copies of such opinion would be distributed to our shareholders. However, if required under applicable law, any proxy statement that we deliver to shareholders and file with the SEC in connection with a proposed transaction will include such opinion.
 
We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-business combination company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-business combination company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity interests of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-business combination company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses. In addition, we have agreed not to enter into a definitive agreement regarding an initial business combination without the prior consent of our sponsor. If our securities are not then listed on the NYSE for whatever reason, we would no longer be required to meet the foregoing 80% of net asset test.
 
To the extent we effect our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.
 


 
The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination.
 
Other Considerations
 
Past performance of our management team or our Industry Advisors is not a guarantee of either (i) success with respect to a business combination that may be consummated or (ii) the ability to successfully identify and execute a transaction. You should not rely on the historical record of management and its affiliates or our advisors as indicative of future performance.

We are a Cayman Islands exempted company. Exempted companies are Cayman Islands companies conducting business mainly outside the Cayman Islands and, as such, are exempted from complying with certain provisions of the Companies Act. As an exempted company, we have applied for and received a tax exemption undertaking from the Cayman Islands government that, in accordance with Section 6 of the Tax Concessions Act (2018 Revision) of the Cayman Islands, for a period of 20 years from the date of the undertaking, no law which is enacted in the Cayman Islands imposing any tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations will apply to us or our operations and, in addition, that no tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations or which is in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax will be payable (i) on or in respect of our shares, debentures or other obligations or (ii) by way of the withholding in whole or in part of a payment of dividend or other distribution of income or capital by us to our shareholders or a payment of principal or interest or other sums due under a debenture or other obligation of us.
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies,” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
 


 
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A ordinary shares that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in nonconvertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.
 
References herein to “emerging growth company” have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
 
Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the prior June 30 or (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30.
