ITEM 1.            BUSINESS

Sinclair Broadcast Group, Inc. ("SBG," the "Company," or sometimes referred to as "we" or "our") is a diversified media company with national reach and a strong focus on providing high-quality content on our local television stations, digital platform, and, prior to the Deconsolidation (as defined below under Local Sports in this Item 1), regional and national sports networks. The content, distributed through our broadcast platform and third-party platforms, consists of programming provided by third-party networks and syndicators, local news, other original programming produced by us and our owned networks, and, prior to the Deconsolidation, college and professional sports. Additionally, we own digital media products that are complementary to our extensive portfolio of television station related digital properties and we have interests in, own, manage and/or operate technical and software services companies, research and development for the advancement of broadcast technology, and other media and non-media related businesses and assets, including real estate, venture capital, private equity, and direct investments.
We are a Maryland corporation founded in 1986. Our principal executive offices are located at 10706 Beaver Dam Road, Hunt Valley, Maryland 21030. Our telephone number is (410) 568-1500 and our website address is www.sbgi.net. The information contained on, or accessible through, our website is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is not incorporated herein by reference.
Segments 
As of December 31, 2022, we had one reportable segment for accounting purposes, broadcast. Prior to the Deconsolidation, we had two reportable segments for accounting purposes, broadcast and local sports. Our broadcast segment is comprised of our television stations, which are owned and/or operated by our wholly-owned subsidiary, Sinclair Television Group, Inc. ("STG") and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. Our local sports segment was comprised of our regional sports networks, which are owned and operated by our subsidiary, Diamond Sports Group, LLC ("DSG") and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. We also earn revenues from our owned networks, original content, digital and internet services, technical services, and non-media investments. These businesses are included within "other". Other is not a reportable segment but is included for reconciliation purposes. See Deconsolidation of Diamond Sports Intermediate Holdings LLC under Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies within the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Broadcast 
As of December 31, 2022, our broadcast segment primarily consisted of our broadcast television stations. We own, provide programming and operating services pursuant to local marketing agreements ("LMA"), or provide sales services and other non-programming operating services pursuant to other outsourcing agreements (such as joint sales agreements ("JSA") and shared services agreements ("SSA")) to 185 stations in 86 markets. These stations broadcast 636 channels, including 236 channels affiliated with primary networks or program service providers comprised of:  FOX (55), ABC (40), CBS (30), NBC (25), CW (46), and MyNetworkTV ("MNT") (40).  The other 400 channels broadcast programming from programming services including Antenna TV, Bounce, CHARGE!, Comet, Dabl, Decades, Estrella TV, GetTV, MeTV, Quest, Rewind, Stadium, TBD, TCN, Telemundo, This TV, UniMas, Univision, Weather, and two channels broadcasting independent programming. Solely for the purpose of this report, these 185 stations and 636 channels are referred to as “our” stations and channels, and the use of such term shall not be construed as an admission that we control such stations or channels. Refer to our Television Markets and Stations table later in this Item 1. for more information.
Our broadcast segment provides free over-the-air programming to television viewing audiences in the communities we serve through our local television stations. The programming that we provide on our primary channels consists of network provided programs, locally-produced news, local sporting events, programming from program service arrangements, syndicated entertainment programs, and internally originated programming. We provide live, local sporting events on many of our stations by acquiring the local television broadcast rights for these events or through our relationship with national networks.  
We are one of the nation's largest producers of local news. We produce more than 2,500 hours of news per week at 126 stations in 80 markets. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our stations were awarded with 290 journalism awards, including 24 regional and two National RTDNA Edward R. Murrow awards, and 74 regional Emmy awards.
Our broadcast segment derives revenue primarily from the sale of advertising inventory on our television stations and fees received from Distributors, which includes distributors that distribute multiple television channels through the internet without supplying their own data transport infrastructure; as well as other over-the-top ("OTT") distributors that deliver live and on-demand programming, for the right to distribute our channels on their distribution platforms. We also earn revenues by selling digital advertisements on third-party platforms, providing digital content to non-linear devices via websites, mobile, and social media advertisements, and providing digital marketing services. Our objective is to meet the needs of our advertising customers by delivering significant audiences in key demographics. Our strategy is to achieve this objective by providing quality local news programming, popular network, syndicated and live sports programs, and other original content to our viewing audience. We attract most of our national television advertisers through national marketing representation firms. Our local television advertisers are primarily attracted through the use of a local sales force at each of our television stations, which is comprised of approximately 520 marketing consultants and 70 local sales managers company-wide.
Our operating results are subject to cyclical fluctuations from political advertising. Political spending has been significantly higher in the even-number years due to the cyclicality of political elections. In addition, every four years, political spending is typically elevated further due to the advertising related to the presidential election. Because of the political election cyclicality, there has been a significant difference in our operating results when comparing even-numbered years’ performance to the odd numbered years’ performance. Additionally, our operating results are impacted by the number and importance of individual political races and issues discussed on a national level as well as those within the local communities we serve. We believe political advertising will continue to be an important advertising category in our industry. Political advertising levels may increase further as political-activism, around social, political, economic, and environmental causes continues to draw attention and Political Action Committees ("PACs"), including so-called Super PACs, continue to increase spending. 
Television Markets and Stations. As of December 31, 2022, our broadcast segment owns and operates or provides programming and/or sales and other shared services to television stations in the following 86 markets:

Deconsolidation of Diamond Sports Intermediate Holdings LLC. On March 1, 2022, SBG's subsidiary Diamond Sports Intermediate Holdings, LLC, and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively "DSIH") completed a series of transactions (the "Transaction"). As part of the Transaction, the governance structure of DSIH was modified including changes to the composition of its Board of Managers, resulting in the Company's loss of voting control. As a result, DSIH, whose operations represented the entirety of our local sports segment, was deconsolidated from our consolidated financial statements effective as of March 1, 2022 (the "Deconsolidation"). The consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 therefore includes two months of activity related to DSIH prior to the Deconsolidation. Subsequent to February 28, 2022, the assets and liabilities of DSIH are no longer included within our consolidated balance sheets. Any discussions related to results, operations, and accounting policies associated with DSIH are referring to the periods prior to the Deconsolidation. See Deconsolidation of Diamond Sports Intermediate Holdings LLC under Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies within the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Prior to the Deconsolidation, the local sports segment consisted primarily of our Bally Sports network brands ("Bally RSNs"), the Marquee Sports Network ("Marquee") joint venture, and a minority equity interest in the Yankee Entertainment and Sports Network, LLC ("YES Network") through February 28, 2022. On March 1, 2022, the Bally RSNs, Marquee, and YES Network were deconsolidated from our financial statements. Through February 28, 2022, we refer to the Bally RSNs and Marquee as "the RSNs." The RSNs and YES Network own the exclusive rights to air, among other sporting events, the games of professional sports teams in designated local viewing areas.
Other
Owned Networks and Content
We own and operate Tennis Channel, a cable network which includes coverage of many of tennis' top tournaments and original professional sport and tennis lifestyle shows; the Tennis Channel International streaming service; Tennis Channel Plus streaming service; T2 FAST, a 24-hours a day free ad-supported streaming television channel; and Tennis.com, the most visited online tennis platform in the world (collectively, "Tennis").
We also own and operate various networks carried on distribution platforms owned by us or others, including: Comet, our science fiction network; CHARGE!, our adventure and action-based network; and TBD, the first multiscreen TV network in the U.S. market to bring premium internet-first content to TV homes across America. We also have a majority ownership interest in Stadium, a network that brings together professional sports highlights and college games. 
Our internally developed content, in addition to our local news, includes our original news program, The National Desk ("The National Desk"), with a morning edition hosted by Jan Jeffcoat, an evening edition hosted by Meagan O'Halloran, and a weekend edition hosted by Eugene Ramirez, and Full Measure with Sharyl Attkisson ("Full Measure"), our national Sunday morning investigative and political analysis program. In 2022, we announced a broad, multi-platform creative partnership with Anthony E. Zuiker, creator of the CSI: Crime Scene Investigation franchise, to create content across a range of formats and subjects. Working with our news teams, Mr. Zuiker will highlight the compelling stories that deserve to be told in a longer, more dynamic format, broadening the appeal for a global audience. Mr. Zuiker will also develop content that can live adjacent to news programming and across ancillary verticals. Potential programming categories include docuseries, game shows, and topical talk.
Digital and Internet
We earn revenues from Compulse, a marketing technology and managed services company, by licensing the platform to other local media companies and agencies, as well as executing their digital media initiatives across search, social, programmatic, email, and more. 
 NewsON is a free, ad-supported app that provides instant access to live or on-demand local news broadcasts, including non-Sinclair affiliate partners. Sinclair Digital Ventures focuses on investment in emerging digital technologies, ad tech, and digital content companies that support, complement, or expand the Company's businesses. 
 In November 2020, we entered into agreements for a long-term, enterprise-wide strategic partnership with Bally's Corporation ("Bally's") to combine Bally's vertically integrated, proprietary sports betting technology and expansive market access footprint with our premier portfolio of local broadcast stations, Tennis, digital and over-the-air television network Stadium and the RSN's. This partnership is expected to enhance the gamification of live sports to provide audiences interactive viewing experiences and drive legalized sports betting monetization. In connection with the agreement, we also received various equity interests in Bally's and branding integrations, including naming rights for the regional sports networks under the Bally's brand. See Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 6. Other Assets within the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
Technical Services
We own subsidiaries which are dedicated to providing technical services to the broadcast industry, including: Dielectric, a designer and manufacturer of broadcast systems including all components from transmitter output to antenna; and ONE Media 3.0, whose purpose is to develop business opportunities, products, and services associated with the NextGen TV broadcast transmission standard and TV platform. We have also partnered with several other companies in the design and deployment of NextGen TV services including: Saankhya Labs to develop NextGen TV technologies to be used in consumer devices; CAST.ERA, a joint venture with South Korea’s leading mobile operator, SK Telecom, to develop wireless, cloud infrastructure and artificial intelligence technologies; and BitPath, a joint venture with another broadcaster, to deploy and exploit datacasting models using NextGen capabilities.
Non-media Investments
We own various non-media related investments across multiple asset classes including real estate, venture capital, private equity, and direct investments in market-defining companies. Our investments in real estate include commercial real estate, including office and retail space, and residential real estate, including apartment complexes and development projects. Our investments in venture capital and private equity funds include capital for the advertising, marketing, and media technology sectors, sports betting, e-sports, and sports tech, as well as funeral homes, cemeteries, and pet cremation facilities. We hold direct investments in technology driven companies, including wireless communication and semiconductor solutions, next-gen communication solutions, advertising intelligence and data security.
Customers
In 2022, the broadcast and, prior to the Deconsolidation, local sports segments had three customers that individually exceeded 10% of consolidated revenue. Any disruption in our relationship with these customers could have a material adverse effect on the broadcast segment and our results of operations.
Operating Strategy
Programming to Attract Viewership. We seek to target our programming offerings to attract viewership, to meet the needs of the communities in which we serve, and to meet the needs of our advertising customers by entering into network affiliation agreements that provide us the right to broadcast general entertainment network programming, national news, and sports programming. 
Our stations seek to broadcast live, local, and national sporting events that would appeal to a large segment of the local community. Moreover, our stations produce local news at 126 stations in 80 markets. See News below for further discussion. Our stations also seek to develop original programming or obtain, at attractive prices, popular syndicated programming that is complementary to each station’s network programming, purchasing syndicated content, and producing live, local news and sports. 
Television advertising prices are based on ratings information measured and distributed by Nielsen and Comscore. Ratings methodologies have been changing rapidly due to advancements in technology and changes in the manners in which viewers consume news, sports, and entertainment. Certain new methodologies are currently not accredited by the Media Rating Council ("MRC"), an independent organization that monitors rating services, and may not reflect actual viewership levels.
News.  Through local news, our mission is to serve our communities by sharing relevant information to alert, protect, and empower our audiences. We believe that the production and broadcasting of local news is an important link to the community and an aid to a station’s efforts to expand its viewership. In addition, local news programming can provide access to advertising sources targeted specifically to local news viewers. Our news stations also produce content on digital platforms such as websites, mobile applications, OTT distributors, social media, digital newsletters, and podcasts.
Our local news initiatives are an important part of our strategy. We have entered into local news sharing arrangements in which we receive news in eight markets from other in-market broadcasters. We believe that, in the markets where we have news share arrangements, such arrangements generally provide both higher viewer ratings and revenues for the station receiving the news and generate a profit for the news share provider. Generally, both parties and the local community are beneficiaries of these arrangements.
In addition to our traditional local news stories, we have utilized our national reach and physical presence in the nation's capital to provide our local viewers with broader national news stories which are relevant to our local viewers.
Our local news coverage is supported by our national news desk and Capitol Hill bureau. These teams focus on providing context and perspective to important stories in the daily news cycle. This content provides a significant point of difference with a focus on accountability reporting. Available on-air and online, the bureau not only expands our news presence, but gives our local station viewers an opportunity to hear the views of their members of Congress through programs such as "Connect to Congress," our weekly on-air and digital feature which provides an electronic video pathway for lawmakers to speak to their constituents. Our weekly investigative news program, Full Measure with Sharyl Attkisson, reinforces our mission to provide our fearless storytelling on significant topics of public importance.
Our original news program, The National Desk, provides viewers with a comprehensive, commentary-free look at the most impactful national news and regional stories throughout the day. Leveraging our expansive local news footprint, The National Desk elevates some of the most important stories occurring in cities and towns across the country. With reporters residing in the communities they cover, The National Desk has access to real stories from the perspectives of those they affect directly. The goal of The National Desk is to leverage these assets into a single news program for a national audience. The program also supplements expansive local coverage by bringing the most important national headlines to audiences. The National Desk morning news edition is hosted by award-winning anchor Jan Jeffcoat with Cayle Thompson as the Live Desk anchor, giving viewers the news to start their day. The National Desk evening edition is hosted by award-winning journalist Meagan O’Halloran with Eugene Ramirez as the Live Desk Anchor. In March 2022, we added a weekend edition, anchored by Eugene Ramirez, featuring content from The National Desk's morning and evening newscasts as well as The National Desk’s journalists covering Capitol Hill, examining the key issues being debated in the halls of Congress. In May 2022, we added the National Weather Desk to the program, which provides viewers with a comprehensive look at the most impactful weather stories throughout the day. The National Desk weekday and/or weekend editions together air on 84 of our markets and across all of our news websites. TheNationalDesk.com features additional hours of breaking news, with content from The National Desk’s dedicated team of journalists as well as our newsrooms around the US. We have a national investigative team of 15 journalists, plus more than 30 local investigative reporters. We plan to continue to grow our investigative footprint, and to provide in-depth stories not covered elsewhere.
This is our 10th year of producing community "Your Voice Your Future" Town Halls. These Town Halls are produced in the local markets and give our viewers an opportunity to have a voice and ask their elected leaders questions on important local and national topics. In 2022 and 2021 we produced 198 and 162 Town Halls, respectively, throughout the country, covering a variety of topics including crime, police funding, police shortages, affordable housing, mental health, opioids, bullying, finance, and human trafficking. In 2022, we organized 56 political debates featuring gubernatorial, mayoral, senatorial, and congressional races, as well as School Superintendent in Oklahoma City and school board positions in Virginia. Since launching our commitment to give a voice to our viewers, our Town Halls have produced 1,198 productions to educate and address the needs of our audience.
Sports. Live sports have remained highly popular with fans and advertisers. Sports programming generally elicits strong emotional responses and attracts a loyal and passionate following among fans. Our premium live sports programming typically attracts viewership demographics that are highly desirable to advertisers. Every sports season is a new chapter in a story that has continued for decades and is popular across fans from multiple generations. As media has continued to trend toward on-demand consumption, sports events have remained an "appointment viewing" event. As such, live sports content is frequently the most watched programming in a local market on most nights.
Tennis has certain telecast rights to the US Open, Wimbledon, Roland Garros (French Open), Australian Open, ATP World Tour events, WTA competitions, Laver Cup, and Billie Jean King Cup. Our stations also broadcast programming and other content provided by Tennis, and we provide access to certain events through our DTC streaming service, Tennis Channel Plus. Tennis Channel International brings live competition and network content to 8 countries in Europe and Asia, including Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Greece, the U.K., the Netherlands, Monaco, and India, via digital subscription and free ad-supported streaming TV ("FAST"). Additional platforms Tennis.com, the world’s number one tennis website, and T2, Tennis Channel's first FAST offering in the United States, are complementary offerings which allow us to provide greater and more in-depth tennis content to consumers on TV and internet.
Additionally, some of our stations have the local television broadcast rights for certain sporting events, including Major League Baseball ("MLB"), National Basketball Association ("NBA"), National Hockey League ("NHL"), National Football League ("NFL") preseason, and certain other college and high school sports. Our CW and MNT stations generally face fewer preemption restrictions on broadcasting live local sporting events compared with our FOX, ABC, CBS, and NBC stations, which are required to broadcast a greater number of hours of programming supplied by the networks. In addition, our stations that are affiliated with FOX, ABC, CBS, and NBC have network arrangements to broadcast certain MLB, NBA, NHL, NFL, and Professional Golf Association events, as well as other popular sporting events.
Control of Operating and Programming Costs.  By employing a disciplined approach to managing programming acquisition and other costs, our stations have been able to achieve operating margins that we believe are very competitive within the television broadcast industry. We believe our national reach as of December 31, 2022 of approximately 39% of the country provides us with a strong position to negotiate with programming providers and, as a result, the opportunity to purchase high quality programming at more favorable prices. Moreover, we emphasize control of each of our station’s programming and operating costs through program-specific profit analysis, detailed budgeting, regionalization of staff, and detailed long-term planning models. We also control our programming costs by creating original high-quality programming that is distributed on our broadcast platform.
Developing Local Franchises.  We believe the greatest opportunity for a sustainable and growing customer base lies within our local communities. Therefore, we have focused on developing a strong local sales force, which is comprised of approximately 520 marketing consultants and 70 local sales managers company-wide. Excluding political advertising revenue, distribution revenues, and other revenues, 60% and 56% of net time sales were local for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our goal is to grow our local revenues by increasing our market share, developing new business opportunities, and offering marketing solutions across our platforms. 
Attract and Retain High Quality Management.  We believe that much of our success is due to our ability to attract and retain highly-skilled and motivated managers at corporate, stations, and other businesses. We provide a combination of base salary, long-term incentive compensation including equity awards and, where appropriate, cash bonus pay designed to be competitive with comparable employers in our industry, competitive health benefits, and learning and development opportunities. A significant portion of the compensation available to certain members of our senior management and our sales force is based on their achievement of certain performance goals. We also encourage station and network managers and employees to utilize our diverse business to grow in their careers while remaining in the Sinclair family via internal promotion and relocation.
Multi-Channel Broadcasting.  FCC rules allow television broadcasters to transmit additional digital channels within the spectrum allocated to each FCC license holder. This provides our stations' viewers with additional programming alternatives at no additional cost to them. We may consider other alternative programming formats that we could air using our multi-channel digital spectrum space with the goal towards achieving higher profits and community service. As of December 31, 2022, our stations have 451 multi-channels in our digital spectrum.
Distribution Agreements.  We have distribution agreements with Distributors and other OTT distributors who compensate us for the right to retransmit our stations and other offerings on their respective distribution platforms. Our successful negotiations with Distributors and other OTT distributors have created agreements that produce meaningful sustainable revenue streams. We intend to maintain the strong relationships with our Distributors and other OTT distributors and believe our local news, sports, and entertainment content positions us to continue to expand our agreements within all of these distribution platforms. However, we cannot guarantee that some Distributors and other OTT distributors will not drop carriage of our channels or continue to experience elevated levels of subscriber churn. 
Improvement and Maintenance of Broadcast Infrastructure. Our Dielectric subsidiary is a leader in servicing and manufacturing broadcast infrastructure. As a result, we maintain a strong infrastructure through which we provide high quality uninterrupted content on our stations. This subsidiary is critical in the build-out of the infrastructure behind NextGen TV for both our stations and other broadcasters.
Developing New Business.  We strive to develop new business models to complement or enhance our traditional television broadcast business. We have developed new ways to sell online, mobile text messaging, social media advertising, and audience extension services along with our traditional commercial broadcasting model. Additionally, we continue to leverage our national reach to provide new high-quality content to our local communities.
We continue to expand our digital distribution platforms through initiatives such as our video management system, which simplifies and automates our broadcast-to-digital streaming workflow and allows for dynamic replacement of broadcast ads with digital ads targeted to each individual viewer and allows us to ingest and redistribute content across our platform so that we can break news first. By using a single ad-serving system across all of our web sites, mobile apps, and other digital assets, we are able to streamline our sales workflow, optimize yield, and deliver comprehensive sales opportunities across our digital footprint. Additionally, we are deploying DTC and OTT initiatives as well as our own content applications.
In 2022, we announced a broad, multi-platform creative partnership with Anthony E. Zuiker to create content across a range of formats and subjects, as discussed in more detail above in Owned Networks and Content. 
Additionally, we continue to develop business opportunities, products, and services associated with NextGen TV (also known as ATSC 3.0) as discussed under Development of Next Generation Wireless Platform below.
 In November 2020, we entered into agreements for a long-term strategic partnership with Bally's. as discussed in more detail above in Digital and Internet. 
Strategic Realignment of Media Portfolio.  We routinely review potential media acquisitions, dispositions, and swaps, or develop original networks and content. We expect to continue to assess acquisition and investment opportunities to complement our existing stations and other businesses. As we evaluate potential acquisitions and investments, we intend to focus on making disciplined, accretive acquisitions and investments that will complement our existing portfolio of television stations while providing increased scale. At any given time, we may be in discussions with one or more media owners.
Digital and Internet Expansion of Broadcast Segment. Our digital properties, Compulse and NewsON are innovative products and extensions of our core broadcast business that allow us to compete for digital, internet, network, and print impressions and revenues. We continue to seek additional opportunities to invest in emerging digital technologies, ad tech, and digital content companies that support and expand our digital capabilities and non-linear footprint.
Development of Next Generation Wireless Platform. In 2017, the FCC approved the use of NextGen TV, a next generation broadcast transmission standard. NextGen TV is capable of merging broadcast and broadband content and data services using over-the-air spectrum and Internet-provided data connectivity, allowing a mature broadcast industry to reinvent itself due to its mobility, addressability, capacity, Internet Protocol ("IP") connectivity, and conditional access.
NextGen TV will allow us to use our spectrum for more than just video-formatted data as we do today. As a data-agnostic IP based pipe, we also will be able to distribute data including text, audio, video, and software. While our one-to-many architecture will remain a strength, we will be able to deliver "the last mile" from program/data origination to the consumer's receiver device across a more robust system, connect legacy ATSC 1.0 televisions to NextGen TV using broadcast hot spots and wi-fi functionality, and provide compatible data-offload service offerings in conjunction with certain 5G platforms. Among the many emerging opportunities are hyper-local news, weather, and traffic; dynamic ad insertion; geographic and demographic-targeted advertising; customizable content; better measurement and analytics; the ability to interface with devices connected to the Internet; flexibility to add streams as needed; substantially enhanced picture quality with immersive audio; connectivity to automobiles, including 3D mapping, telematics and infotainment; geo-location services; enhanced GPS; distance e-learning; data wholesale models; and other content delivery networks. Conditional access capabilities also permit broadcasters to offer secure "skinny-bundle" pay services as well as various video-on-demand type offerings. In addition, NextGen TV provides new emergency and information capabilities, including advanced alerting functions which can provide crucial rich media including evacuation routes and device wake-up features. All of these features will be available to mobile and portable devices, allowing us to reach viewers virtually anywhere. In January 2020, we announced the formation of CAST.ERA, a joint venture with SK Telecom, focused on cloud infrastructure for broadcasting, ultra-low latency OTT broadcasting, and targeted advertising.
In order to bring this technology to the market, we have partnered with technology leaders to develop broadcasting solutions and services in the U.S. and globally. We have also formed BitPath, a joint venture with another broadcaster, to promote spectrum efficiency and innovation, aggregate and monetize underutilized spectrum capacity over which to deliver national services, and create opportunities such as robust video and data exchange. We continue to work with other NextGen TV stakeholders to build and test the single frequency network tower infrastructure, develop systems to allow the convergence of NextGen TV and 5G data delivery, and design NextGen TV receiver chips for mobile, portable and fixed devices. We expect the implementation and adoption of NextGen TV to occur over the next two years. In 2020, we and the industry began deployment of NextGen TV capabilities on some of our own television facilities and in conjunction with other station operators in our markets, as well as non-Sinclair markets. To date, NextGen TV is broadcasting in more than 60 markets, including 36 of our markets. When completed, the country will have a lower-cost, world class wireless IP data distribution network capable of supporting multiple business models.
Monetization of Certain Intellectual Property Rights. We have developed, through our ONE Media, LLC subsidiary, several NextGen Broadcast-related patents that we intend to monetize directly, through third-party agents, or through a patent pool designed to consolidate similar patents owned by independent licensors for licensing to equipment manufacturers.
FEDERAL REGULATION OF TELEVISION BROADCASTING
The ownership, operation, and sale of television stations are subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC, which acts under the authority granted by the Communications Act of 1934, as amended ("the Communications Act"). Among other things, the FCC assigns frequency bands for broadcasting; determines the particular frequencies, locations, and operating power of stations; issues, renews, revokes, and modifies station licenses; regulates equipment used by stations; adopts and implements regulations and policies that directly or indirectly affect the ownership, operation, and employment practices of stations; and has the power to impose penalties for violations of its rules and regulations of the Communications Act.
The following is a summary of certain provisions of the Communications Act and specific FCC regulations and policies. Reference should be made to the Communications Act, FCC rules, and the public notices and rulings of the FCC for further information concerning the nature and extent of federal regulation of broadcast stations.
License Grant and Renewal
Television stations operate pursuant to broadcasting licenses that are granted by the FCC for maximum terms of eight years and are subject to renewal upon application to the FCC. During certain periods when renewal applications are pending, petitions to deny license renewals can be filed by interested parties, including members of the public.
Although historically renewal of a license is granted in the vast majority of cases, even when petitions to deny are filed, there can be no assurance that the license of any station will be renewed or, if renewed, that the renewal terms will be for the maximum term permitted.
In the last completed license renewal cycle, all of our stations' license renewal applications were granted for the maximum term permitted. The current television license renewal application cycle began on June 1, 2020. On September 1, 2020, an individual filed a petition to deny the license renewal application of our Baltimore, MD station, WBFF(TV), and the renewal applications of two Baltimore stations with which we have a JSA or LMA, WUTB(TV) and WNUV(TV). We filed an opposition to the petition on October 1, 2020 with respect to WBFF(TV), and the petition remains pending at this time. We cannot predict when the FCC will take action on the petition or what the outcome of such action will be. To date, we have timely filed all renewal applications due for our stations during this renewal application cycle.
Ownership Matters
General. The Communications Act prohibits the assignment of a broadcast license or the transfer of control of a broadcast licensee without the prior approval of the FCC. In determining whether to permit the assignment or transfer of control of, or the grant or renewal of, a broadcast license, the FCC considers a number of factors pertaining to the licensee, including compliance with various rules limiting common ownership of media properties, the "character" of the licensee and those persons holding "attributable" interests in that licensee and compliance with the Communications Act's limitations on foreign ownership. The FCC has indicated that in order to approve an assignment or transfer of a broadcast license the FCC must make an affirmative determination that the proposed transaction serves the public interest, not merely that the transaction does not violate its rules or shares factual elements with other transactions previously approved by the FCC, and that it may deny a transaction if it determines that the transaction would not be in the public interest.
The FCC generally applies its ownership limits to "attributable" interests held by an individual, corporation, partnership or other association. In the case of corporations holding, or through subsidiaries controlling, broadcast licenses, the interests of officers, directors and those who, directly or indirectly, have the right to vote 5% or more of the corporation’s stock (or 20% or more of such stock in the case of insurance companies, investment companies and bank trust departments that are passive investors) are generally attributable. In addition, pursuant to what is known as the equity-debt-plus rule, a major programming supplier or same-market media entity will be an attributable owner of a station if the supplier or same-market media entity holds debt or equity, or both, in the station that is greater than 33% of the value of the station’s total debt plus equity. Further, the Communications Act generally prohibits foreign parties from having more than a 20% interest (voting or equity) in a broadcast licensee or more than a 25% interest in the parent of that licensee without receiving prior FCC approval to exceed these limits. Following a Declaratory Ruling in 2013 in which the FCC indicated that it was open to considering proposals for foreign investment in broadcast licenses that exceed the 25% benchmark on a case by case basis, on September 29, 2016, the FCC adopted a Report and Order which among other things, (i) simplified the foreign ownership approval process for broadcast licensees seeking to exceed the 25% benchmark and (ii) modified the methodology a licensee may use to determine compliance with the foreign ownership rules.
We and our subsidiaries are domestic entities, and the members of the Smith family (who, as of December 31, 2022, together hold approximately 80.8% of the common voting rights of Sinclair) are all United States citizens. Our articles of incorporation contain limitations on alien ownership and control that are substantially similar to those contained in the Communications Act. Pursuant to the articles of incorporation, we have the right to repurchase alien-owned shares at their fair market value to the extent necessary, in the judgment of the Board of Directors, to comply with the alien ownership restrictions.
Additional ownership rules as currently in effect are as follows:
Radio / Television Cross-Ownership Rule and Newspaper / Broadcast Cross-Ownership Rule. Until February 2018, the FCC's rules (i) limited the combined number of television and radio stations a party could own in a market to up to two television stations and six radio stations, depending on the number of independent media voices in the market ("radio/television cross-ownership rule"), and (ii) prohibited the common ownership of a radio or television broadcast station and a daily newspaper in the same market ("newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule"). On November 20, 2017, the FCC released an Order on Reconsideration ("Ownership Order on Reconsideration") that, among other changes, eliminated the radio/television cross-ownership rule and the newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule. The rule changes adopted in the Ownership Order on Reconsideration became effective on February 7, 2018. The Ownership Order on Reconsideration was vacated and remanded by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in September 2019, but the Supreme Court ultimately reversed the Third Circuit’s decision on April 1, 2021 and the Ownership Order on Reconsideration is currently in effect.
National Ownership Rule. The national television viewing audience reach cap is 39%. Under this rule, where an individual or entity has an attributable interest in more than one television station in a market, the percentage of the national television viewing audience encompassed within that market is only counted once. Additionally, because VHF stations (channels 2 through 13) historically covered a larger portion of the market than UHF stations (channels 14 through 51), only half of the households in the market area of any UHF station are included when calculating an entity’s national television viewing audience (commonly referred to as the "UHF discount"). On December 18, 2017, the FCC released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to examine the national ownership rule, including the UHF discount. The rulemaking proceeding remains pending. We cannot predict the outcome of the rulemaking proceeding. 
The majority of the stations we own and operate, or to which we provide programming services, are UHF. With the UHF discount, our current reach (for FCC purposes) is approximately 24% of U.S. households. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of the risk related to the outcome of rules governing the UHF discount.
Local Television Ownership Rule. A party may own television stations in adjoining markets, even if there is a digital noise limited service contour overlap between the two stations’ broadcast signals, and generally may own two stations in the same market ("local television ownership rule") only (i) if there is no digital overlap between the stations; or (ii) not more than one station is among the top-four rated stations in the market ("the top-four rule"). The Ownership Order on Reconsideration modified the top-four rule to permit parties to own up to two top-four rated stations in the same market on a case-by-case basis. 
Local Marketing and Outsourcing Agreements
Certain of our stations have entered into agreements with other stations in the same market, through which we provide programming and operating services pursuant to LMAs or provide sales services and other non-programming operating services pursuant to outsourcing agreements, such as JSAs and SSAs. LMAs are attributable where a licensee holds an attributable interest in a television station and (i) programs more than 15% of the weekly broadcast hours and/or (ii) sells more than 15% of the weekly advertising time on another television station in the same market. LMAs existing prior to November 5, 1996, which include all of our LMAs, are currently exempt from attribution until further FCC action. If the FCC were to eliminate the exemption for these LMAs, we would have to terminate or modify these LMAs. JSAs and SSAs currently are not attributable. 
In August 2016, the FCC completed both its 2010 and 2014 Quadrennial Regulatory Reviews of its media ownership rules and issued an order ("Ownership Order") which left most of the existing multiple ownership rules intact, but amended the rules to provide for the attribution of JSAs under certain circumstances. Certain existing JSAs were later exempted from attribution until 2025. The subsequent Ownership Order on Reconsideration eliminated the JSA attribution rule. If we are required to terminate or modify our LMAs or JSAs, our business could be adversely affected in several ways, including losses on investments and termination penalties. For more information on the risks, see "The FCC's multiple ownership rules and federal antitrust regulation may limit our ability to operate multiple television stations in some markets and may result in a reduction in our revenue or prevent us from reducing costs. Changes in these rules may threaten our existing strategic approach to certain television markets." under Item 1A. Risk Factors and Changes in the Rules of Television Ownership, Local Marketing Agreements, Joint Sales Agreements, Retransmission Consent Negotiations, and National Ownership Cap under Note 13. Commitments and Contingencies within the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
Antitrust Regulation. The Department of Justice ("DOJ") and the Federal Trade Commission have increased their scrutiny of the television industry and have reviewed matters related to the concentration of ownership within markets (including "LMAs" and "outsourcing agreements") even when ownership or the LMA or other outsourcing agreement in question is permitted under the laws administered by the FCC or by FCC rules and regulations. The DOJ takes the position that an LMA or other outsourcing agreement entered into in anticipation of a station’s acquisition with the proposed buyer of the station constitutes a change in beneficial ownership of the station which, if subject to filing under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, cannot be implemented until the waiting period required by that statute has ended or been terminated.
On January 4, 2019, the Company received three civil investigative demands ("CIDs") from the Antitrust Division of the DOJ. We believe the DOJ has similar CIDs to other companies in our industry. In each CID, the DOJ requested that the Company produce certain documents and materials relating to JSAs in a specific DMA. On July 1, 2021, the DOJ Antitrust Division advised the Company that it had closed the JSA investigation with respect to the Company without action.
Satellite Carriage
The Satellite Home Viewer Act, as extended by The Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act of 1999, the Satellite Home Viewer Extension and Reauthorization Act, the Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act of 2010 and the Satellite Television Extension and Localism Act Reauthorization Act of 2014 ("STELAR") among other things, (i) allows satellite carriers to provide local television signals by satellite within a station market, and requires them to carry all local signals that asserted carriage rights in any market where they carry any local signals, (ii) requires all television stations to elect to exercise certain “must-carry” or “retransmission consent” rights in connection with their carriage by satellite carriers, and (iii) authorizes satellite delivery of distant network signals, significantly viewed signals and local low-power television station signals into local markets under defined circumstances. In adopting fiscal year 2020 appropriations legislation, Congress allowed STELAR to sunset on December 31, 2019 but made permanent STELAR’s (1) requirements that broadcasters and Distributors negotiate retransmission content in good faith and (2) distant signal satellite license provisions for recreational vehicles, truckers, tailgaters and short markets.
Must-Carry / Retransmission Consent
Television broadcasters are required to make triennial elections to exercise either certain "must-carry" or "retransmission consent" rights in connection with their carriage by cable systems in each broadcaster’s local market. By electing to exercise must-carry rights, a broadcaster demands carriage and receives a specific channel on cable systems within its DMA. Must carry rights are not absolute and are dependent on a number of factors which may or may not be present in a particular case. Alternatively, if a broadcaster chooses to exercise retransmission consent rights, it can prohibit cable systems from carrying its signal or grant the appropriate cable system the authority to retransmit the broadcast signal for a fee or other consideration. We have elected to exercise our retransmission consent rights with respect to all of our stations. In February 2015, the FCC issued an order implementing certain statutorily required changes to its rules governing the duty to negotiate retransmission consent agreements in good faith. Under these rules, unless the stations are directly or indirectly under common de jure control as permitted under the FCC regulations, a station may not delegate authority to negotiate or approve a retransmission consent agreement to a station located in the same market or to a third party that negotiates together with another television station in the same market, nor may stations in the same market facilitate or agree to facilitate coordinated negotiation of retransmission consent terms for their stations in that market, including through the sharing of information. In May 2020, the FCC revised its good faith negotiation rules to specify that certain small MVPDs can meet the obligation to negotiate in good faith by negotiating with a large station group through a qualified MVPD buying group and that large station groups have an obligation to negotiate in good faith with such MVPD buying groups.
Further, in September 2015, the FCC released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in response to a Congressional directive in STELAR to examine the "totality of the circumstances test" for good-faith negotiations of retransmission consent. The proposed rulemaking sought comment on new factors and evidence to consider in its evaluation of claims of bad faith negotiation, including service interruptions prior to a "marquee sports or entertainment event," restrictions on online access to broadcast programming during negotiation impasses, broadcasters' ability to offer bundles of broadcast signals with other broadcast stations or cable networks, and broadcasters’ ability to invoke the FCC’s exclusivity rules during service interruptions. On July 14, 2016, the FCC's then-Chairman Wheeler announced that the FCC would not, at that time, proceed to adopt additional rules governing good faith negotiations of retransmission consent. No formal action has yet been taken on this Proposed Rulemaking, and we cannot predict if the FCC will terminate the Rulemaking or take other action.
Network Non-Duplication / Syndicated Exclusivity / Territorial Exclusivity
The FCC’s syndicated exclusivity rules allow local broadcast television stations to demand that cable operators black out syndicated non-network programming carried on "distant signals" (i.e., signals of broadcast stations, including so-called "superstations," which serve areas substantially removed from the cable systems’ local community). The FCC’s network non-duplication rules allow local broadcast, network affiliated stations to require that cable operators black out duplicate network programming carried on distant signals. Both rules are subject to various exceptions and limitations.  In a number of markets in which we own or program stations affiliated with a network, a station that is affiliated with the same network in a nearby market is carried on cable systems in our markets. Such significantly viewed signals are not subject to black out pursuant to the FCC's network non-duplication rules.  The carriage of two network stations on the same cable system could result in a decline of viewership, adversely affecting the revenues of our owned or programmed stations. In March 2014, the FCC issued a Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, requesting comments on whether it has authority to, and should, eliminate or modify its network non-duplication and/or syndicated exclusivity rules. This proceeding is pending and we cannot predict when or how the FCC will resolve that rulemaking. The FCC's syndicated exclusivity rules allow local broadcast television stations to demand that cable operators black out syndicated non-network programming carried on "distant signals" (i.e., signals of broadcast stations, including so-called "superstations," which serve areas substantially removed from the cable systems' local community).

In March 2014, the FCC issued a Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, requesting comments on whether it has authority to, and should, eliminate or modify its network non-duplication and/or syndicated exclusivity rules. This proceeding is pending and we cannot predict when or how the FCC will resolve that rulemaking.
Digital Television
FCC rules provide that television broadcast licensees may use their digital television ("DTV") channels for a wide variety of services such as HD television, multiple standard definition television programming, audio, data, and other types of communications, subject to the requirement that each broadcaster provide at least one free video channel equal in quality to the current technical standard and further subject to the requirement that broadcasters pay a fee of 5% of gross revenues from any DTV ancillary or supplementary service for which there is a subscription fee or for which the licensee receives a fee from a third party. These rules could impact the profitability related to ancillary or supplementary services provided as discussed within Development of Next Generation Wireless Platform under Operating Strategy above. In addition, possible new rules with respect to multicasting as discussed within Other Pending Matters below could impact the way we currently use our DTV channels and the services we are able to offer on those channels. 
Programming and Operations
The Communications Act requires broadcasters to serve the "public interest." The FCC has relaxed or eliminated many of the more formalized procedures it had developed in the past to promote the broadcast of certain types of programming responsive to the needs of a station’s community of license. FCC licensees continue to be required, however, to present programming that is responsive to the needs and interests of their communities and to maintain certain records demonstrating such responsiveness. Complaints from viewers concerning a station’s programming may be considered by the FCC when it evaluates renewal applications of a licensee, although such complaints may be filed at any time and generally may be considered by the FCC at any time. Stations also must pay regulatory and application fees and follow various rules promulgated under the Communications Act that regulate, among other things, political advertising, sponsorship identifications, obscene and indecent broadcasts, and technical operations, including limits on radio frequency radiation. In addition, television licensees have obligations to create and follow employment outreach programs, provide a minimum amount of programming for children, comply with rules relating to the emergency alert system, maintain an online public inspection file, and abide by regulations specifying requirements to provide closed captions for its programming. FCC licensees are, in general, responsible for the content of their broadcast programming, including that supplied by television networks. Accordingly, there is a risk of being fined as a result of our broadcast programming, including network programming.
Other Pending Matters
Congress and the FCC have under consideration, and in the future may consider and adopt, new laws, regulations, and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could affect, directly or indirectly, the operation, ownership, and profitability of our broadcast stations, result in the loss of audience share and advertising revenues for our broadcast stations, and affect our ability to acquire additional broadcast stations or finance such acquisitions.
On November 16, 2017, the FCC adopted a Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking authorizing the voluntary deployment of NextGen TV and adopting rules to afford broadcasters flexibility to deploy NextGen TV based transmissions while minimizing impact on consumers and industry stakeholders and seeking comment on certain additional matters. On June 3, 2020, the FCC adopted the Second Report and Order and Order on Reconsideration, providing additional guidance to broadcasters deploying NextGen TV. On November 9, 2020, the National Association of Broadcasters filed a Petition for Declaratory Ruling and Petition for Rulemaking requesting that the FCC (1) clarify that its existing regulatory framework for the hosting of simulcast primary programming streams also applies to simulcast multicast streams, and (2) expand the application of these rules to cover the transmission of ATSC 1.0 multicast streams regardless of whether those streams are simulcast in ATSC 3.0. On November 5, 2021, the FCC released a Second Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking comment on these multicast host station licensing issues, and on June 22, 2022, the FCC released a Third Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking comment on the state of the ATSC 3.0 transition and the scheduled sunsets of two rules adopted in the 2017 Report and Order. These rulemaking proceedings remain pending. We cannot predict what the outcome of the proceedings will be. 
On December 13, 2018, the FCC released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to initiate the 2018 Quadrennial Regulatory Review of the FCC's broadcast ownership rules, pursuant to the statutory requirement that the FCC review its media ownership rules every four years to determine whether they remain "necessary in the public interest as the result of competition." The proposed rulemaking generally seeks comment on, among other things, whether the local television ownership rules (including the top-four rule and the eight voices test), should be retained, modified, or eliminated. With respect to the local television ownership rule specifically, among other things, the proposed rulemaking seeks comment on possible modifications to the rule’s operation, including the relevant product market, the numerical limit, the top-four prohibition; and the implications of multicasting, satellite stations, low power stations and the next generation standard. In addition, the proposed rulemaking examines further several diversity related proposals raised in the 2014 Quadrennial Regulatory Review. On July 16, 2021, the FCC extended the public comment period and the comment and reply comment deadline closed on October 1, 2021. The rulemaking remains pending. On December 22, 2022, the FCC released a Public Notice to initiate the 2022 Quadrennial Regulatory Review despite the pendency of the 2018 Quadrennial Review, seeking comment on the Local Radio Ownership Rule, the Local Television Ownership Rule, and the Dual Network Rule. Comments are due on March 3, 2023 and reply comments are due March 20, 2023.
Other matters that could affect our broadcast properties include technological innovations and developments generally affecting competition in the mass communications industry, such as DTC offerings, direct television broadcast satellite service, Class A television service, the continued establishment of wireless cable systems and low power television stations, digital television technologies, the internet and mobility, and portability of our broadcast signal to hand-held devices.
Other Considerations
The preceding summary is not a complete discussion of all provisions of the Communications Act or other congressional acts or of the regulations and policies of the FCC, or in some cases, the DOJ. For further information, reference should be made to the Communications Act, other congressional acts and regulations, and public notices circulated from time to time by the FCC, or in some cases, the DOJ. There are additional regulations and policies of the FCC and other federal agencies that govern political broadcasts, advertising, equal employment opportunity, and other matters affecting our business and operations.
ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION

Prior to our ownership or operation of our facilities, substances or waste that are, or might be considered, hazardous under applicable environmental laws may have been generated, used, stored, or disposed of at certain of those facilities. In addition, environmental conditions relating to the soil and groundwater at or under our facilities may be affected by the proximity of nearby properties that have generated, used, stored, or disposed of hazardous substances. As a result, it is possible that we could become subject to environmental liabilities in the future in connection with these facilities under applicable environmental laws and regulations. Although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with such environmental requirements and have not in the past been required to incur significant costs in connection therewith, there can be no assurance that our costs to comply with such requirements will not increase in the future or that we will not become subject to new governmental regulations, including those pertaining to potential climate change legislation, that may impose additional restrictions or costs on us. We presently believe that none of our properties have any condition that is likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of operations, or consolidated statements of cash flows.
COMPETITION
Our stations compete for audience share and advertising revenue with other television stations and cable networks in their markets, as well as with other advertising media such as Distributors, other OTT distributors, cable networks, video on-demand, radio, newspapers, magazines, outdoor advertising, transit advertising, telecommunications providers, direct mail, internet, podcasts, other digital media, and 'Big Tech'.

Stations compete for audience share primarily on the basis of program popularity, which has a direct effect on advertising rates.
Our network affiliated stations are largely dependent upon the performance of network provided programs in order to attract viewers. Non-network time periods are programmed by the station primarily with syndicated programs purchased for cash, cash and barter, or barter-only, as well as through self-produced news, public affairs programs, live local sporting events, paid-programming, and other lifestyle and entertainment programming. We also compete for programming which involves negotiating with national program distributors or syndicators that sell first-run and rerun packages of programming. Our stations compete for access to those programs against in-market broadcast station competitors for syndicated products and with national cable networks. Public broadcasting stations generally compete with commercial broadcasters for viewers, but not for advertising dollars.
Competition in the television broadcasting industry occurs primarily in individual DMAs. Generally, a television broadcasting station in one DMA does not compete with stations in other DMAs. Our stations are located in highly competitive DMAs. Distributors can increase competition for viewership and broadcast television advertising inventory by carrying additional cable network channels within the same DMA as the broadcast television stations. Distributors sell advertising on these cable networks to local advertisers. These narrow cable network channels are typically low rated, and, as a result, advertisements are inexpensive to the local advertisers. Distributors may also connect two or more cable systems together, also called an interconnect, which gives advertisers the option to reach more households in a market with a single buy. In addition, certain of our DMAs are overlapped by over-the-air stations from adjacent DMAs and Distributors of stations from other DMAs, which tends to spread viewership and advertising expenditures over a larger number of television stations. In addition, there is significant increased competition with Google, Facebook, social media, OTT offerings, and the multitude of other digital offerings that air video advertisements and sell programmatically to agencies and advertisers. Distributor and OTT offerings have the ability to either blanket the market or target their advertising which broadcast stations do not. 
Advertising rates are based upon factors which include the size of the market in which the stations operate; a program's popularity among the viewers that an advertiser wishes to attract; the number of advertisers competing for the available time; the demographic makeup of the market served by the stations; the availability of alternative advertising media in the DMA; the aggressiveness and knowledge of the sales forces in the market to call on and understand their client’s need; and development of projects, features, and programs that tie advertiser messages to programming. We believe that our sales and programming strategies allow us to compete effectively for advertising revenues within the stations' markets.
Further, the competition of obtaining distribution is highly competitive. Our stations face competition from other television stations and cable networks for the right to be carried by a particular distributor, and for the right to be carried on the service tier that will attract the most subscribers. Once one of our stations obtains distribution, that network competes for viewers not only with the other channels available through the distributor, but also with over-the-air television, pay-per-view channels and video-on-demand channels, as well as online services, mobile services, radio, print, streaming services, and other sources of media and information, sporting events, and entertainment. Important to our success in each area of competition the station faces are the price the station charges for its carriage; the quantity, quality, and variety of programming offered; and the effectiveness of its marketing efforts.
Our stations' ability to successfully compete with other television stations and cable networks for distribution may be hampered because the Distributors, through which distribution is sought, may be affiliated with other television stations, broadcast networks, or cable networks. Those Distributors may place their affiliated television station or cable network on a more desirable tier, thereby giving the affiliated television station or cable network a competitive advantage over our stations' own programming. Additionally, broadcast networks putting programming content on their own DTC platforms may also hinder our stations' ability to successfully compete within the broadcast market. 

Moreover, technological advances and regulatory changes affecting programming delivery through fiber optic lines, video compression, and new wireless uses could lower entry barriers for new video channels and encourage the further development of increasingly specialized "niche" programming. Telecommunication companies are permitted to provide video distribution services, on a common carrier basis, as "cable systems" or as "open video systems," each pursuant to different regulatory schemes. Additionally, OTT services allow consumers to consume programming on-demand through access to the Internet and without a subscription with a Distributor. We continue to compete with the OTT services for viewership.
DTV technology allows our stations to provide viewers multiple channels of digital television over each of our existing standard digital channels, to provide certain programming in HD television format and to deliver other channels of information in the forms of data and programming to the internet, PCs, smart phones, tablet computers, and mobile and streaming devices.  These additional capabilities may provide us with additional sources of revenue, as well as additional competition.
The financial success of our stations also depends in part upon unpredictable and volatile factors beyond our control, such as viewer preferences, the strength of the advertising market, the quality and appeal of competing programming, and the availability of other entertainment activities. 
We believe we compete favorably against other television stations and cable networks because of our management skill and experience, our ability historically to generate revenue share greater than our audience share, our network affiliations and program service arrangements, and our local program acceptance.  In addition, we believe that we benefit from the operation of multiple broadcast and network properties, affording us certain non-quantifiable economies of scale and competitive advantages in the purchase of programming.
ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, AND GOVERNANCE ACTIVITIES AND PRACTICES
We have a long history of supporting environmental, social, and governance ("ESG") activities and, in the past few years, we have taken steps to better measure and quantify our progress in these areas. In addition to our ESG Committee, which is made up of executive leadership, we have also formed working groups in the areas of sustainability, employee experience, and diversity and inclusion.
Human Capital

Our success is driven by our most important asset - our employees. It is their hard work and dedication that enables us to be a trusted partner to our viewers and a valuable resource to our communities. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 7,900 employees, including part-time and temporary employees. Approximately 620 employees are represented by labor unions under certain collective bargaining agreements.
We support our employees by ensuring that we provide a fair, ethical, and safe workplace.
•We take pride in our practices to ensure the safety, health, and well-being of our employees. We maintain best practices for safety and health through policies and procedures and access to our employee assistance program.
•Our employment practices are rooted in our policies against discrimination, harassment, and retaliation to ensure a positive working environment for all. 
•We are committed to an ethical workplace and provide our employees with guidance and reporting mechanisms to foster a culture of honesty and accountability.
•We provide our employees a comprehensive benefits package, recognition for their efforts, and resources to enable and enhance learning and development, and we have worked hard to ensure we provide a workplace where employees can feel that they belong.
Corporate Culture. We are committed to maintaining a safe, ethical, and harassment-free workplace. We recognize that our success as a team, and in our communications with one another, is grounded in our ability to trust team members to be fully engaged and to do the right thing. We support trusting relationships by offering clear guidance, structure, resources, and accountability. To this end, we maintain governance policies that apply to all of our directors, officers, and employees, including a code of business conduct and ethics, employee safety program, and no harassment and open-door policies. These policies are intended to identify, provide mechanisms for reporting, and provide a framework for solving potential issues. These policies are reviewed and updated by management, together with the Board, as our needs grow and change and upon stakeholder feedback and changes in applicable laws, regulations, and stock exchange requirements.
We value and support diversity and inclusion at all levels. Diversity and inclusion have been fundamental from our very beginning and we take pride in being an equal opportunity employer. Diversity, inclusion, equal employment opportunity, and strong anti-discrimination policies go hand-in-hand. Our Diversity and Inclusion Statement establishes clarity and alignment throughout our organization, at all levels, regarding how we connect with each other by embracing diversity and promoting inclusion among our employees, viewers, and customers. All employees are asked to honor the intent of our Diversity and Inclusion Statement in their daily activities and decisions and are required to take part in workplace diversity training.
Over several decades, our local television stations have built recruiting and outreach programs that encourage diversity in our workforce. Our activities are designed to ensure broad outreach to potential applicants by widely disseminating information concerning job vacancies, providing notification to community groups, attending diverse job fairs, participating in other various recruitment outreach activities, offering paid internships, and providing training to managers on equal employment opportunity and discrimination prevention. 
Employee Engagement. We regularly gather feedback from employees to gain an understanding of and improve our employee experience and to foster an engaged workforce. This feedback is used to help create new, and refine existing, employee related programs and processes.
Sinclair takes a strategic approach to talent development. We provide on-the-job training and other learning opportunities to employees so that they gain and develop necessary skills for optimal job performance and to foster a creative and collaborative work environment. Our learning and development platform, Sinclair University, allows employees to access a vast collection of learning and development content. During 2022, we expanded employee's access to online courses for learning and development and instituted a program to encourage employees to complete areas of professional development. We also provide leadership development through targeted training programs. In addition, many of our leaders have their own employee development offerings, specific to their department and position.
We actively promote our internal job announcement program as a part of our efforts to support employee growth by taking on new career opportunities within Sinclair.
Our innovation project is a strategic lever that drives revenue, reduces waste, and engages employees to serve our customers and shareholders as a pioneer in the industry. We believe that the "next big idea" could come from anyone or anywhere and with this in mind, in 2020 we began an effort to gather innovation ideas from employees company-wide. In 2022, we launched a dedicated team that will build on our rich history of innovation to accelerate efforts across content, technology, audience development, distribution, marketing services, and business transformation. This new Innovation & Strategy team brought over 200 innovators together at our annual Innovation Summit in 2022, where we took dedicated time to celebrate our legacy of innovation and dive deeper into our growth pillars: Multi-Platform Content, Marketing Services, Data Distribution, and Interactivity & Community.
Health, Safety, and Wellness. The health, safety, and wellness of our employees is vital to our success and we maintain and continuously enhance affordable health care options for them. We continuously work to improve our practices, policies, and benefits to make meaningful impacts on our employees personal and professional lives, sponsoring an employee assistance program aimed at enhancing their physical, financial, and mental well-being. During 2022, we began a new program to provide employees and spouses discounted access to fitness facilities.
Compensation. Our employee compensation includes market-competitive pay, a 401(k) plan, an employee stock purchase plan, healthcare benefits, paid time off and family leave, and employer paid life and disability insurance. We continue to improve our compensation offerings. In 2022, we added two additional Company observed holidays, bringing the total number of Company observed holidays to nine; increased the minimum vacation accrual from two-weeks to three-weeks; increased paid parental leave from one week to six weeks; and again offered our employees the opportunity for additional time off through the Vacation Exchange Program.
Social Responsibility
As a local news broadcaster, we believe it is our responsibility to raise issues of local importance, through deep investigative reporting at our stations, and provide critical and relevant information to our viewers, including crucial news updates during potentially life-threatening situations when our viewers need them most. During 2022, our stations received 290 journalism awards, including 74 regional Emmy awards, and 24 Regional and two National RTDNA Edward R. Murrow awards which are awarded to recognize local and national news stories that uphold ethics, demonstrate technical expertise, and exemplify the importance and impact of journalism as a service to the community. More importantly than its award recognition is the impact our reporting has on the communities we serve. We are committed to getting results for the people living in the communities we serve. Our journalists' ground-breaking reporting has prompted government investigations as well as changes in government policies and new state and federal laws. Our unique reporting in under-served arenas has sparked much-needed public engagement on topics of high local importance and concern. WBFF's "Project Baltimore," which is now heading into its seventh year in 2023, has uncovered systemic failures within the Baltimore County and Baltimore City Public School Systems, resulting in investigations into the falsifying of report cards, inaccurate nurse timesheets, and violations of federal disability laws by the Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Education and the Maryland Inspector General for Education. Our national investigative team, "Spotlight on America," in conjunction with WJLA and WJLA's "Inside Your World Investigates," continue to reveal toxic forever chemicals and other dangerous pollutants negatively impacting water, food supplies, and consumer products, which cause significant health risks for people throughout the United States and especially U.S. Military personnel. These stories and countless others are examples of our ongoing commitment to relentless accountability reporting on behalf of voiceless viewers who live in the communities we are proud to serve.
Connect to Congress is our multimedia initiative that enables Members of Congress from our news markets to speak directly to their constituents on a regular basis, through their local TV news stations. The initiative, which launched in 2015, offers our local market viewers new ways to get answers to questions about what matters most to them at home. Each Wednesday when Congress is in session, we set up cameras in the Capitol Rotunda, connected remotely to our local stations, with anchors and reporters conducting interviews with lawmakers about the key issues affecting constituents, connecting our local stations directly to Congress. This also offers the hundreds of Congressional Members in our news markets their own media voice in their home districts. On average, over 300 interviews are conducted through Connect to Congress each year.
This is our 10th year of producing our community "Your Voice Your Future" Town Halls. These Town Halls are produced in the local markets and give our viewers an opportunity to have a voice and ask their elected leaders questions on important local and national topics. In 2022 and 2021 we produced 198 and 162 Town Halls, respectively, throughout the country, covering a variety of topics including crime, police funding, police shortages, affordable housing, mental health, opioids, bullying, finance, and human trafficking. In 2022, we organized 56 political debates featuring gubernatorial, mayoral, senatorial, and congressional races as well as School Superintendent in Oklahoma City and school board positions in Virginia. Since launching our commitment to give a voice to our viewers, our Town Halls have produced 1,198 productions to educate and address the needs of our audience.
We have steadfast dedication to providing content that alerts, protects, and empowers our audience. Distinctive, Disruptive, and Disciplined; these three simple words carry a great deal of weight as we meet the demands of today’s news consumer.
We believe it is our responsibility to be involved in our local communities. Sinclair Cares is our Company-wide community service and relief campaign program, which utilizes the strength of our properties to uplift organizations and inspire our audiences and employees to make a positive impact in our communities. Sinclair Cares mobilizes Sinclair’s assets to support various community and charitable endeavors and responses to natural disasters through financial assistance, volunteerism, and raising awareness of important topics through our media platforms. Over the last six years, Sinclair Cares has spearheaded the company’s efforts, including fund-raising and blood donations during weather and climate catastrophes, and raising funds and awareness for important social causes. Recent initiatives include:
•Sinclair Cares: Ukraine Relief - a fundraising partnership with Global Red Cross to help with their humanitarian relief efforts on the ground in Ukraine and neighboring countries. In one week, over $215,000 was raised, including a $50,000 donation from the Company.
•Sinclair Cares: Supporting All Veterans - a partnership with the Disabled American Veterans (DAV) with the goal of increasing support for our nation’s veterans, we encouraged employees and viewers to volunteer to support veterans in their communities or donate to help the DAV offer free support services to more than a million veterans across the U.S. each year.
•Sinclair Cares: Summer Hunger Relief - a partnership with Feeding America® to help provide meals to children and families across the U.S. through financial contributions, donors helped provide more than two million meals to children and families in their local communities, with funds going directly to the Feeding America food bank in the donor’s local community. The Company provided a $25,000 donation.
Our stations also sponsor countless philanthropic campaigns and events such as health expos, parades, and blood drives in their local markets and contribute to local charities. We encourage not only our stations, but also our employees to engage in the communities in which we serve and live. Through our continued partnership with the Salvation Army and over 300 local partner organizations in the communities in which we operate, and with the support of our local TV stations and digital properties, we helped to raise over $12 million in 2022 for non-profit organizations, schools, agencies, and local disaster relief; collected more than 330,000 pounds of food; provided close to 4.5 million meals; and collected toys, school supplies, diapers, hygiene products, and units of blood for those in need. In addition, we donated more than 5,700 hours of airtime.
Our Diversity Scholarship Fund provides support to college students demonstrating a promising future in the broadcast industry. In 2022, we expanded our scholarship program nationally and selected 17 winning applicants for the scholarship. We have distributed more than $250,000 in tuition assistance since 2013, with a goal to invest in the future of the broadcast industry and to help students from diverse backgrounds, who reflect our audience nationwide, complete their education and pursue careers in broadcast journalism, digital storytelling, and marketing.
Environmental Responsibility
Our mission is to identify and implement ways to reduce our impact on the environment through the education and engagement of internal and external audiences around sustainable solutions that can be adopted. We have accelerated actions within our organization to lessen our use of electricity over time and to measure and eventually report on our electricity usage. Our sustainability group is tasked with finding ways to help lower our carbon footprint through lowering our electricity consumption, purchasing greener supplies, and recycling. One such initiative is the efforts we are undertaking in proactively replacing our existing less efficient lighting with LED lighting, replacing HVAC equipment with higher efficiency models, and exploring solar energy, battery farms, and electric vehicles as other ways our company can reduce its reliance on energy sources that result in emissions of greenhouse gasses that are harmful to the environment. Since 2017, we have installed 117 new, energy efficient television transmitters, which are typically 25% more energy efficient than the units that they replace and generate less waste heat, and are currently installing, or have plans to install, an additional 38 during 2023 and 2024. Throughout the organization, we are seeking to reduce the use of paper products and, whenever possible, recycling paper, electronics, and other items. We were one of only 19 organizations recognized by Office Depot in 2021 for being a leader in green purchasing, recognizing our high degree of expenditures with eco-friendly attributes such as recycled content, energy-efficiency, and reduced use of harsh chemicals. In April 2022, we launched a public service campaign, with Batteries Plus, to encourage our viewers to recycle their batteries by bringing them to Batteries Plus locations and later in the year, we launched a pilot program to recycle the Company’s batteries and to identify ways to reduce our overall battery consumption. The initiative arose from a Company innovation contest, where employees were surveyed on ways our organization could lessen its impact on the environment. By partnering with Batteries Plus for this initiative, we are working towards an eco-friendly process to be utilized for the recycling program and proper safety precautions that we plan to utilize at all of our locations 
 In addition to our direct efforts to reduce our impact on the environment, we produce high quality news to increase our viewers' general awareness of environmental issues and programs by providing them information on how they can participate in improving environmental sustainability.
Governance
Sinclair takes corporate governance and responsibilities to its stakeholders very seriously. We remain committed to finding the best representation to drive success in the organization in the years ahead. Diversity of thought, skills, background, and experience are important elements the Company looks for in its leadership team. In 2021, we hired a Chief Compliance Officer and made changes to our Board of Directors (the "Board") structure, including adding a regulatory committee and a nominating and corporate governance committee. Our Chief Compliance Officer provides regular updates to Company management and meets quarterly with the regulatory committee. In 2021, Laurie R. Beyer was added to the Board as a new independent director and our first female Board member and, in 2022, Dr. Benjamin S. Carson, Sr. was added to the Board as a new independent director and our first racially diverse Board member.
Managing and governing cybersecurity risk remains a high priority. We continue to make investments to ensure continuous improvement of our cybersecurity control effectiveness and governance. We maintain a data protection policy and have invested in additional cybersecurity solutions, professional services, and the growth of our information security department. We continue to work closely with our key partners and supporting agencies to mature our security posture and quickly adjust to today’s rapidly changing threat landscape. Our Chief Information Officer and Chief Information Security Officer report quarterly to the Board of Directors’ cybersecurity subcommittee to ensure that they receive regular updates from Company management regarding the status of current and future cybersecurity plans, enabling the subcommittee to provide oversight of those issues. We did not experience any material cybersecurity incidents during 2022. In 2022, we launched a comprehensive Enterprise Risk Management program that is designed to both identify risks across the Company and actions to mitigate those risks. We continue to execute our plans to strengthen our existing cybersecurity defenses and intend to make further investments in the upcoming year.
