ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 We are Transforming Cybersecurity Through Collective Defense(SP) using our behavioral analytics technology.
 We compete in the Network Detection and Response (“NDR”) category, which is a growing aspect of modern enterprise security, but which does include major competitors. Our value proposition and competitive differentiator is our IronNet Collective Defense platform ("Collective Defense"). Our founder and Co-CEO, Gen. Keith B. Alexander (Ret.), the longest serving Director of the National Security Agency (“NSA”) and Commander of Cyber Command in U.S. history, serves as a valuable business development resource for establishing relationships with larger enterprise and government buyers. The significant majority of our current revenue comes from our IronDome and IronDefense products. IronDefense is an NDR cybersecurity product that uses artificial intelligence (“AI”), machine learning (“ML”), behavioral analytics, and operational tradecraft expertise to quickly identify specific network behaviors or events indicative of malicious threats. Enriched by our cyber tradecraft knowledge, alerts produced by our company help analysts quickly contextualize and prioritize threats that pose the greatest risks. By doing this we are able to provide clients, across a variety of industries, nation-state-level defensive capabilities to reduce cyber risk.
 We are a metric-driven organization with a differentiated and potentially transformational approach to the cybersecurity problem facing every organization today. With an ever-increasing cybersecurity threat posed by advanced persistent threat (“APT”) actors, our team of experts has developed a solution that automates and scales knowledge about how APTs operate and their tactics, techniques and procedures, in order to defeat them; few individuals and even fewer companies have that knowledge or capability. Our differentiated market offering called IronDome offers users a collective defense model to help mitigate threats posed by an APT enhanced by its IronDefense platform, offering our clients new protections against an APT with its technology.
 Cyber-security has advanced from a niche technical concern to a mainstream consideration for organizations of all sizes and in all sectors. Security protection concerns are most intense where safety or life-critical consequences might arise in response to a cyber threat. Power companies, financial services firms, telecommunications companies, military organizations, and government agencies thus have the greatest need for security protection, and now make considerable investments in cybersecurity.
 The primary security challenge in modern organizations is the complexity that has evolved in the typical business or government entity. Applications, networks, systems, endpoints, and data have experienced considerable sprawl as the costs associated with computing have decreased significantly. This is especially true for cloud-based infrastructure and SaaS-based applications, where cheap ubiquitous services are now available on-demand and for nearly every purpose imaginable.
 Modern organizations must therefore develop security protections that address such growth, often delivered in the context of digital transformation initiatives. An additional complication is that hackers have been augmented by determined, capable adversaries, often funded or otherwise backed by criminal groups or nation-states. Serious consideration must thus be given to the types of protections that are necessary to defend against the threat from such capable threat actors.


An additional dimension is that the velocity associated with computing infrastructure and their associated threats has accelerated. Agile DevOps processes generate new features at increasing rates, sometimes hourly for popular services, and hackers use automated platforms to bombard targeted infrastructure with alarming intensity. Security engineers thus require controls that are automated and that address this challenge of increased speed. Manually controlled point solutions no longer stop threats.
 A further complication is the massive and increasing scale associated with the types of systems operated by larger enterprise teams. Large-scale IT and network systems remove the ability for organizations to rely on manual maintenance, fixed configurations, and simple asset management. Furthermore, the visibility of assets that might be well-known by smaller organizations can only be approximated in large-scale settings. This greatly complicates the challenge of delivering security in a large-scale setting.
 In response to these challenges, modern Chief Information Security Officers (“CISOs”) put considerable time and effort into designing and implementing a workable security architecture. Individual CISO-led teams—even if they focus their efforts – have come to recognize that they cannot address the cybersecurity challenge on their own. It is well-understood in the cybersecurity community that enterprise security teams need considerable external assistance, coordination and cooperative guidance.
 Some of this assistance is obvious: Businesses rarely develop their own security tools, but rather buy from vendors or adjust open-source tools. Similarly, information sharing groups have emerged to support cooperative discussions between experts. It is therefore not controversial to suggest that businesses and agencies need to work together to address cybersecurity threats. The big question, instead, is how this objective can be best achieved. This is one of the challenges addressed by IronNet.
 Background of IronNet
 We are a global cybersecurity company revolutionizing how organizations secure their networks by delivering the first-ever Collective Defense platform operating at scale. Employing a number of former NSA cybersecurity operators with offensive and defensive cyber experience, we integrate deep tradecraft knowledge into our industry-leading products to solve the most challenging cyber problems facing the world today. Gen. Alexander founded our company in 2014 to solve the major cybersecurity problem he witnessed and defined during his tenure as former head of the NSA and founding Commander of U.S. Cyber Command: You can’t defend against threats you can’t see. Our innovative approach provides the ability for groups of organizations—within an industry sector, supply chain, state or country, for example—to see, detect and defend against sophisticated cyber attacks earlier and faster than ever before.
 We have defined a new market category called Collective Defense. As the first mover in this category, we have developed our Collective Defense platform, the first, and to our knowledge, the only solution that can identify anomalous (potentially suspicious or malicious) behaviors on computer networks and share this intelligence anonymously and in real time among Collective Defense community members. Collective Defense communities comprise groups of organizations that have common risks, such as a supply chain, a business ecosystem, or across an industry sector, a state, or a country. This cybersecurity model delivers timely, actionable, and contextual alerts and threat intelligence on attacks targeting enterprise networks, and functions as an early-warning detection system for all community members.
 This new platform addresses a large and unwavering compound problem: limited threat visibility for increasingly borderless enterprises across sectors and at the national level, paired with ineffective threat knowledge sharing across companies and sectors and a “go it alone” approach to cybersecurity. These operational gaps, combined with market dynamics like the increased velocity of sophisticated cyber attacks and the deepening scarcity of qualified human capital, have set our mission to transform how cybersecurity is waged.
 Understanding Collective Cyber Defense
 Ideally the U.S. Government could defend the nation against cyberattacks similar to what was developed for the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (“ICBM”) missile threat. Unfortunately, the ability to enact such a defense would likely require limiting personal freedoms on the internet that Americans currently enjoy. Legislation limiting personal freedoms would likely be challenging to pass and thus the probability of that happening in the near future is low. A 2020 Cyberspace Solarium Commission report contains over 80 recommendations to address the issue of cybersecurity, with one of them being “Reshaping the Cyber Ecosystem.” That report states:
 “Raising the baseline level of security across the cyber ecosystem—the people, processes, data, and technology that constitute and depend on cyberspace —will constrain and limit adversaries’ activities. Over time this will reduce the frequency, scope, and scale of their cyber operations. Because the vast majority of this ecosystem is owned and operated by the private sector, scaling up security means partnering with the private sector and adjusting incentives to produce positive outcomes.”
 Our collective defense model, IronDome, is a means for the private sector to “raise the baseline” level of security by partnering amongst themselves to “produce positive outcomes.” This overwatch function is a differentiator for our portfolio of offerings, making us one of the few companies that has the ways, ends and means to enact this transformational concept due to the technical capabilities required to ensure its success.
 To understand our platform and solution approach, it is best to begin with an outline of how collective defense can reduce cybersecurity risk for larger organizations. This approach benefits from many years of organizations beginning to share data through various groups such as Information Sharing and Analysis Organizations (“ISAO”). We are the first major commercial vendor to offer an end-to-end means to take full advantage of the collective concept.
 Toward a Collective Cyber Defense
 Businesses and agencies will only cooperate on collective cybersecurity initiatives if they see meaningful benefits with low associated risk. Admittedly, this is how almost all business decisions are made, but large-scale cybersecurity introduces an added benefit for collective defense—namely, that cyber protection schemes work much better when they involve a wider range of intelligence, visibility, and security coverage. Working together on cybersecurity thus introduces clear benefits for participants.
 Nevertheless, cooperation between businesses, agencies, and other groups must address two ends of the spectrum: upside benefits and downside risks for each of the entities and groups involved. In both instances, the case can be made that, for large-scale infrastructure, both benefits and risks can cascade, perhaps even accelerating as lateral traversal of an attack occurs. That is, threats to someone else’s system, however remote, might cascade across networks and systems.
 Within a large organization, collective protection across business units can have comparable benefit, particularly in companies that evolved through mergers and acquisitions, where a collective defense can help to bring together disparate data sources, defensive perspectives, and protection platforms into a common defense. Such intra-enablement within a large organization is a major focus area for IronNet.
 The primary benefits of a collective defense for large-scale cyber defense, whether stretched across a sector, combined between multiple organizations, or combined across the business units of one company, include the following:
 Early Warning System—An organization can develop a more effective early warning system if other groups share their indicators in real-time. Not engaging in such sharing limits the ability of a local team to capitalize on early warning that a cascading attack might be underway.
 Broader Visibility—By working together with other groups, the local security team benefits from broader visibility, including an improved understanding of how local enterprise changes (e.g., Domain Name System ("DNS")-related) might cascade to other targets.
 Strength in Numbers—The fact that cooperation increases visibility into a cyber threat means that organizations who cooperate with external groups are able to leverage strength-in-numbers and thereby provide better security support.


The corresponding risks that must be managed in the development of any large-scale cooperative arrangement for cybersecurity include the following:
 Privacy of Shared Data—The possibility emerges that sharing information with a cooperative might result in leaked data or a serious privacy incident. For highly regulated industries, sharing with governments may also expose businesses to some regulatory risk (although this is partially mitigated by certain provisions of the Cybersecurity Information Security Act of 2014) if the data is not properly anonymized or otherwise does not comply with legal requirements. Controls must be in place to ensure that cooperating teams are not exposed to this risk.
 Attribution of Incidents—Public attribution of an embarrassing or problematic cybersecurity incident to a sharing entity may reduce (or even remove) the willingness of that organization (and others) to share further information about something that might reflect poorly on their own actions. This is less an issue for collective defenses implemented across the business units of one organization.
 Competitive Relationship—The risk of one company directly assisting its competitor through participation in a collective defense scheme (e.g., AT&T assisting Verizon, or General Motors assisting Toyota) cannot be ignored. The legal and marketing teams from participating organizations would be wise to adopt the airline and energy industry’s observations that a mutual focus on safety helps every participant.
 The benefits and risks of cooperation for large-scale cybersecurity across heterogenous groups must be carefully balanced in setting up a collective defense. Too often, collectives are developed that leave participants wondering what’s in it for them, and how potential problems might be avoided. One of our main value propositions is that cooperative cybersecurity will work best when such concerns are carefully curated by a trusted provider with a world-class platform.
 Role of Government in Collective Defense
 One challenge federal governments have in supporting collective cyber defense is that most large businesses are multi-national. This suggests that while national allegiance might be easily identified (e.g., Verizon is American, Huawei is Chinese), such allegiance must address the interests of the company’s shareholders. This emphasis is often misunderstood by government agencies who are focused exclusively on national interests.
 Federal governments also have the additional role of regulating and sometimes punishing organizations not meeting their security requirements. This obligation complicates government cooperation with business on cybersecurity, at least to the extent that governments are permitted to regulate based on voluntarily shared information. Organizations would thus be hesitant to share information with a cooperative involving government if the reported incident might lead to regulatory investigation.
 The biggest challenge, however, is that the majority of critical infrastructure is owned and operated by the private sector. This implies that security telemetry, indicators, and early warnings will come from the private sector, even for many military applications and defensive government activities. This fact is often not understood by citizens and politicians who may demand that government step in and fix large-scale cybersecurity threats. This is usually just not practically feasible.
 Government must work hard to share the information it uniquely controls, such as classified indicators that might be downgraded for sharing externally or be shared in a more limited context to defend critical infrastructure. Businesses must also recognize that their obligations extend beyond just the shareholder. This recognition that cooperative sharing is in the best interests of the organization and society in general is an important driver behind our platform offering.
 Overview of our Platform Offering
 The Collective Defense platform comprises two flagship products:
 IronDefense is an advanced NDR solution that uses AI-driven behavioral analytics to detect and prioritize anomalous activity inside individual enterprises. We leverage advanced Artificial Intelligence/Machine-Learning (“AI/ML”) algorithms to detect previously unknown threats that have not been identified and “fingerprinted” by industry researchers, in addition to screening any known threats, and apply our Expert System to prioritize the severity of the behaviors—all at machine speed and cloud scale.
 IronDome is a threat-sharing solution that facilitates a crowdsource-like environment in which the IronDefense threat detections from an individual company are shared among members of a Collective Defense community, consisting of our customers who have elected to permit their information to be anonymously shared and cross-correlated by our IronDome systems. IronDome analyzes threat detections across the community to identify broad attack patterns and provides anonymized intelligence back to all community members in real time, giving all members early insight into potential incoming attacks. Automated sharing across the Collective Defense community enables faster detection of attacks at earlier stages.
 Our Collective Defense platform is designed to deliver strong network effects. Every customer contributing its threat data (anonymously) into the community is able to reap benefits from the shared intelligence of the other organizations. The collaborative aspect of Collective Defense, and the resulting prioritization of alerts based on their potential severity, helps address the known problem of “alert fatigue” that plagues overwhelmed security analysts.
 Our Collective Defense platform is largely cloud-deployed (public or private), though it is also available in on-premise and hybrid environments, and is scalable to include small-to-medium businesses and public-sector agencies as well as multinational corporations. We provide professional cybersecurity services such as incident response and threat hunting, as well as programs to help customers assess cybersecurity governance, maturity, and readiness. Our Customer Success ("CS") services are designed to create shared long-term success measures with our customers, differentiating us from other cybersecurity vendors by working alongside customers as partners and offering consultative and service capabilities beyond implementation.
 Our Collective Defense platform is a subscription-based pricing and flexible delivery model, with 63% of our revenue for the year ended January 31, 2022 related to deployments involving our key public cloud providers Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. We also support private cloud, or Hyper Converged Infrastructure (“HCI”) such as Nutanix as well as on-premise environments through hardware and virtual options. To make it as easy as possible for customers to add Collective Defense into their existing security stack, we built a rich set of Application Programming Interfaces (“APIs”) that enable integrations with standard security products, including security information and event management (“SIEM”); security orchestration, automation, and response (“SOAR”); endpoint detection and response (“EDR”); next-generation firewall (“NGFW”) tools; and cloud-native logs from the major public cloud providers.
 We describe our go-to-market strategy as “land and expand with network effects.” Our approach is to initially secure influential “cornerstone” customers and then expand into their respective Collective Defense communities with additional “community members” from organizations of similar industry sector, state, country, supply chain, or tailored business ecosystem. As each Collective Defense community grows, so does the volume of shared data, and the value of our platform for each of those members thereby expands both technically and commercially.
 We sell into both public and private organizations and the business ecosystems that support them. We have identified tens of thousands of prospective cornerstone customers and more than 100,000 potential community customers.
 Some of the world’s largest enterprises, government organizations, high-profile brands, and governments trust us to protect their networks. Our customers include a top global hedge fund, eight of the top 10 U.S. energy companies (based on revenue), a leading Asian mobile phone carrier, two U.S. Department of Defense (“DoD”) branches, a mid-sized bank in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) region, four U.S. state agencies, U.K. and Singapore government entities, and a large global holding company. Most recently, we have grown a Collective Defense community for the space industrial base. This community includes five commercial space companies, including Intuitive Machines, Axiom Space, Satelles, and X-Energy.
 We began targeting large enterprises and Fortune 500 companies, but the flexibility and scalability of our cloud-native platform and enhance go-to-market approach enabled us to expand our customer base to smaller companies as well. We have been recognized in the cybersecurity industry by independent third-party analysts, including Gartner, Forrester, IDC, 451 Research Group, and Omdia, who called our analytics a “potential game changer” in a June 2020 report. In August 2020, we announced that we had achieved “FedRAMP-ready” for Agency Authorization status, as approved by the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program

(“FedRAMP”). In January 2021, the global insurance brokerage Marsh named the Collective Defense platform as one of its industry- recognized Cyber Catalyst solutions. In February 2022, we earned from SE Labs Ltd. a AAA rating for Enterprise Advanced Security NDR Detection.
Industry Background
 Cybersecurity trends
 There are a number of key trends driving the need for a new approach to cybersecurity.
 Increased velocity of sophisticated attacks
 Increasingly, adversaries are well-trained, possess significant technological and human resources, and are highly deliberate and targeted in their attacks. Adversaries today range from militaries and intelligence services of well-funded nation-states, to sophisticated criminal organizations motivated by financial gains, to hackers leveraging readily available advanced techniques. The broad availability and rapid evolution of cyber attack toolkits and use of regional cloud infrastructure or compromised servers to launch attacks make it nearly impossible for security teams to keep up with cyber threats. Given sufficient amount of time and resources, a determined adversary will have the ability to breach current cyber defenses of almost any enterprise, organization, or government.
 Rear-facing and insufficient tools
 Gartner, an industry research firm, estimates that worldwide spending on global information security will be $186.2 billion by 2024, up from $124.2 billion in 2018. Even with increased cybersecurity spending, however, security outcomes have not substantially improved. The recent widespread SolarWinds/SUNBURST cyberattack is just one example of how a sophisticated adversary can thoroughly permeate an industry, geography or supply chain. The lack of equally sophisticated threat intelligence sharing allowed this hack to penetrate networks more deeply, and for much longer. The evolving threat landscape has rendered traditional defense approaches incapable of protecting organizations against next-generation threats.
 The current generation of security products focuses on signature-based approaches that often have limited ability to collect, process, and analyze vast amounts of data—attributes that are required to be effective in today’s increasingly dynamic threat landscape. This includes traditional and next-generation firewalls, Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (“IDPS”), SIEMs, and other similar tools that are designed to manage policies for network traffic and rely on rear-facing threat intelligence indicators of compromise (“IoCs”) based on IP, domains, file hashes and other signature-based intelligence from known threats. They are not fundamentally designed to detect advanced, never-before-seen, “unknown unknown” cyber threats in a timely and scalable fashion.
 The borderless enterprise where the network is no longer the perimeter
 Cloud, IoT and SaaS applications have expanded the attack surface and cyber vulnerabilities. [According to Gartner] in 2022, 31% of all workers worldwide are remote (a mix of hybrid and fully remote), including 53% of the U.S. workforce. The reality of the borderless enterprise will fundamentally change network cyber defenses from a centralized command and control defensive strategy using traditional on-premise blocking infrastructure to a distributed detect and respond strategy that fuses different sources of telemetry data across network, endpoints, and logs into actionable intelligence using large-scale behavioral analysis for security teams to take action.
Scarcity of qualified human capital
 Even with the most sophisticated AI-based cyber technology in place, the human element of cybersecurity investigation, triage, and research plays an important role in risk reduction. As our Collective Defense platform is detecting and prioritizing anomalies, the analysts and threat hunters are ultimately deciding which alerts to triage, investigate, and manage through to response and mitigation. Organizations are consistently under-resourced in this area, however, as the ratio of the volume of network traffic versus the number of cybersecurity specialists to analyze that traffic is severely lopsided, resulting in Security Operations Center (“SOC”) staff overwhelm and burnout. The 2021 (ISC)² Cybersecurity Workforce Study, which provides two critical measures of the cybersecurity profession—the Cybersecurity Workforce Estimate and the Cybersecurity Workforce Gap, suggests that the global cybersecurity workforce needs to grow 65% to effectively defend organizations’ critical assets. Despite estimates that there are 4.19 million cybersecurity professionals worldwide, the Cybersecurity Workforce Gap persists due to the accelerated evolution of the threat landscape and its impact on organizations’ security practices.
 Cloud impact on enterprise cyber defenses
 As digital transformation has accelerated in all industries, traditional security controls implemented on companies' on-premise networks are often no longer available and often must operate differently for the outsourcing of IT infrastructure and operations to the public cloud provider. While the cloud is designed to make business easier, Management and Security Operations are different from traditional on-premise security, as the teams do not have access to the underlying networks or logs, and therefore have limited visibility of cloud infrastructure. The major cloud providers have introduced logging and basic detection using signature-based detection strategies, but these require additional third-party or custom capabilities to provide sufficient defenses. Security vendors have attempted to fill the security gaps by introducing new products for the cloud based on existing on-premise technologies, but these are often cloud bolt-ons that provide limited detection and visibility for cloud environments and are complex to deploy, difficult to scale, brittle to maintain, and costly to own.
 Limitations of existing products
 Existing detection and threat sharing methods have a number of limitations, including:
 Legacy signature-based products
 Signature-based products are designed to detect known attacks using a repository of previously identified indicators of compromise, but are not capable of detecting or responding to unknown threats. Used by network security, endpoint security, SIEMs and other standard defense-in-depth cybersecurity solutions as a core detection method, these signature-based detections have resulted in many significant breaches due to the failure of legacy defenses to detect a previously unknown or modified version of a previously known attack. While current technologies remain essential, they miss a large swath of dangerous threats that evade detection, as evidenced by the major SolarWinds/SUNBURST supply chain and Microsoft Exchange server attacks widely reported in the news media in 2020 and 2021.
 Log and event management products
 SIEMs and similar log management products are designed for compliance, reporting, and security incident management purposes, but they struggle with the scale and processing required to deliver the behavioral-analysis capabilities across current and historical data to detect new or modified versions of known threats. While these systems provide useful correlation capabilities, security operation teams are increasingly leveraging these systems for central aggregation points for workflow, ticketing, and case management, rather than for detection.
 First generation network-based behavioral analysis products
 First generation network-based behavioral analysis products provide a basic level of outlier detection using Bayesian analysis or other statistical methods to identify obvious patterns in small networks. Often marketed as AI solutions, these solutions lack the scale, correlation, or analysis capabilities needed to detect threats hiding in plain sight within networks commonly seen at mid-sized or larger enterprises with thousands of devices, hundreds of applications, multiple physical sites, and multi-cloud architectures.
 Infrastructure monitoring/network performance monitoring and diagnostic-based products
 Traditional network infrastructure providers offer infrastructure monitoring products designed to identify network bottlenecks and other network reliability or performance issues. Increasingly, these vendors have added bolt-on cybersecurity capabilities that can provide security teams’ networks with asset discovery and

some network visibility, but they struggle with the algorithmic analysis needed to detect new and unknown threats with high fidelity or the forensic capabilities required by security operations team to investigate, triage, and respond to an identified network anomaly.
 Threat intelligence sharing products
 Threat intelligence products are designed to share massive amounts of non-specific signature-based IoCs that commonly focus on IP addresses and domains of known threats and often only after a substantial period of time by the contributing organization. The lack of timeliness or specificity to an enterprise severely limits the effectiveness of the shared information from a cyber defense perspective. By the time this information is shared, usually weeks or months after an attack, a sophisticated attacker only needs to slightly modify their methods by changing their attack infrastructure to enable them to bypass cyber defenses of their targeted enterprises, industries, or nations.
 Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (“ISACs”) and other threat sharing groups
 Threat sharing groups emerged more than 20 years ago as a way for security teams to work together to collect, analyze, and share actionable threat information within their member communities. We believe this is a substantial step in the right direction; however, threat sharing in these groups relies largely on signature-centric threat intelligence platforms that struggle with timeliness and specificity of their intelligence or ad hoc manual forms of communication, such as email and only with a subset of security defenders with whom an analyst has a personal relationship. ISACs and similar groups are the right organizations, but they need technological solutions that enable them to share contextual, relevant, and timely information in real time across the full community.
 Creating a new market segment: Collective Defense
 We are creating a new market category with Collective Defense. With our Collective Defense platform, we developed the first and, to our knowledge, the only solution that can identify and rate anomalous behaviors on the network and share this anonymized threat intelligence among Collective Defense community members (who may comprise a supply chain, state, or country) as an early-warning system for all.
 The power of Collective Defense is that multiple companies can essentially work as a team to detect and defend against attackers early in the network threat intrusion cycle. This differentiated approach allows customers to:
 Gain real-time visibility across the threat landscape
 Our Collective Defense platform leverages proven behavioral analytics, ML, and AI techniques across anonymized participant data to identify stealthy, sophisticated threats that otherwise may be missed by an individual enterprise and signature-based tools. The platform has been designed to deliver real-time visibility of cyber threats targeting supply chains, industries, regions, or any custom IronDome Collective Defense grouping.
 Reduce impact of cyber attacks with help from fellow cyber defenders
 Our Collective Defense ecosystem acts as a collaboration hub to enable participants to automatically share real-time detections, triage outcomes, threat indicators, and other insights with members of their Collective Defense group. When suspicious behaviors are identified by any member, IronDome automatically shares a proactive warning to all members at machine speed so each member can prioritize their defense against the identified cyber threat.
 Improve effectiveness of existing cybersecurity investments
 Threat intelligence is valuable, actionable, and relevant only when received in time, before a threat enters a network. Our innovative collective threat intelligence provides immediate alerts at machine speed and context into urgent threats, enabling organizations to prioritize threats and build a proactive defense. This information can be used by a customer’s existing network, endpoint, or other security tools to identify and stop adversaries from retargeting their attack.
 The following diagram depicts several differences between legacy approaches and our new approach:
 


Our Solution: The Collective Defense Platform
 Our Collective Defense platform comprises two tightly integrated proprietary technologies: Our NDR solution, IronDefense, and our innovative collective threat-sharing solution, IronDome.
 Our Collective Defense platform offers a unified set of technologies that powers a wide range of network behavioral detection, security operations, real- time threat landscape visibility, threat sharing, and peer SOC-analyst collaboration capabilities. We can rapidly and cost effectively deploy in our customer’s environments, 63% of which by revenue were in the public cloud as of January 31, 2022, but we also support private cloud and on-premise infrastructure. Our

expanding set of open APIs and ecosystem integrations enable us to add new sources of data for behavioral analysis and Collective Defense sharing and collaboration to detect and stop targeted cyber attacks.
 Armed with elite detection capabilities and combined offensive operator experience at the highest level of the U.S. government, our founders set out to build a behavioral analytics solution to detect threats heading toward, or already in, the network. A growing portfolio of proprietary analytics forms the backbone of IronDefense.
 However, while effective in detecting unknown anomalies, behavioral analytics by itself is insufficient in modern, noisy networks where anomalies are common and can lead to a high number of false positives. For many NDR vendors in the industry, the solution is to tune their analytics to be less sensitive in order to deliver reduced false-positive rates at the expense of letting true positives into the network. We undertook a different strategy to meet this challenge. We introduced our expert system scoring algorithms, supported by our elite cyber hunters, to increase IronDefense's detection specificity while preserving the sensitivity of its analytics.
 Powered by IronDefense’s threat detections, IronDome, which we introduced in 2018, is the foundation of our Collective Defense platform, a purpose-built, cloud-native, and holistic platform that is capable of defending, analyzing, and correlating threats from various sources. It delivers timely, actionable, and contextual insights to attacks targeting an enterprise and, from there, is able to provide early warning to all members of the Collective Defense ecosystem.
 The differentiated value of our Collective Defense platform is its ability to build a dynamic, comprehensive picture of the threat environment, much like radar for cyberspace, based on real-time, anonymized alert correlation across any participating member environments. It also provides situational context and peer insights for greater visibility and context of the threat landscape at any given time.
 Correlated alerts for threat detection earlier in the intrusion cycle
 We are not aware of any other vendor in the market with a similar approach to cybersecurity. Even though community members bring disparate network environments, such as cloud, on-premise or hybrid, to the Collective Defense ecosystem, correlated threats stand out given that the adversarial behaviors are typically consistent, no matter who the target is, as was the case with the SolarWinds/SUNBURST attack.
 Our Collective Defense platform comprises two flagship products:
 IronDefense
 IronDefense is an advanced NDR solution that provides behavior-based and AI-driven analytics at the network level to detect anomalous activity at individual enterprises and prioritize the highest threats in a company’s network. We leverage novel AI/ML algorithms to deliver high-fidelity analytics required to detect previously unknown threats. In addition, we provide advanced enrichment techniques via IronDefense’s Expert System, which has been designed to achieve high efficacy levels, low false positive rates, and improved visibility compared to legacy approaches. This is all done at network speed and cloud scale.
 Most current cybersecurity tools focus on detecting the final “action-on-target” step of an intrusion. At this stage, identification is easier but the insights come far too late to stop attackers from getting into positions in the network to exfiltrate data, steal IP, or accomplish other malicious objectives. IronDefense uses advanced analytics based on metadata from the traffic in the customer’s network to identify anomalous activity earlier in the intrusion kill chain.
 Key components of IronDefense include:
 IronDefense behavioral analysis engine
 IronDefense leverages behavior-based and correlation-based detections to identify threats targeting industries and companies earlier in the intrusion cycle, and to identify the underlying behavior and methods to counter unknown threats, or customizations that attackers will implement to target companies in the future. Our behavioral analytics are built upon algorithms that form the foundation of our patented IronDefense platform. They are computationally designed to understand normal network behavior by applying tests to create a benchmark of standard, acceptable traffic patterns in the network. Detected anomalies are grouped with similar instances of traffic behavior to minimize alerting and to aggregate events within the customers’ networks. IronDefense enhancements in March 2022 include the ability to detect malicious payloads, allowing for better protection of managed and unmanaged devices from malware, ransomware, and APTs.
 IronDefense Expert System
 IronDefense includes an Expert System that automates security operations playbooks of how top cyber operations hunters leverage contextual data and other sources of telemetry data later on in the detection and response process and applies it to the risk scoring of anomalies detected by its behavioral analysis. This enables us to preservice IronDefense's detection accuracy without sacrificing the sensitivity of its algorithms by leveraging the wisdom of our elite cyber hunters triaging thousands of alerts from real-world environments. Our Expert System also alleviates the “alert fatigue” that plagues every SOC by minimizing the tedious steps in an investigation, reducing alert fatigue and allowing security teams to focus on responding to high risk detection in their environments. The Expert System is continually optimized through machine learning from anonymized triaged outcomes by our cyber hunters using IronDefense.
 IronDefense correlation threat engine
 Threat analysts and hunters spend a significant portion of their time triaging individual alerts by identifying corroborating evidence and related information. In March 2022, we launched a new threat correlation engine for the automated correlation of detections and alerts. The threat engine models adversary attack techniques and pre-correlates anomalous activity by threat categories to improve risk scoring and alert prioritization, as well as to dramatically reduce alert load. This system leverages a multi-pass system that first optimizes for detecting as many potential instances of a particular type of threat activity and enriching detections with threat intelligence and other external and internal data sources to optimize for detection precision. Events are further aggregated by entity information, attack stage identification, and time sequence data to deliver a timeline of an attack and scored by risk to the enterprise.
 IronDefense threat hunting interface
 IronDefense includes a threat hunting interface built by our elite cyber hunters to empower security operations teams to conduct detailed investigative workflows and forensic analysis of threats detected by IronDefense. The hunting interface empowers security analysts to investigate across all raw traffic, network metadata, logs, telemetry data, and collective threat intelligence captured by IronDefense, all the way down to full-packet capture of individual network flows. In March 2022, we enhanced the platform’s hunt panel for extended hunt capabilities, expanding the investigation window to 30, 60, and 90 days (per individual customer service level agreement) over metadata and the associated packet capture ("PCAP") data. This capability offers IronNet customers a fully integrated hunt platform designed for easy pivoting from an isolated alert down to the metadata and full PCAP associated with that alert, providing more time to respond and triage based on longer-term historical analysis and historical context.
IronDefense sensors
 IronDefense sensors are cloud, virtual, and physical sensors that are deployed at the network perimeter to ingest “north-south” traffic within internal networks to provide “east-west” traffic visibility across an enterprise. Cloud sensors are available for public cloud environments to ingest raw traffic data directly from Infrastructure-as-a-Service virtual networks from major cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) and Microsoft Azure deployments. The sensor extracts rich network session metadata from the raw traffic and sends it to our behavior analysis engine for processing and expert system validation. The IronDefense sensors also continuously collect full raw traffic packet capture for inspection during hunting operations.
 IronDefense direct data ingest


IronDefense has the ability to utilize a wide-range of data types and telemetry data directly from existing sources. These data sources include standard protocols such as DNS, HTTP/S, or Active Directory; common network log formats such as BRO/ZEEK or NetFlow; Cloud Provider logs such as AWS VPC, AWS CloudTrail or Microsoft Azure NSG logs; and application logs such as Office 365.
 IronDome
 IronDome is a threat-exchange solution that facilitates a crowdsourced-like environment in which the IronDefense findings from an individual company are automatically and anonymously exchanged within groups of related entities, such as portfolio companies, supply chains, industries, or nations, for correlation and further analysis. IronDome analyzes threat detections across companies to identify broad attack patterns and provides anonymized intelligence back to all customers in real time, serving as an early warning system for all.
 IronDome enables Collective Defense member enterprises to actively exchange individual anonymized cyber anomalies at machine speed across a community of public-private peers. This capability allows companies to identify stealthy attackers earlier in the attack cycle when many of their methods fall below the threshold of detection at a single company by allowing companies to aggregate data and run higher-order analysis across industry data.
 Key components of IronDome include:
 IronDome Collective Defense communities
 IronDome threat exchange is organized by communities of enterprises based on their business ecosystem, industry, region, or nation. Enterprises can be members of multiple communities based on their sharing preference and threat sharing needs. As customer adoption grows, the network effect of each additional enterprise participating in IronNet’s Collective Defense platform will amplify the breadth and depth of its dataset and intelligence.
 IronDome collective threat intelligence exchange
 IronDome links together communities of enterprises to provide contextual insights into the threat landscape. Machine and human intelligence is shared in real time across the community by threat correlations, as well as outcomes and insights related to how various analysts at different enterprises rated and triaged similar threats in their environment. Real-time feedback of these insights delivers enhanced threat landscape visibility and detection insights that allow members to immediately react to active threats targeting their industry and to adjust their defenses to combat the threat.
 IronDome Cyber Radar View
 IronDome creates a radar-like view of cyberspace that links private and public sector stakeholders in their Collective Defense community. The dashboard provides an anonymized real-time view of threats targeting an enterprise’s business ecosystem, supply chain, industry, or region.
Called Collective Defense communities, spearheaded by a “cornerstone” company or organization, an IronDome could be established for a company’s business ecosystem, such as a wealth management firm with many portfolio companies; a sector-based collaborative, such as in within energy or finance), or a cross-sector formation; states and countries; and private-public sector configurations.
 In each Collective Defense community, members agree to share anonymized data about threats detected on their individual networks with the collective, on an ongoing basis. This collaborative approach is designed to “flip the script” on attackers by raising the defensive capabilities of any one player. If correlated alerts and attribution based on behaviors suggest that a nation-state is involved, Collective Defense participants can voluntarily share threat information with the government for cyber defense on a national scale as needed to defend the nation.
 The Collective Defense platform is primarily deployed in cloud environments, but is also available for private cloud, on-premise, and hybrid environments, and it is scalable to include small- medium businesses as well as multinational corporations.
 Threat Intelligence
 Using information derived from the Collective Defense Platform, we also provide our customers with threat intelligence.
 IronNet Threat Intelligence Rules
 We augment third-party signature based detection rules with threat intelligence rules (“TIRs”) based on significant community findings. These detection rules for network, endpoint, or other security tools allow customers to proactively protect themselves against known threats through more secure controls.
IronNet Threat Intelligence Brief
 The monthly IronNet Threat Intelligence Brief provides top observed threats across our Collective Defense communities. It includes significant community findings, such as network behavioral anomalies that were rated as suspicious or malicious by us and/or participant analysts, threat intelligence rules, a snapshot of monthly correlated alerts, and threat research highlights.
Key Benefits of Our Solution
 Our solution offers our customers several benefits, including:
 •differentiated business value that includes behavioral analytics, which find threats that other tools cannot;
 •real-time threat-sharing across communities; and
 •value to the Collective Defense ecosystem through integrations.
 Behavioral analytics that find threats that other tools cannot detect
Superior threat behavior detection to see unknown threats
 IronDefense examines the network traffic itself, which is much harder for an attacker to evade or manipulate. IronDefense threat detections are based on advanced, high-fidelity analytics and AI/ML detection capabilities built by top cyber subject matter experts (“SMEs”), continuous PCAP, an expert system that applies the judgment and tradecraft playbooks of the nation’s top cyber defenders, and integrated cyber hunting (packet level visibility that improves speed and depth of investigations).
 Visibility across the full enterprise to close threat detection gaps
 IronDefense network detections fill the known void in threat visibility, which is being able to see unknown, novel threats on the network that other tools cannot see. The Collective Defense platform complements EDR and logs to provide comprehensive visibility across the threat landscape.
 Cognitive detection, correlation, and prioritization analytics for reduced false positives
 Our Collective Defense platform collects, processes, correlates, and analyzes high-fidelity data from customer networks (anonymized), threat intelligence on real-world attacks, significant community findings, and correlated alerts in the Collective Defense communities. We use this data to continually train and enhance our IronDefense behavioral analytics to increase the signal-to-noise ratio to detect new, unknown attacks with high-fidelity analytics. We automatically chain and score related events into signals to increase analyst visibility.
 Data ingest at scale for a broader view of the threat landscape


IronDefense gathers data streams from a variety of sources to build a more comprehensive picture of threats. Network sensors provide streaming capture of all network packets for detection and visibility into all protocols activity. Network logs provide asset discovery and device metadata for event enrichment and contextualization. Cloud data on user activity and usage patterns only the cloud provider can collect. Security ecosystem data provide entity and user operational state which supplements network and cloud data collected.
 The only real-time threat sharing capability across companies for stronger defense
The ability to defend better as a collective force
 Our Collective Defense platform orchestrates threat-sharing and collaboration in real time to deliver immediate visibility and instant sharing of malicious cyber threats targeting supply chains, industries, regions, or any custom Collective Defense community to reduce impact of cyber attacks with help from fellow cyber defenders. IronDome acts as a collaboration hub to enable members to automatically share real-time detections, triage outcomes, threat indicators, and other insights with members of their Collective Defense community.
 Faster warning and response capabilities
 When suspicious behaviors are identified by any member, IronDome automatically shares a proactive warning to all members at machine speed so each member can prioritize their defense against the identified cyber threat. This capability allows companies to identify stealthy attackers earlier in the attack cycle when many of their methods fall below the threshold of detection at a single company by allowing companies to aggregate data and run higher-order analyses across industry data. The platform supports opt-in anonymized sharing with governments for national response when necessary.
 Real-time sharing of peer insights for stronger defense
 Our Collective Defense platform allows community members to share threat context, prevalence, and expert commentary about how to triage and response, much like the Waze app for traffic, except for cybersecurity. By banding together and working together with peers, Collective Defense community members are better able to pool and optimize resources so they can achieve “defensive economies of scale” that allow them to keep up with and counteract cyber attackers.
 Deep subject matter expertise to improve customer defense
 We have an elite cyber operations team working directly with customers’ security teams to detect, triage, and respond. Our teams are led by cyber offensive and defensive SMEs. Approximately one-half of our cyber operations experts have NSA or U.S. Department of Defense experience, and 40% have cyber offensive, intel, or research experience.
 A force multiplier effect to help strained SOC teams
 Our deep SME knowledge enables a multiplier effect for severely strained SOC analysts, who can leverage insights from our security analysts and threat hunters, as well as peer insights and triage outcomes from the Collective Defense community. This approach addresses the cyber talent shortage, improving the effectiveness of SOC teams and optimizing tools and human resources. Our high-fidelity analytics and threat intelligence provide autonomous identification, prioritization, and recommendation to accelerate incident investigation and the response process.
 Added value to the cybersecurity ecosystem
 Easy-to-use deployment for faster time to value
 Our Collective Defense platform has been designed to be easy to provision, configure, and manage, working seamlessly with a suite of SIEM, SOAR, EDR, and NGFW APIs to streamline siloed security products. These integrations provide a natural complement to IronDefense and reinforce the users’ existing security infrastructures. Analysts do not need to re-learn anything and can see detections from a single view.
 Security for any environment
 We can provide security protection across cloud, multi-cloud, on-premise, and virtual environments to support customers with different needs, however 63% of deployments by revenue as of January 31, 2022 were in the public cloud. Our public cloud partners include AWS and Microsoft Azure. We have private cloud options based on Nutanix for customers that want to leverage their own on-premise HCI environments. The on-premise deployment option is our hardware appliance or virtual application.
 Improved effectiveness of existing security investments
 IronDefense automates many of the time-consuming threat discovery and investigation steps and indicates the severity of anomalous activity. Our customers’ analysts can make decisions in a shorter amount of time.

 Our Competition
 The market for our products and services is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid changes in technology, customer requirements, and by frequent new product and service offerings and improvements. We compete with a range of established and emerging security solution vendors. Conditions in our market could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements, partnerships, or acquisitions by competitors or continuing market consolidation

and we expect the competitive environment to remain intense.
 Our competitors include the following by general category:
 •first-generation NDR vendors such as DarkTrace or Vectra Networks, who offer point products based on Bayesian analysis, outlier analysis, and heuristic detection-based detection;
 •network security vendors, such as Cisco and Palo Alto Networks, Inc., who are supplementing their core network security additional behavioral-based detection with behavioral-based detection, threat intelligence and security operations solutions; and
 •legacy network infrastructure and performance monitoring companies such as ExtraHop and Arista Networks, who are adding security use cases to their infrastructure products.
 We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including but not limited to our ability to:
 •detect advanced network threats and to prevent security breaches;
 •anonymously correlate and share threats in real-time across a community of peer enterprises;
 •share human-intelligence across a Collective Defense community on how peer enterprises have rated and triaged similar detections; and
 •integrate with other participants in the security ecosystem.
 We also compete on our:
 •time to value, price, and total cost of ownership;
 •brand awareness, reputation, and trust in our services;
 •strength of sales, marketing, and channel partner relationships; and
 •customer success, cyber hunt, and cyber advisory services.
 Although some of our competitors enjoy greater resources, higher brand recognition, broader range of IT and security products, larger existing customer bases, or more mature intellectual property portfolios, we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors.
 Our Intellectual Property
 We believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business. We rely on trademarks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets, license agreements, intellectual property assignment agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, and employee non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Though we rely in part upon these legal and contractual protections, we believe that factors such as the skills and ingenuity of our employees and the functionality and frequent enhancements to our solutions are larger contributors to our success in the marketplace.
 As of April 12, 2022, we had three issued patents and seven pending applications in the United States covering our technology, as well as 37 issued international patents, six pending international patent applications, and five filed PCT applications. Our issued patents expire between 2035 and 2037.
 As of April 12, 2022, we had five registered brands in the United States, comprising four single-class trademark registrations and five single- and multiple-class service mark registrations. Four of those five brands are also registered internationally. In addition, we own pending multi-class, combined trademark/service mark applications in both the United States and abroad. We believe these registrations and pending applications offer robust protection for all of our brands. We intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost-effective.
 Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, they may not be respected in the future or may be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged. Our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We believe that competitors will try to develop products that are similar to our products and that may infringe our intellectual property rights. Our competitors or other third parties may also claim that our security platform and other solutions infringe their intellectual property rights. In particular, some companies in our industry may have extensive patent portfolios. From time to time, third parties may in the future assert claims of infringement, misappropriation and other violations of intellectual property rights against us or our customers, with whom our agreements may obligate us to indemnify against these claims. Successful claims of infringement by a third party could prevent us from offering certain products or features, require us to develop alternate, non-infringing technology, which could require significant time and during which we could be unable to continue to offer our affected products or solutions, require us to obtain a license, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all, or force us to pay substantial damages, royalties, or other fees.
 Government Regulation
 Our business activities are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws, rules, and regulations. Compliance with these laws, rules, and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations and competitive position as compared to prior periods. Nevertheless, compliance with existing or future governmental regulations, including, but not limited to, those pertaining to global trade, consumer and data protection, and taxes, could have a material impact on our business in subsequent periods. For more information on the potential impacts of government regulations affecting our business, see the section titled “Risk Factors” contained in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our Facilities
 Our corporate headquarters occupy approximately 12,000 square feet in Tysons, Virginia, part of the Washington, D.C. metropolitan region, under a lease that expires in June 2026. We also lease office space in Raleigh, North Carolina. We have a data center co-location facility in Reston, Virginia, and we also utilize AWS regional cloud services located around the world for our storage needs and to help deliver our solution. We believe that our existing facilities are sufficient for our current needs. In the future, we may need to add new facilities and expand our existing facilities as we add employees, grow our infrastructure and evolve our business, and we believe that suitable additional or substitute space will be available on commercially reasonable terms to meet our future needs.

We offer benefits including comprehensive health and welfare insurance, company match for health and wellness accounts, paid time-off and leaves, pet insurance, an Employee Assistance Program (to include counseling opportunities), legal advice, parental leave, discount programs to various travel vendors, and a retirement matching program. Our gym reimbursement program in the United States further helps to support employees’ physical well-being.
  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes in the best interest of employees as well as the communities in which we operate. This includes having the vast majority of our employees work from home, while implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work. We have also provided a work-from-home reimbursement program, as well as online classes and weekly newsletters to assist employees in that transition. To create a specific focus on the mental health and wellbeing of our employees, we created the “Unplug” program that provides several company- wide paid days off to help employees balance their work and life responsibilities. Additionally, to show a connection between IronNet and the employee, we also match their charitable contributions made to philanthropic organizations of their choice.
 Employees have the opportunity to join two other Ambassador groups whose intent, among other things, is to promote a culture of community and increase comradery. The groups include ‘Remote Worker’ whose focus is to join employees together through activities and support a family oriented philosophy; and ‘Philanthropy’ whose purpose is to connect employees through charitable programs and initiative.
 Growth and Development
 We actively foster a learning culture where employees are empowered to drive their career progression, supporting professional development and providing on-demand learning platforms. Employees enjoy three company paid learning platforms, and our education reimbursement program offers each eligible employee an allowance for long-term undergraduate and graduate studies, as well as short-term professional development where each department is awarded a budget for career training. Additionally, IronNet sponsors various leadership training opportunities through outside vendors as well as group technical training sessions.

Our internship program is available on an annual basis where college students are invited to participate in learning and mentorship opportunities with the hopes of full-time employment after graduation. Our development programs play a critical role in engaging and retaining our employees as these programs offer opportunities to continually enhance their skills for a variety of career opportunities across the company.
