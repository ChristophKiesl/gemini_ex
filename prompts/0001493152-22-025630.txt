The Company was formed as a Colorado corporation on July 21, 1988 as Beneficial Capital Financial Services Corp. On February 2, 1995, the Company changed its name to Golden Eagle International, Inc. (“GEII”). GEII had previously engaged in contract gold milling operations primarily in the state of Nevada in the United States.
 
On October 27, 2016, the Company acquired 100% stock ownership of Advantego Technologies, Inc., a California corporation formed on July 29, 2016, in exchange for 11,628,636 shares of the Company’s common stock. The stock exchange was deemed a reverse merger, as the management and operations of Advantego have continued, and Advantego’s management received in the aggregate a majority ownership in GEII as a result of the stock exchange.

We launched our field testing of various products and services beginning in May 2017 and commenced fulfillment of a revenue generating contract of our digital signage product to a network of certified auto care collision centers beginning in March of 2018 throughout the United States and continued through December 31, 2019. The digital signage product allowed the auto care collision centers to display, on a large television screen or counter displays, information concerning the center, their certifications and other informational and promotional content associated with the automotive industry. As of December 31, 2019, we had delivered approximately 1,250 controllers to the individual auto care collision centers. However, in 2019, our primary client, Assured Performance Network, decided not to purchase any additional digital signature products thus eliminating any recurring revenue the Company had expected to realize. Subsequently, Assured Performance was sold in its entirety eliminate any potential future business.
 
The Company also provided subscription-based online directory listing services and was a reseller of software that allowed potential customers to better locate an auto collision center on the internet. As of August 31, 2022, there were no auto care collision centers using the listing services or software.

During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company signed a Strategic Partnership and Manufacturing Agreement with manufacturer and exporter Shenzhen Ferex Electrical Co., Ltd of China (“Shenzhen”) to manufacture and supply electrical components and systems. The Company began offering design, engineering and manufacturing services to its customers in the beginning of 2019.
 
On May 26, 2019, the Company entered into an agreement with Aska Electronics Co., Ltd of China (“Aska”). Aska is a manufacturer of Bluetooth headphones, sport earbuds and associated listening devices and provides its products as an OEM and as an ODM for projects worldwide.
 
This approach continued throughout 2019 until it became apparent that, Aska and Shenzhen, among others, had limited capital capabilities and fell short of the potential of what management thought could be achieved with them. We learned that a catastrophe such as Covid 19 would devastate many small private and public companies because of their limited surplus capital. Since that time, no further strategic partnership agreements were sought by the Company because of the lack of financial capability in most of the potential associates. At no time was cash or a financeable purchase order offered by any of these associates. As of the date of this filing the Company has not generated any revenue related to the Shenzhen or Aska arrangements, and no consideration has been exchanged. The Company, therefore, has no obligations or contingent liabilities from its relationship with these entities moving forward. Any and all commitments that the Company had agreed to with Aska and Shenzhen have since been terminated or run their course.
 
As of August 31, 2022 we were not conducting any business.
