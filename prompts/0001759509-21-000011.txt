Our Mission
Improve people’s lives with the world’s best transportation.
Overview
Lyft, Inc (the “Company” or “Lyft”) started a movement to revolutionize transportation. In 2012, we launched our peer-to-peer marketplace for on-demand ridesharing and have continued to pioneer innovations aligned with our mission. Today, Lyft is one of the largest multimodal transportation networks in the United States and Canada. 
We believe that cities should be built for people, not cars. Mass car ownership in the twentieth century brought unprecedented freedom to individuals and spurred significant economic growth. However, in the process, city infrastructure became overwhelmingly devoted to cars. Roads and parking lots have replaced too much green space. Mass car ownership strains our cities and reduces the very freedom that cars once provided. Car ownership has also economically burdened consumers and can equate to a substantial portion of a household’s transportation spend despite the average car being parked and unused a majority of the time.
Consumers are seeking better ways to get around. They have grown accustomed to the convenience and immediacy of the on-demand economy and expect their experiences to be more simple, flexible and enjoyable. Existing transportation options have failed to meet this shift in consumer demand, creating the opportunity for a better solution.
We believe that the world is at the beginning of a shift away from car ownership to Transportation-as-a-Service (“TaaS”). Lyft is at the forefront of this massive societal change. Our ridesharing marketplace connects drivers with riders via the Lyft mobile application (the “App”) in cities across the United States and in select cities in Canada. We believe that our ridesharing marketplace allows riders to use their cars less and offers a viable alternative to car ownership while providing drivers using our platform the freedom and independence to choose when, where, how long and on what platforms they work. As this evolution continues, we believe there is a massive opportunity for us to improve the lives of riders by connecting them to more affordable and convenient transportation options.
We are laser-focused on revolutionizing transportation. We have established a scaled network of users brought together by our robust technology platform (the “Lyft Platform”) that powers rides and connections every day. We leverage our technology platform, the scale and density of our user network and insights from a significant number of rides to continuously improve our ridesharing marketplace efficiency and develop new offerings. For example, in May 2020, we expanded the availability of our Wait & Save mode on our ridesharing platform, which is an ideal offering for riders with more flexible schedules that want to leverage the savings we can offer by shifting demand to better meet supply. We’ve also taken steps to ensure our network is well positioned to benefit from technological innovation in transportation. As just one example, starting in 2018, we were the first company in our industry to launch a publicly-available commercial open platform autonomous offering in the United States.
Today, our offerings include an expanded set of transportation modes in select cities, such as access to a network of shared bikes and scooters (“Light Vehicles”) for shorter rides and first-mile and last-mile legs of multimodal trips, information about nearby public transit routes, and Lyft Rentals, an offering for renters who want to rent a car for a fixed period of time for personal use. We believe our transportation network offers a viable alternative to car ownership. We anticipate the demand for our offerings will grow as communities recover from the COVID-19 pandemic and as more and more people discover the convenience, experience and affordability of using Lyft.
We have made focused and substantial investments in support of our mission. For example, to continually launch new innovations on our platform, we have invested heavily in research and development and have completed multiple strategic acquisitions. We have also invested in sales and marketing to grow our community, cultivate a differentiated brand that resonates with drivers and riders and promote further brand awareness. Together, these investments have enabled us to create a powerful multimodal platform and scaled user network. For example, in the first quarter of 2020, we acquired Flexdrive, LLC (“Flexdrive”), one of our longstanding partners in the Express Drive program. Through our Express Drive program, drivers can enter into short-term rental agreements for vehicles that may be used to provide ridesharing services on the Lyft Platform. Flexdrive will continue to operate as an independent partner to Lyft and we expect this acquisition to contribute to the growth of our business and help us expand the range of our use cases. We also continue to invest in the expansion of our network of Light Vehicles and autonomous open platform technology. Our strategy is always to be at the forefront of transportation innovation, and we believe these investments will continue to position us as a leader in TaaS. Notwithstanding the impact of COVID-19, we plan to continue to invest in the future, both organically and through acquisitions of complementary businesses.
Even as we invest in the business, we remain focused on finding ways to operate more efficiently. For example, in the second and fourth quarters of 2020, we undertook restructuring efforts to reduce operating expenses and adjust cash flows in light of the ongoing economic challenges resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the Company’s business. In addition, we significantly decreased our 2020 capital expenditure spending from our original plan and exceeded our target cost reductions in 2020 
by 20%. We also decreased rider incentives to an all-time low in the second quarter of 2020 and maintained them near the historical low through the fourth quarter of 2020, resulting in a significant decrease in sales and marketing expenses. 
To advance our mission, we aim to build the defining brand of our generation and to advocate through our commitment to social and environmental responsibility. We believe that our brand represents freedom at your fingertips: freedom from the stresses of car ownership and freedom to do and see more. Through our LyftUp initiative, we’re working to make sure people have access to affordable, reliable transportation to get where they need to go - no matter their income or zip code. We’ve activated more than 500 nonprofit partners through LyftUp to provide free ride credits to those who need them most, including a focus on communities of color. We are also proud to be leaders in the fight against climate change. We’ve made the commitment to reach 100% electric vehicles (“EVs”) on the Lyft Platform by 2030. We believe many users are loyal to Lyft because of our values, brand and commitment to social and environmental responsibility. 
Our values, brand, innovation and focused execution have put us in a position to emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic even stronger. We remain confident that demand will return to our platform as we progress through the recovery and as vaccines become more widely available. We continue to believe that users are increasingly choosing a ridesharing platform based on brand affinity and value alignment. 
Impact of COVID-19 to our Business
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread throughout the United States, Canada, and in many other countries globally. The spread of COVID-19 has caused federal and local health officials to enact precautions to mitigate the spread of the virus, including travel restrictions, restrictions on businesses, extensive social distancing measures, and self-quarantine or shelter-in-place guidelines in many regions of the United States and Canada. Beginning in the middle of March 2020 and continuing into the first quarter of 2021, the pandemic and these related responses have caused decreased demand for our platform leading to decreased revenue, decreased earning opportunities for drivers on our platform, the global slowdown of economic activity (including the decrease in demand for a broad variety of goods and services), disruptions in global supply chains and significant volatility and disruption of financial markets; and these impacts may continue. 
For more information on risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and our litigation matters, see the section titled “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I. For more information on the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on our business, see the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 of Part II.
Lyft’s Market Opportunity
Transportation is a massive market. Transportation costs are a substantial expenditure for every household, often more than healthcare and entertainment expenditures. We believe we are still in the very early phases of capturing this massive opportunity as rideshare represents a small percentage of vehicle miles travelled. We also believe that we have a significant incremental opportunity to address transportation spend by businesses and organizations. Our market opportunity today includes transportation spend in the United States and Canada. In the transportation ecosystem, we are one of only two companies that have established a TaaS network at scale across the United States. 
Changes in society and the transportation industry are catalyzing a complete transformation of the massive transportation market:
•Consumers increasingly value accessibility and experiences over ownership
•Rise of on-demand services, specifically within the younger demographic
•Greater affinity towards mission-driven brands
•Increased demand for flexible earnings opportunities
•Emergence of new modes of transportation, such as our network of shared bikes and scooters
•Development of autonomous vehicles
The Lyft Solution
Our Transportation Network
Our transportation network offers riders seamless, personalized and on-demand access to a variety of mobility options.
Our transportation network is comprised of:
•Ridesharing Marketplace. Our core offering since 2012 connects drivers with riders who need to get somewhere. The scale of our network enables us to predict demand and proactively incentivize drivers to be available for rides in the right place at the right time. This allows us to optimize earning opportunities for drivers and offer convenient rides for riders, creating sustainable value to both sides of our marketplace. Our ridesharing marketplace connects drivers with riders in cities across the United States and in select cities in Canada. 
•Express Drive. Our flexible car rentals program for drivers who want to drive using our platform but do not have access to a vehicle that meets our requirements. Through our Express Drive program, drivers can enter into short-term rental agreements for vehicles that may be used to provide ridesharing services on the Lyft Platform. 
•Lyft Rentals. In 2019, we launched Lyft Rentals to offer an attractive option for users who have long-distance trips, such as a weekend away. This is a separate consumer offering from Express Drive.
•Bikes and Scooters. We have a network of shared bikes and scooters in a number of cities to address the needs of users who are looking for options that are more active, usually lower-priced, and often more efficient for short trips during heavy traffic. These modes can also help supplement the first-mile and last-mile of a multimodal trip with public transit. 
Lyft bikes are standard and electric pedal-assist bicycles. Lyft has exclusive city partnerships in a majority of locations where we operate a bikeshare program including New York City, Chicago, San Francisco, Portland and Boston. In 2020, we continued to make inroads with our electric bike fleet which is now available across nine markets. 
Users can access Lyft scooters via our Lyft App in six major cities in the United States. When in a service area, users can see available scooters nearby. They can reserve a scooter ahead of time or use the Lyft App to scan the QR code on a nearby scooter to begin a ride.
•Public Transit. Available in select cities, our Transit offering integrates third-party public transit data into the Lyft App to offer users a robust view of transportation options around them and allows them to see transit routes to their destinations at no cost. Providing real-time public transit information is another step toward providing effective, equitable and sustainable transportation to our communities, and creating a more seamless and connected transportation network. 
•Autonomous Vehicles. We have a number of strategic partnerships that offer access to autonomous vehicles. Our Open Platform partnership with Motional (formerly Aptiv) has enabled the commercial deployment of a fleet of autonomous vehicles on our platform in Las Vegas. We have facilitated over 100,000 paid rides in Motional autonomous vehicles with a safety driver since January 2018.
We have established one of the largest transportation networks in the United States and Canada. While network scale is important, we recognize that transportation happens locally and each market has its own unique user network. Our dynamic platform adjusts to the specific attributes of each market on a real-time basis.
Drivers
The drivers on our platform are active members of their communities. They are parents, students, business owners, retirees and everything in between. We work hard to serve the community of drivers on our platform, empowering them to be their own bosses and providing them the opportunity to focus their time on what matters most. Key benefits to drivers on our platform include:
•We offer drivers the flexibility to generate income on their own schedule, so they can best prioritize what is important in their lives.
•Our predictive technology around ride volume and demand enables us to share key information with drivers about when and where to drive in order to maximize their earnings on a real-time basis.
•We procure insurance that helps protect transportation network company (“TNC”) drivers against financial losses related to automobile accidents while on the platform. 
•To help us uphold high community standards, we give both drivers and riders the opportunity to rate each other after a ride booked through the Lyft App. If a rider or driver rates the ride three stars or below, they will not be matched together again. Lyft may also follow up with the parties to further understand the ride experience and provide additional support if needed. 
•All transactions are processed through our platform, so drivers do not need to worry about carrying cash.
•Our Driver Hubs and certain field locations in major cities serve as gathering places and offer in-person support and a personal connection to Lyft employees. In addition, drivers have access to 24/7 support and earnings tools as well as education resources and other support to meet their personal goals.
•On November 3, 2020, California voters passed Proposition 22, which protects independence and flexibility for drivers in California while providing them with new earnings opportunities and protections, including minimum guaranteed earnings, occupational accident insurance, and contributions towards healthcare coverage. 
Riders
We care deeply about the riders on our platform and work to build long-term relationships with them by:
•developing simple, elegant and intuitive solutions;
•focusing intensely on the user experience, including soliciting feedback and following up if necessary on the ride experience;
•engendering a sense of mutual respect and fair treatment; and 
•promoting trust and safety within our network.
We believe this approach fuels our word-of-mouth referrals and reinforces our community’s desire to use Lyft over alternatives.
Riders are as diverse and dynamic as the communities we serve. They represent all adult age groups and backgrounds and use Lyft to commute to and from work, explore their cities, spend more time at local businesses and stay out longer knowing they can get a reliable ride home. For the purposes of “Item 1. Business” section, riders are passengers who request rides from drivers in our ridesharing marketplace and renters of a shared bike, scooter or automobile.
We work hard to provide riders with a quality experience every time they open the Lyft App, in order to earn the right to have Lyft be their transportation network of choice. Key benefits to riders include:
•Selection and Convenience. We designed the Lyft App with a focus on simplicity, efficiency and convenience. Riders enter their destination and are then presented with a range of transportation options to select from based on their needs and preferences. Our proprietary technology efficiently matches riders with drivers through advanced dispatching algorithms providing faster arrival times, localized pricing and maximum availability. We continuously aim to reduce friction in the booking process with features like “one tap ride” so riders can enter their destinations quickly. Additional modes, such as bikes and scooters, offer riders more options for shorter trips. The more rides that are taken on our platform, the better we are able to offer riders personalized experiences most suitable to the trip being planned.
•Availability. We strive to ensure that riders can get a ride when they want one. We leverage our proprietary dispatch platform and data to help drivers and riders connect efficiently and reduce wait times. Our machine learning algorithms continuously train our optimization models and dynamically incentivize drivers to be on our platform when and where riders are seeking 
transportation. We are also expanding our network of shared bikes and scooters. The high availability of our platform and the breadth of our offerings have made us the preferred transportation network for millions of riders.
•Affordability. Our platform empowers riders to choose from a broad set of transportation options to easily optimize for cost, comfort and time. For our ridesharing marketplace, riders are presented with upfront estimated prices prior to taking the trip so they can anticipate the total cost. We also introduced lower-cost options for riders to get around in select cities, including Wait & Save mode, a network of shared bikes and scooters and Transit with affordability in mind.
•Safety. Since day one, we have worked continuously to enhance the safety of our platform and the ridesharing industry by developing innovative products, policies and processes. Before giving a ride on the Lyft Platform, all driver-applicants are screened for disqualifying criminal offenses and driving incidents. All approved drivers are also required to complete mandatory Community Safety Education. We conduct monitoring of active Lyft drivers, which provides us with continuous and rapid notification of disqualifying criminal records and driving infractions. 
Our Technology Infrastructure and Operations
We organize our product teams with a full-stack development model, integrating product management, engineering, analytics, data science and design. We focus on affordability, reliability, efficiency, optimization and cohesion when developing our software. Our offerings are mobile-first and platform agnostic. We seek to continuously improve the Lyft Platform and the Lyft App. Our offerings are built on a scalable technology platform that enables us to manage peaks in demand.
We have a commercial agreement with AWS for cloud services to help deliver and host our platform. As a result of our partnership, we believe we are more resilient to surges in demand on our platform or product changes we may introduce. Our commercial agreement with AWS will remain in effect until terminated by AWS or us. AWS may only terminate the agreement for convenience after September 30, 2022, and only after complying with certain advance notice requirements. AWS may also terminate the agreement for cause upon a breach of the agreement or for failure to pay amounts due, in each case, subject to AWS providing prior written notice and a 30-day cure period. We committed to spend an aggregate of at least $300 million between January 2019 and June 2022 on AWS services, with a minimum amount of $80 million in each of the three years. If we fail to meet the minimum purchase commitment during any year, we may be required to pay the difference. We pay AWS monthly, and we may pay more than the minimum purchase commitment to AWS based on usage.
We designed our platform with multiple layers of redundancy to guard against data loss and deliver high availability. Incremental backups are performed hourly or more frequently and full backups are performed daily. In addition, as a default, redundant copies of content are stored independently in at least two separate geographic regions and replicated reliably within each region. We are also investing in iterating and continuously improving our data privacy and security foundation, and continually review and implement the most relevant policies.
Our Intellectual Property
We believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business. We rely on trademarks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets, license agreements, intellectual property assignment agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements and employee non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Though we rely in part upon these legal and contractual protections, we believe that factors such as the skills and ingenuity of our employees and the functionality and frequent enhancements to our solutions are larger contributors to our success in the marketplace.
We have invested in a patent program to identify and protect a substantial portion of our strategic intellectual property in ridesharing, autonomous vehicle-related technology, telecommunications, networking and other technologies relevant to our business. As of December 31, 2020, we held 342 issued U.S. patents and had 446 U.S. patent applications pending. We also held 59 issued patents in foreign jurisdictions and had 223 applications pending in foreign jurisdictions. We continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property.
We have an ongoing trademark and service mark registration program pursuant to which we register our brand names and product names, taglines and logos in the United States and other countries to the extent we determine appropriate and cost-effective. We also have common law rights in some trademarks. In addition, we have registered domain names for websites that we use in our business, such as www.lyft.com and other variations.
We intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost-effective. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, they may not be respected in the future or may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. For additional information, see the sections titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Regulatory and Legal Factors—Claims by others that we infringed their proprietary technology or other intellectual property rights could harm our business” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Regulatory and Legal Factors—Failure to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.”
Our Growth Strategy
Transportation is a massive market. We are in the very early phase of capturing this large opportunity. Our key growth strategies include our plans to:
•Increase Our Use Cases. We continuously work to extend our offerings to make Lyft the transportation network of choice across an expanding range of use cases. We offer products to simplify travel decision-making and expand the potential uses for our platform, such as our Lyft Pink subscription plan, Lyft Pass commuter programs, first-mile and last-mile services and university safe rides programs. We also provide centralized tools and enterprise transportation solutions tailored to businesses, such as our Concierge offering, which enables organizations to manage the transportation needs of their customers, employees and constituents.
•Recovery and Growth Of Our Rider Base. We see opportunities to recoup and grow our rider base as the COVID-19 pandemic ends. We intend to make incremental investments in our brand and growth marketing to increase consumer preference as the recovery takes hold. We also may offer discounts for first time riders to try Lyft and incentives for existing drivers and riders. We plan to continue to add density to our ridesharing marketplace by attracting and retaining drivers to our platform to further improve the rider experience. Additionally, we are expanding our platform coverage beyond the geographies and markets we currently serve. We also believe we will benefit from demographic trends, such as the growing percentage of the population who are born as digital natives accustomed to on-demand services.
•Expand Our Transportation Offerings. We continue to make Lyft an everyday experience for riders through our transportation network designed to address a wide range of mobility needs. For example, in 2018, we launched a network of shared bikes and scooters, and will continue to supplement and scale modes in order to offer riders more transportation options. In 2019, we added Lyft Rentals to add an attractive option for users planning to travel longer distances. More recently in 2020, we launched Wait & Save, where riders can opt for a longer wait time but pay a lower fare than for a standard ride mode. By expanding our transportation offerings, we can offer riders options that best fit their criteria directly from the Lyft App, which increases rider engagement.
•Grow Our Share of Rider Transportation Spend. As we continue to increase rider loyalty to our brand and expand our use cases and the breadth of our multimodal offerings, we believe we will also increase our share of rider transportation spend. For example, a rider may start using our ridesharing offering for a night out and then choose Lyft again for travel to the airport. Once they have experienced the reliability and convenience of Lyft, they may incorporate Wait & Save into their daily commute, rent one of our shared bikes or scooters for shorter rides or when connecting to public transit, and rent one of our Lyft Rentals vehicles for long-distance trips, like a weekend away. We are also investing to increase our share of more valuable rides to grow our share of rider transportation spend. In addition, usage of our platform typically increases over time.
•Increase Value to the Driver Community. We strive to provide the best and most fulfilling economic opportunities for the community of drivers on our platform. We continuously seek to launch and improve programs and initiatives that enhance the driver experience on our platform. Our Express Drive program connects drivers with rental cars and in the first quarter of 2020, we acquired Flexdrive, one of our longstanding partners in the Express Drive program. We are also investing in Driver Centers, Mobile Services, and related partnerships that offer affordable and convenient vehicle maintenance to the driver community. In addition to helping drivers access and maintain vehicles, we are committed to delivering innovative solutions that offer drivers fast and affordable access to their earnings. For example, we were the first ridesharing company to offer instant payouts to drivers through the Lyft App when we launched Express Pay in 2015. In 2019, we further improved access to driver earnings by launching Lyft Direct, our no-fee bank account and debit card for drivers that allows drivers to receive payment instantly after every ride. In 2020, we launched Essential Deliveries, a pilot initiative which provides drivers with new earnings opportunities by connecting them to government agencies, local non-profits, healthcare organizations, and other companies that need delivery services for items like food, groceries, prescriptions, medical supplies, home necessities, and auto parts. We believe that our efforts to improve the driver experience allows us to increase driver satisfaction and loyalty to Lyft. 
•Invest in Technology to Strengthen Our Network and Increase Efficiency. Our investments in proprietary technologies and predictive analytics leverage insights derived from the rich set of data generated by our platform. These investments allow us to deliver an affordable, convenient and high-quality experience for riders and increase the earnings of drivers. Our investments in mapping, routing, payments, in-app navigation, matching technologies and data science are key to integrating technology to improve the safety and increase the efficiency of our platform. In addition, we are investing in autonomous vehicle-related technology, which we believe will be a critical part of the future of transportation. We recently announced that we were considering strategic options for our Level 5 self-driving system development program.
•Pursue M&A and Strategic Partnerships. In November 2018, we acquired Motivate, the largest bike sharing platform in the United States at the time and in February 2020, we acquired Flexdrive, one of our longstanding Express Drive partners. From time to time, we have made other acquisitions of businesses and technologies. We will continue to selectively pursue acquisitions that contribute to the growth of our current business, help us expand into adjacent markets or add new capabilities to our platform. We believe drivers and riders on our platform will also benefit from a broader partner ecosystem 
that expands our marketing and loyalty programs and employee ride solutions. We have built strong relationships with transportation suppliers, state and local governments, and technology solutions providers. We intend to continue to pursue acquisitions and partnerships that contribute to our growth.
Competition
The market for TaaS networks is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid changes in technology, shifting rider needs and frequent introductions of new services and offerings. We expect competition to continue, both from current competitors and new entrants in the market that may be well-established and enjoy greater resources or other strategic advantages. If we are unable to anticipate or successfully react to these competitive challenges in a timely manner, our competitive position could weaken, or fail to improve, and we could experience a decline in revenue or growth stagnation that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our main ridesharing competitors in the United States and Canada include Uber and Via. Our main competitors in the bike and scooter sharing market include Lime and Bird. Our main competitors in the consumer vehicle rental market include Enterprise, Hertz, and Avis Budget Group as well as emerging car-share marketplaces. We also compete with certain non-ridesharing transportation network companies, and taxi cab and livery companies as well as traditional automotive manufacturers, such as BMW, which has an ongoing presence in the transportation network market in Europe.
Additionally, there are other non-U.S.-based TaaS network companies that may expand into the United States and Canada. There are also a number of companies developing autonomous vehicle technology that may compete with us in the future, including Alphabet (Waymo), Amazon (Zoox), Apple, Argo AI, Aurora, Baidu and General Motors (Cruise) as well as many other technology companies and automobile manufacturers and suppliers. We anticipate continued challenges from current competitors as well as from new entrants into the TaaS market.
We believe that the principal competitive factors in our market include the following:
•coverage and availability of access and service levels;
•scale of network;
•choice of modality;
•product design;
•ease of adoption and use;
•features and platform experience;
•partnerships and integrations with other ecosystem participants;
•brand;
•trust, safety, reliability and privacy;
•customer support;
•continued innovation in new modalities;
•driver payout;
•regulatory relations; 
•sustainability; and
•prices.
We believe we compete favorably across these factors. However, many of our competitors and potential competitors are larger and have greater brand name recognition, longer operating histories, larger marketing budgets and established marketing relationships, access to larger customer bases and significantly greater resources for the development of their offerings. For additional information about the risks to our business related to competition, see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Operational Factors—We face intense competition and could lose market share to our competitors, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.”
Seasonality
The revenue we generate from our business may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to seasonal factors including the weather and certain holidays. We expect the demand for our transportation network may decline over the winter season in certain regions and the demand for our network of shared bikes and scooters may increase during more temperate and dry seasons. Our business is also subject to risks related to COVID-19. In particular, travel bans and restrictions, as well as shelter in place orders have decreased demand and we are unable to predict when and to what extent these public health and safety measures may be eased, how 
riders will respond to the easing of such measures, and whether additional measures may need to be implemented in the future, any of which may continue to result in decreased demand notwithstanding usual seasonality. 
Our Brand and Marketing
We aim to build the defining brand of our generation. We believe that our brand represents freedom at your fingertips: freedom from the stresses of driving and car ownership, and freedom to do and see more. Our unique values and culture are reflected in our brand. We drive awareness of our brand through our marketing efforts, which highlight our offerings, the simplicity of our user experience and our commitment to community, and we also benefit from the evangelism by our users.
Values and Culture
Building community and having a positive local impact is fundamental to who we are. We approach working with our partners, cities and municipalities in a collaborative manner and seek to establish mutually beneficial relationships based on trust, respect and a common objective of improving people’s lives by improving transportation. 
Millions of people lack access to basic needs because they can’t get a ride. Through our LyftUp initiative, we’re working to make sure everyone has access to affordable, reliable transportation to get where they need to go — no matter their income or zip code.
We built LyftUp to account for those still left behind. LyftUp aims to bridge some of the most serious outstanding transportation gaps. Through our LyftUp programs, we partner with leading organizations, including government agencies and nonprofits, to provide access to free and discounted car, bike, and scooter rides to individuals and families in need. 
2020 LyftUp programs included:
•Grocery Access - rides to/from the grocery store for families living in areas without sufficient grocery store access and meal delivery to individuals in need;
•Jobs Access - rides to/from job interviews, job trainings, and/or the first few weeks of a new job;
•Voting Access - rides to the polls;
•Disaster Response - rides to access vital services leading up to and in the wake of disasters and other local emergencies;
•Multimodal Access - deeply discounted bikeshare and scooter share memberships for eligible applicants who qualify for federal/state/local assistance programs;
•Critical Workforce Programs - providing critical workers including first-responders, healthcare, and transit workforce free scooter rides and free memberships to bikeshare programs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic;
•Universal Vaccine Access Campaign - mobilizing a coalition of partners to provide rides to and from vaccination sites for low-income, underinsured, and at-risk communities, as the COVID-19 vaccine becomes more widely available; and
•Community Grants Program - awards ride credits to hyperlocal nonprofit organizations across the country making a difference in their communities. 
All of this work directly ties back to Lyft’s mission of improving people’s lives with the world's best transportation, and we’re proud to work with amazing community partners to bring these programs to life.
Lastly, Lyft was founded on the belief that technology will enable us to dramatically reduce carbon emissions from the transportation system. We now offer several lower-carbon modes in the Lyft App: bikes, scooters, and transit. In 2019, Lyft launched access to hundreds of EVs on the Lyft Platform through Express Drive in Seattle, Atlanta, and Denver, and in 2020, Lyft made the commitment to reach 100% electric vehicles on the Lyft Platform by 2030 and joined The Climate Group’s EV100 initiative to accelerate the transition to EVs.
Brand Marketing
Our marketing efforts are designed to educate people about Lyft in creative and memorable ways, generating brand awareness among potential drivers and riders. 
•Lyft-Produced Content. Lyft will produce content and post on various platforms, such as Undercover Lyft where celebrities are disguised as drivers.
•Popular Culture. Ad placement in pop culture such as television series and movies.
•Marketing Partnerships. We have marketing partnerships with leading brands, such as J.P. Morgan (Chase), Delta Air Lines, Hilton, and Walt Disney Parks & Resorts.
•Local Events. Our goal in sponsoring local events is to boost brand awareness at locally relevant times and use cases.
•Outdoor Advertising. To build unaided awareness, we have outdoor billboard campaigns in key markets.
•Specialty Modes. In select markets, riders may experience specialty or promotional ride modes for local events and organizations.
•Lyft Amp. Lyft Amps are bright, oval-shaped devices that sit on certain drivers’ dashboards which enhance the user experience, boost our brand awareness, and help promote safety. Amps assist rider identification of their driver’s vehicles and also display a personalized greeting and ETA to inform riders of the estimated time to their destination. 
Performance Marketing
We use a variety of channels to drive adoption of our platform and maintain driver and rider loyalty. We use specific channels and initiatives that enable us to measure the impact of our marketing spend. We currently attract new drivers and riders through a variety of marketing channels, including referrals, affiliate programs, partnerships, display advertising, radio, video, social media, email, search engine optimization and keyword search campaigns. After signup, we continue to engage riders through a variety of initiatives, such as emails, in-app notifications and promotions.
Our Proprietary Data-Driven Technology Platform
Our robust technology platform powers the millions of rides and connections that we facilitate every day and provides insights that drive our platform in real-time. We leverage historical data to continuously improve experiences for drivers and riders on our platform. Our platform analyzes large datasets covering the ride lifecycle, from when drivers go online and riders request rides, to when they match, which route to take and any feedback given after the rides. Utilizing machine learning capabilities to predict future behavior based on many years of historical data and use cases, we employ various levers to balance supply and demand in the marketplace, creating increased driver earnings while maintaining strong service levels for riders. We also leverage our data science and algorithms to inform our product development, such as the introduction of Lyft Pink.
Ridesharing Marketplace Efficiency
During the matching process, we leverage our proprietary dispatch platform and data to help drivers and riders connect efficiently. Factors such as distance, destination, route, traffic and travel time contribute to determining both driver to rider matching for our rideshare offerings including our Wait & Save mode, as well as rider-to-rider matching for our shared rides offerings, which is currently paused as a result of COVID-19. Prior to a match, we give drivers a simple, reliable signal about where to drive and often an incentive to increase earnings. We also focus on providing predictable, competitive and sustainable prices that optimize value for riders as well as help increase conversion. Our machine learning algorithms continuously train our optimization models and dynamically balance current and future supply and demand within the marketplace.
Optimizing Marketplace Supply
Once drivers sign up and begin driving, our predictive analytics and dynamic pricing algorithms help us to align driver incentives to encourage drivers to be available, at the right times, in areas of high demand. This helps provide drivers with potentially higher earning opportunities by allowing them to maximize their earnings per hour, which can elevate driver satisfaction, increase supply in peak hours and improve the overall efficiency of the marketplace.
Managing and Anticipating Rider Demand
Our pricing algorithms use real-time ride cost estimates, demand elasticity and data about traffic, weather and other travel conditions to optimize ride prices and balance supply and demand in our ridesharing marketplace. This allows us to offer consistently competitive ride prices, reduce rider wait times and maximize rider utilization of our platform, which we believe leads to long-term driver and rider loyalty.
The Lyft Driver Experience
We help drivers on our platform generate earnings while maintaining a flexible schedule. For these drivers, it all begins with the Lyft Driver App. After extensive background and safety checks, drivers can gain access to our platform and begin driving.
•The Lyft Driver App. Drivers only have to tap ‘Go Online’ in the Lyft Driver App to begin receiving ride requests. Once matched, drivers will get a notification to accept the ride and receive the rider’s pickup spot. On-screen instructions and directions make it easy to pick up riders, navigate to destinations and drop off riders. Drivers and riders may then rate each other at the end of the ride.
•Driver Dashboard. In the Lyft Driver App, we offer drivers a dashboard that shows the total earnings they can expect to see transferred to their bank accounts. In this dashboard, we offer detailed views of earnings activity, ride count and time spent, to help drivers understand and maximize their earnings. We provide an in-app Driver Console with additional tools and analytics to help drivers measure ride demand, pinpoint the best times to drive each day, set earnings goals and help them monitor their earnings progress. Drivers also gain real-time visibility into currently available incentives.
•Lyft Direct. We offer drivers an online bank account and debit card. Drivers with a Lyft Direct debit card get access to their earnings immediately after a ride is completed without any transfer or rush fees. In addition, drivers who use the card receive cash back on everyday purchases like gas. 
•In-app Tipping. Lyft was the first ridesharing platform to offer In-app Tipping, making it easy for riders to tip right from the app. 100% of tips from riders go to drivers. We built tipping into the Lyft App to encourage great hospitality, and to make it easy for riders to show their appreciation. 
•Driver Destination Mode. Destination Mode matches drivers with ride requests that get them closer to their intended destination by a specific time. We allow drivers to set a targeted arrival time so they can maximize earnings until the time they choose to go offline, or we allow them to specify a destination so they only receive priority matched ride requests going in the same direction.
•Express Drive. Express Drive is our flexible car rentals program for drivers. It is designed for those who want to drive using our platform but do not have access to a vehicle that meets our requirements. Express Drive offers a preferred weekly rate on cars rented from Hertz and Flexdrive. There are cars available in over 30 cities nationwide through Express Drive and includes EVs in Seattle, Atlanta, and Denver.
•Driver Hubs. Our Driver Hubs and service desks are currently in 40 cities across North America. These facilities are used for driver onboarding, answering driver questions and providing free inspections in select markets. They feature access to clean bathrooms and help desks for easy access to the Lyft support team.
•Driver Centers and Mobile Services. Lyft Driver Centers offer standard maintenance as well as services and repairs including free diagnostic inspection. Mobile Services bring auto repairs, including preventative maintenance, directly to the driver. 
•Lyft Rewards. Drivers in over 275 markets are automatically eligible for Lyft Rewards, a driver loyalty program that rewards drivers with features and discounts to help them make the most of their time on the road. 
The Lyft Rider Experience
We provide a variety of offerings to solve the transportation needs of riders. This starts with the Lyft App, which is a core part of the rider experience. To provide riders with the best experience, we are also continually adding new features, rider modes and payment models to address the needs of specific groups of riders, such as businesses and government entities.
Lyft App
The Lyft App provides a variety of ride modes to fit users’ transportation needs. The Lyft App is designed to be fast, simple and purposeful. When a user opens the Lyft App, all ride options available in that location are shown in a unified experience including scooters, bikes, public transit, car rentals, regular rides, larger vehicle rides, and even more. 
Subscription Plans
Offering subscription plans allows us to provide more earning opportunities for drivers and is an important step toward providing transportation options to address the range of riders’ budgets and make car ownership optional. Lyft Pink is our subscription program that offers an elevated Lyft experience with preferred pricing to enable users to unlock all that their city has to offer. Lyft Pink members receive valuable benefits such as discounts, relaxed cancellations, priority airport pick-ups, access to unlimited, free, in-network food delivery through our partnership with Grubhub+, and more. 
Lyft Business
Lyft is evolving how businesses large and small take care of their people’s transportation needs across sectors including corporate, healthcare, auto, education and government. Our comprehensive set of solutions allows customers to design, manage and pay for ground transportation programs that contribute to productivity and satisfaction while reducing cost, improving transparency and streamlining operations. 
Corporate Business Travel
We partner with leading travel and expense management companies to deliver seamless experiences that are changing how our customers do business by making travel easier for everyone involved. Tools and features such as automated expensing and 
centralized payment improve policy adherence for travelers and offer greater visibility for travel managers. Benefits such as real-time reporting on rides and costs as well as detailed ride data and classification make it easier to attribute, reconcile and reimburse expense spend.
Concierge
Originally developed for large healthcare partners to help improve access to quality care, our Concierge offering is now used by organizations of all types to access our network and request or schedule rides for other people. The majority of our ride modes are available through Concierge with features including real-time ride tracking, 24-hour customer support and the option to request a ride for someone as soon as they are ready or schedule a ride up to a week in advance. Organizations can also choose to build a seamless transportation experience in their own applications using the Lyft Concierge API. 
Key benefits of Concierge are:
•Simplifying Transportation for Businesses. Concierge allows organizations to arrange rides for their customers, guests and patients from one central dashboard, even if they don’t have the Lyft App or a smartphone. Customers can reduce cost, save time and streamline transportation with our courtesy ride tool.
•Improving Healthcare. Many Americans miss or delay medical care annually because they cannot get a ride to the doctor. Healthcare transportation brokers use our Concierge offering to provide patients with a reliable way to get to important healthcare appointments on time.
Lyft Pass
Lyft Pass allows organizations to cover the costs of rides for their people - from employees and essential workers, to customers, guests, and more - while prioritizing safety, convenience, and flexibility. Lyft Pass allows organizations to create custom transportation programs that work best for their needs, while staying in control of budget and how the programs are used. At the onset of the COVID-19 crisis, we partnered with health systems to help essential healthcare workers on the front lines get to and from work. And today, leading companies are partnering with Lyft to solve their employee’s transportation needs. 
Enterprise Programs
We offer various enterprise programs, including monthly ride credits for daily commutes, supplementing public transit by providing access to rides for the first and last leg of commute trips, late-night rides home and shuttle replacement rides. Companies can provide monthly Lyft credits as a benefit to employees to ensure convenient and cost-effective late-night transportation from the office.
Events
We enable transportation solutions that can be customized for events such as recruiting events, conferences, celebrations, meetings and company retreats. Organizations or individuals can create in-app experiences and custom codes for attendees to ride to and from events.
Our Commitment to Safety
A strong guiding principle since day one has been to build a community that drivers and riders trust. Trust is the foundation of our relationship with drivers and riders on our platform, and we take significant measures every day that are focused on their safety. 
To ensure we are delivering exceptional service levels and upholding high quality standards, we have established our Safety and Customer Care, or SCC (formerly known as Customer Experience and Trust), team as a key part of our organization. With over 400 employees as of December 31, 2020, SCC is in charge of fielding safety and customer support inquiries and is available through multiple channels, including via self-service and assisted support directly within our apps. Our SCC team focuses on driving results based on experience-based metrics including First Contact Resolution, which is the number of support tickets resolved during first contact with a driver or rider, and Net Promoter Score. SCC aims to eliminate bad customer experiences, quickly resolve problems when they occur and maintain trust with drivers and riders. This dedication led our customer support to be recently named number one in Newsweek’s 2020 America’s Best Customer Service rankings for the Taxi and Ridesharing category. 
The ways we promote safety include:
•Critical Response Line. Our team of specialists within SCC handle sensitive issues regarding behavior or safety incidents on our platform. Available 24/7, they work with many teams to provide a high quality of care.
•Driving Record and Background Checks. Every driver is screened before they are permitted to drive on our platform, starting with professional third-party background and driving record checks. To promote a consistently high-quality experience, we ensure vehicles meet our criteria for vehicle age before drivers are accepted to drive these vehicles on our platform. We conduct monitoring of active Lyft drivers, which provides us with continuous and expeditious notification of 
disqualifying criminal records and driving infractions. Any driver who does not meet applicable regulations and our internal safety criteria on both the annual and continuous screenings is barred from our platform.
•Two-Way Ratings. Our two-way ratings system helps promote the safety and comfort of the Lyft community by offering a channel for drivers and riders to provide anonymous feedback on their Lyft experiences through the Lyft App. At the end of each ride, drivers and riders are prompted to rate each other on a scale of 1-5 stars. Our ratings system allows drivers and riders to provide anonymous feedback. We take rider ratings and driver feedback very seriously. If a rider rates a driver three stars or fewer, we’ll make sure they aren’t matched together again. If a rider rates a driver four stars or fewer, they’re required to provide more details about the rating to ensure we’re constantly tracking user feedback. We regularly review community feedback to inform our policies and product features. 
•Zero-Tolerance Policy. Lyft maintains a zero-tolerance drug and alcohol policy for drivers on our platform. We also do not allow riders to have open alcohol containers in-ride and can deactivate riders from the platform for violating this policy.
•Community Safety Education. All approved drivers are required to complete a mandatory community safety education course. 
•Safety Features. We continuously invest in new safety features, including increased anti-fraud measures and required feedback for any rides less than four stars. During the ride, we have designed numerous safety features into the Lyft experience and will continue to innovate to ensure the safety of riders and drivers. Some recently designed safety features include: 
◦Share Location, which allows riders and drivers to share their location with family and friends; 
◦Emergency Help, supported by ADT, which allows drivers and riders to quickly and silently connect with an ADT professional, who can alert authorities if needed;
◦Smart Trip Check-In, in some cases, if we notice your ride has stopped too soon or for an unusual amount of time, Lyft will ask drivers and riders if they need support and, if necessary, give the option to request emergency assistance;
◦In-app photos of the driver and vehicle, with license plate numbers and vehicle information;
◦Real-time ride tracking, digital receipts; and
◦Enhanced identity verification process, which combines driver's license verification and photographic identity verification to prevent identity fraud on our platform.
•Lyft Insurance Protection. We provide primary liability coverage for TNC drivers from the moment they are matched with a rider until that rider is dropped off. Our auto liability insurance will apply as primary to a driver’s standard personal automobile insurance policy when matched with a rider.
•Bikes and Scooters. Safety is a key tenet that guides our work with bikes and scooters. We are providing the necessary education and support for all riders and are working with partners to provide the capital and technology solutions to expand protected bike lanes and reduce speeding. We are working with organizations, like Together For Safer Roads and the Vision Zero Network, that collaborate with local bike and pedestrian advocates to help protect our community members. We are also giving away free helmets to select groups of riders in select markets.
Government Regulation
We are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions. Laws, regulations and standards governing issues such as TNCs, public companies, ridesharing, worker classification, labor and employment, anti-discrimination, payments, gift cards, whistleblowing and worker confidentiality obligations, product liability, defects, auto maintenance and repairs, personal injury, text messaging, subscription services, intellectual property, consumer protection, taxation, privacy, data security, competition, unionizing and collective action, arbitration agreements and class action waiver provisions, terms of service, mobile application accessibility, autonomous vehicles, bike and scooter sharing, insurance, vehicle rentals, money transmittal, non-emergency medical transportation, environmental health and safety, greenhouse gas emissions, background checks, public health, anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and delivery of goods including (but not limited to) medical supplies, perishable foods and prescription drugs are often complex and subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity. As a result, their application in practice may change or develop over time through judicial decisions or as new guidance or interpretations are provided by regulatory and governing bodies, such as federal, state and local administrative agencies.
The TNC industry has also come under increasing scrutiny from non-profit organizations, regulators, and legislators for its environmental impact, specifically increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In 2018, California passed first-of-its-kind legislation (the “California Clean Miles Standard and Incentive Program”) to mandate that TNCs reduce their GHG emissions on a GHG per passenger-mile basis, with additional requirements that TNCs increase the percentage of zero-emission vehicles on their platforms. 
Policymakers recently proposed analogous legislation in Washington state, and other states and the federal government are actively observing the regulatory development process for the California Clean Miles Standard and Incentive Program.

Human Capital
Our employees are our human capital and they are our greatest strength and most valuable resource. As of December 31, 2020, we had 4,675 employees in approximately 100 offices and additional locations, including Driver Hubs, Driver Centers, and Service Desks. Approximately 48% of our employees work in our product management, engineering, design and science organizations. Our employees are passionate about our mission to improve people’s lives with the world’s best transportation. 
We believe that achieving more diversity in workforce representation is an important priority. We are a company with a diverse customer base, and the more our employees reflect that diversity, the better we can serve our customers, ultimately making our business stronger. As of December 31, 2020, our employee base was 62% male and 38% female, and women represented 34% of our leadership overall. The ethnicity of our U.S. employees was 47% White, 30% Asian, 10% Hispanic or Latinx, 8% Black, and 5% two or more races, American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander. Our employee gender and ethnicity information is based on self-identification, and employees who did not disclose their gender or ethnicity have been excluded from the applicable disclosure. As of December 31, 2020, employees who did not disclose gender represented approximately 1% of total employees, and employees who did not disclose ethnicity represented approximately 7% of total U.S. employees. 
Building a more representative workforce requires an intentional and comprehensive effort to reach and recruit outstanding candidates, develop talent internally, and open up pathways for advancement. In 2020, we initiated difficult yet necessary conversations to align and inspire our entire organization. We educated our leaders and managers on unconscious bias and practicing empathy, while also encouraging team members to speak openly and honestly about societal inequalities. We launched new initiatives like our revised “Rooney Rule 2.0,” which requires all director level and above roles to consider one woman and one Black or Latinx candidate at the onsite interview stage, and we have partnered with organizations that support emerging talent in communities of color. We will continue to prioritize diversity, inclusion, and representation in the workforce. In December 2020, we released our 2020 Inclusion, Diversity and Racial Equity Report, which is available on our website. We have presented this report annually since 2017 and intend to continue to present this report to make available certain information about our diversity and inclusion efforts.
None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we believe that our employee relations are strong.
