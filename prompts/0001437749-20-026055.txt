Item 1. BUSINESS
 
National Holdings Corporation (“National,” “we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company”) is a full-service investment banking and asset management firm that operates through its wholly-owned subsidiaries which principally provide financial services. Through our broker-dealer and investment advisory subsidiaries, we (1) offer full service retail brokerage services to individual, corporate and institutional clients, (2) provide investment banking, merger and acquisition and advisory services to high-growth micro-, small- and mid-cap companies and (3) trade securities, including making markets in micro- and small-cap stocks listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) and other exchanges.
 
National is a Delaware corporation organized in 1996. Our broker-dealer subsidiaries are National Securities Corporation, a Washington corporation (“NSC”), and Winslow, Evans & Crocker, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation (“WEC”). NSC conducts a national securities brokerage business through its main offices in New York City, New York and Boca Raton, Florida. NSC is an introducing broker and clears all transactions through clearing organizations on a fully disclosed basis. WEC is a Boston-based, full-service investment firm established in 1991. NSC and WEC are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and are members of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”), Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (“MSRB”) and Securities Investor Protection Corporation (the “SIPC”).
 
Our brokers, who we also refer to as our registered representatives, operate either as independent contractors or employees. An independent contractor registered representative typically establishes such representative’s own office and is responsible for the payment of expenses associated with the operation of such office, including rent, utilities, furniture, computer and other equipment, market data, software and general office supplies. As a result, such independent contractor registered representative is entitled to retain a higher percentage of the commissions generated by such representative’s sales than a registered representative employee at a traditional employee-based brokerage firm. This arrangement allows us to operate with a reduced amount of fixed costs and lowers the risk of operational losses for less productive independent contractor registered representatives. A registered representative employee is provided with office space, technology, regulatory support and administrative support in exchange for a lower retention percentage of such employee’s production.
 
Our wholly-owned subsidiary, National Asset Management, Inc., a Washington corporation (“NAM”), is a federally-registered investment advisor providing asset management advisory services to retail clients for a fee based upon a percentage of assets managed.
 
Our wholly-owned subsidiaries, National Insurance Corporation, a Washington corporation (“National Insurance”), and Prime Financial Services, a Delaware corporation (“Prime Financial”), provide fixed insurance products to their clients, including life insurance, disability insurance, long-term care insurance and fixed annuities.
 
Our wholly-owned subsidiary, National Tax and Financial Services, Inc. (“National Tax”) formerly Gilman Ciocia, Inc., a Delaware corporation, provides tax preparation services to individuals, predominantly in the middle- and upper-income tax brackets and accounting services to small and midsize companies.
 
Our wholly-owned subsidiary, GC Capital Corporation, a Delaware corporation (“GC”), provides licensed mortgage brokerage services in New York and Florida.
 
Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Winslow, Evans & Crocker Insurance Agency, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation (“WIA”), provides fixed insurance products to its clients, and our wholly-owned subsidiary, Winslow Financial, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation (“WF”), is an SEC Registered Investment Advisor.
 
Our wholly-owned subsidiary, United Advisors, LLC, a New Jersey limited liability company (“UA”), is a New York-based, advisor and wealth management firm. United Advisor Services, LLC, a New Jersey limited liability company (“UAS”), is an SEC Registered Investment Advisor, and Financial Services International Corporation, a Washington corporation (“FSIC”), is a FINRA registered broker-dealer.
 
Proposal
 
On November 14, 2018, B. Riley Financial, Inc. (“B. Riley”) and FBIO Acquisition, Inc. (“FBIO Acquisition”), a subsidiary of Fortress Biotech, Inc, entered into a stock purchase agreement whereby FBIO Acquisition agreed to sell FBIO Acquisition’s majority stake in the Company to a wholly owned subsidiary of B. Riley (the “FBIO Sale”).  In connection with the FBIO Sale, the Company entered into an agreement with B. Riley (the “B. Riley Agreement”), pursuant to which B. Riley agreed to certain customary standstill provisions, effective as of the date of the B. Riley Agreement through December 31, 2021. 
 
On April 30, 2020, B. Riley and the Company entered into a limited waiver of certain provisions of the B. Riley Agreement and in connection therewith, B. Riley amended its Schedule 13D filing relating to the Company and sent the Board of Directors (the “Board”) a letter containing a proposal regarding the Company. The Board formed a Special Committee of non-executive, independent directors to review the B. Riley proposal.

COVID-19 Update and Action
 
The COVID-19 outbreak continues to cause significant disruption in business activity and the financial markets both globally and in the United States. As a result of the spread of COVID-19, economic uncertainties have arisen which have negatively impacted and are likely to continue to negatively impact our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, strategies and prospects. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our operational and financial performance will depend on certain developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak and impact on our clients, employees, vendors and the markets in which we operate our businesses, all of which are uncertain at this time and cannot be predicted. The extent to which COVID-19 may impact our financial condition or results of operations cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.
 
The Company’s management put cost-savings plans into effect to mitigate the cash drain that potential, downward pressure on its business might cause. In particular, the Company’s management made the very difficult decision to downsize its staff, significantly reduce compensation for many employees and implement moratoriums in variable spending categories.
 
We continue to be cautious due to events that may be driven by the evolution of this pandemic that are unknown, are highly uncertain, and cannot be predicted as it relates to the Company’s clients, employees, vendors, and the markets in which the Company operates its businesses.
 
Paycheck Protection Program
 
On April 10, 2020, NSC entered into a Promissory Note (the “NSC Note”) with Axos Bank as the lender (the “Lender”), pursuant to which the Lender agreed to make a loan to NSC in the principal amount of $5,523,738 under the Paycheck Protection Program (the “NSC Loan”) offered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (the “SBA”) pursuant to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act to qualified small businesses (the “PPP”). On April 15, 2020, WEC also entered into a Promissory Note (the “WEC Note” and together with the NSC Note, the “PPP Notes”) with the Lender, pursuant to which the Lender agreed to make a loan to WEC in the principal amount of $973,062 under the PPP (the “WEC Loan” and together with the NSC Loan, the “PPP Loans”).
 
The interest rate on each PPP Note is a fixed rate of 1% per annum. Interest is calculated by applying the ratio of the interest rate over a year of 360 days, multiplied by the outstanding principal balance, multiplied by the actual number of days the principal balance is outstanding. The applicable borrower is required to make monthly payments commencing on the first day of the first full calendar month following the end of a statutorily defined deferral period (the “Deferral Period”), and such payments shall continue to be due and payable on the first day of each calendar month thereafter until the date that is two (2) years following the funding date (the “Maturity Date”), which is April 13, 2022 in the case of the NSC Note and April 16, 2022 in the case of the WEC Note. Monthly payment amounts are based on repayment of interest accrued during the Deferral Period, interest accruing until and including the Maturity Date, and full amortization of the outstanding principal balance. The PPP loans are recorded as debt.
 
According to the terms of the PPP, all or a portion of loans under the PPP may be forgiven if certain conditions set forth in the CARES Act and the rules of the SBA are met.  In addition, each PPP Note includes events of default, the occurrence and continuation of which would provide the Lender with the right to exercise remedies against NSC or WEC, as applicable, including the right to declare the entire unpaid principal balance under the applicable PPP Note and all accrued unpaid interest immediately due.  There can be no assurance that the SBA will forgive all or any part of the PPP Loans, or that it will not assert that the conditions to obtaining such loans were met, in which case the PPP Loans could be subject to acceleration.
 
United Advisors Acquisition
 
On February 7, 2020, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “United Advisors Agreement” and the transactions contemplated thereunder, the “United Advisors Acquisition”) with United Atlantic Capital, LLC, a New Jersey limited liability company (“UAC”), Mark H. Penske (“MHP”) and Darin Pope (“DP” and together with UAC and MHP, the “Selling Parties”) to acquire all of the outstanding equity interests (collectively, the “Purchased Group Shares”) of Financial Services International Corporation, a Washington corporation (“FSIC”), United Advisor Services, LLC, a New Jersey limited liability company (“UAS”), and United Advisors, LLC, a New Jersey limited liability company (“UA” and collectively with FSIC and UAS, the “Group Companies”).
 
On September 11, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding equity interests of the Group Companies. Under the terms of the United Advisors Agreement, at the closing of the United Advisors Acquisition, the Company acquired the Purchased Group Shares for a closing payment of $3.0 million paid in cash. Under the Purchase Agreement, the Selling Parties are entitled to additional consideration of up to approximately $4.5 million paid in twelve equal quarterly installment payments in cash (the “Additional Cash Purchase Price”), subject to certain adjustments.
 
UA is a New York-based, advisor and wealth management firm. UAS is an SEC Registered Investment Advisor and FSIC is a FINRA registered broker-dealer. More than 25 financial professionals are part of the United Advisors team.
 
Winslow, Evans & Crocker, Inc. Acquisition
 
On August 26, 2019, the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement (as amended, the “Winslow Agreement” and the transactions contemplated thereunder, the “Winslow Acquisition”) whereby the Company agreed to acquire all of the outstanding equity interests (the “Purchased Winslow Shares”) of Winslow Evans & Crocker, Inc. (“WEC”), Winslow, Evans & Crocker Insurance Agency, Inc. (“WIA”), and Winslow Financial, Inc. (“WF” and collectively with WEC and WIA, the “Winslow Targets”). The Company entered into an amendment to the Winslow Agreement on October 11, 2019, to reflect certain clarifications to the terms of the Winslow Agreement as agreed to by the parties. 
 
On December 31, 2019, the Company completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding equity interests of the Winslow Targets.
 
   2

  

Under the terms of the Winslow Agreement, at the closing of the Winslow Acquisition, the Company acquired the Purchased Winslow Shares for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $3.2 million paid at closing in cash, subject to certain adjustments, plus additional consideration to be based on (i) the amount of net operating capital of WEC and WF as of the closing, payable in three annual installments and not to exceed $1.0 million in the aggregate, (ii) the aggregate pre-tax net income (loss) of the Winslow Targets through September 22, 2022, provided that such additional consideration shall not be less than $1.5 million and shall not exceed $3.0 million in the aggregate, and (iii) a portion of the synergies achieved through September 20, 2022. At the signing of the Winslow Agreement, the Company deposited $500,000 into escrow, which was applied to the amount payable at closing.
 
WEC is a Boston-based, full-service investment firm established in 1991. WEC is an SEC Registered Investment Advisor and a FINRA registered broker-dealer. More than 50 financial professionals including Certified Financial Planners, Investment Advisor Representatives, Financial Consultants, brokers and other specialists are part of the Winslow team. Located in the heart of the financial district in Boston, MA, the Company believes that WEC is a strategic location for the Company to build out its banking platform.
 
Clearing Relationships
 
NSC has clearing arrangements with National Financial Services LLC (“NFS”), Axos Clearing (“Axos”) formerly COR Clearing LLC, Raymond James (“RJ”) and Interactive Brokers LLC. WEC has clearing arrangements with RJ and Pershing LLC.
Financial Information about Industry Segments
 
The Company has two reportable segments: (i) the brokerage and advisory services segment, and (ii) the tax and accounting services segment. The brokerage and advisory services segment includes broker-dealer and investment advisory services, the sale of insurance products and licensed mortgage brokerage services provided by NSC, NAM, National Insurance, Prime Financial, GC, WEC, WIA and WF. The tax and accounting services segment includes tax preparation and accounting services provided by National Tax.
 
During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, we recognized approximately 74% and 73%, respectively, of our total revenues from brokerage services, principal and agency transactions, and investment banking. During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, (i) brokerage services consisting of retail brokerage commissions represented 51% and 41%, respectively, of total revenues, (ii) principal and agency transactions consisting of net dealer inventory gains (losses) represented 1% and (1)%, respectively, of total revenues, and (iii) investment banking consisting of corporate finance commissions and fees, represented 22% and 33%, respectively, of total revenues. For a more detailed analysis of our results by segment, see Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
 
Business Lines
 
Brokerage Services
 
NSC and WEC are each registered as broker-dealers with the SEC and licensed to conduct activities as a broker-dealer in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. NSC and WEC are also members of FINRA, MSRB and SIPC.
 
Registered representatives are given broad discretion to structure their own practices and specialize in different areas of the securities markets subject to supervisory procedures and applicable rules and regulations. In addition, registered representatives have direct access to research materials, our management, our traders, and all levels of our support personnel.
 
The brokerage services provided by our registered representatives and investment advisors include execution of purchases and sales of stocks, options, bonds, mutual funds, annuities and various other securities for individual and institutional customers. In the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, trades of stocks and options represented approximately 58% of our brokerage revenues, trades of bonds represented approximately 10% of our brokerage revenues, and trades of mutual funds, annuities and various other securities made up approximately 24% of our brokerage revenues. The percentage of each type of business varies over time as the investment preferences of our customers change based on market conditions.
 
Typically, NSC and WEC do not recommend particular securities to customers. Rather, recommendations to customers are determined by individual registered representatives based upon NSC and WEC’s research and analysis or their own research and analysis, subject to applicable FINRA customer suitability standards. Most registered representatives perform fundamental (as opposed to technical) analysis. Solicitations are made by telephone, email, seminars or newsletters.
 
NSC and WEC generally act as agents in executing customer orders to buy or sell listed and over-the-counter securities in which we do not make a market and charge commissions based on the services we provide to our customers. In executing customer orders to buy or sell a security in which we make a market, we may sell to, or purchase from, customers at a price that is substantially equal to the current inter-dealer market price plus or minus a mark-up or mark-down. We may also act as agent and execute a customer’s purchase or sale order with another broker-dealer market-maker at the best inter-dealer market price available and charge a commission. We believe our mark-ups, mark-downs and commissions are competitive based on various factors including the services we provide to our customers. The commissions and mark-ups or mark-downs must be in compliance with guidelines established by FINRA. In order to increase revenues generated from these activities, we continuously seek to hire additional registered representatives and work with our current registered representatives to increase their productivity.

Payments to both our independent and employee registered representatives are based on commissions generated and represent a variable cost rather than a fixed cost of operating our business. Commission expense represents a significant majority of our total expenses. We work to control our fixed costs in order to achieve operating profitability based upon our expectation of market conditions and the related level of revenues. Our operations include execution of orders, processing of transactions, internal financial controls, supervision and compliance with regulatory and legal requirements.
 
Historically, most of our registered representatives served as independent contractors responsible for providing their own office facilities, sales assistants, telephone, Internet, computer and other equipment, software, market data, supplies and other items of overhead. As of September 30, 2020, we had a total of approximately 1,010 associates of which 390 were employees and 620 were independent contractors. Of these associates, approximately 700 were registered representatives.
 
We believe that registered representatives in the brokerage industry are traditionally compensated on the basis of set percentages of total commissions and mark-ups generated. Most brokerage firms bear substantially all of the costs of maintaining their sales forces, including providing office space, sales assistants, telephone and Internet service, computers and other equipment and supplies. We believe that the average commission paid to employee registered representatives in the brokerage industry generally ranges from 30% to 50% of total commissions generated.
 
Since we require a majority of our registered representatives to absorb their own overhead and expenses, we pay a higher percentage of the commissions and mark-ups generated by our registered representatives, as compared to traditional registered representatives in the brokerage industry. This arrangement also reduces fixed costs and lowers the risk of operational losses for lower or non-producing brokers.
 
Our business plan includes the growth of our retail and institutional brokerage business, while recognizing the volatility of the financial markets. In response to historical market fluctuations, we have periodically adjusted certain business activities, including proprietary trading and market-making trading. We believe that consolidation within the industry may occur and we may consider strategic acquisitions in the future, but we are focused on generating positive cash flow and maintaining profitability of our current operations.
 
We conduct periodic reviews of our controls and our supervision, administrative and operations personnel meet frequently with our management to review operating conditions. Our compliance, supervision and operations personnel monitor compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations.
 
Broker-Dealer Trading
 
NSC and WEC buy and may maintain inventories in equity securities as “market-makers” for sale of those securities to other dealers and our customers. NSC and WEC may also maintain inventories in corporate, government and municipal debt securities for sale to our customers. The level of our market-making trading activities typically increases or decreases depending on the relative strength or weakness of the broader markets. As of September 30, 2020, we made markets in approximately 112 micro- and small-cap Nasdaq and other exchange-listed quoted stocks. We anticipate that we will continue market-making trading activity in the future, which may include securities of companies for which we participated as an underwriter for in a public offering of securities.
 
Our trading departments require a commitment of capital. Most principal transactions place our capital at risk. Profits and losses are dependent upon the skill of our traders, price movements, trading activity and the size of inventories. Since our trading activities occasionally may involve speculative and thinly capitalized stocks, including stabilizing the market for securities which we have underwritten, we impose position limits to reduce our potential for loss.
 
In executing customer orders to buy or sell a security in which we make a market, we may sell to, or purchase from, customers at a price that is substantially equal to the current inter-dealer market price plus or minus a mark-up or mark-down. We may also act as agent and execute a customer’s purchase or sale order with another broker-dealer market-maker at the best inter-dealer market price available and charge a commission. We believe our mark-ups, mark-downs and commissions are competitive based on various factors including the services we provide to our customers.
 
Investment Banking
 
We provide corporate finance and investment banking services, including underwriting the sale of securities to the public in both initial and follow-on offerings and arranging for the private placement of securities with investors. Our investment banking services require a short-term commitment of our capital. Our corporate finance operations provide a broad range of financial and corporate advisory services, including mergers and acquisitions, project financing, capital structure and specific financing opportunities. Corporate finance revenues are generated from capital raising transactions of equity and debt securities and fees for strategic advisory services. Recognizing the diversity of our clients, we plan to work closely with our independent advisors to identify key additional investment banking verticals that we can strengthen to enhance our offerings to our clients.

Investment Advisory Services
 
NAM, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and a SEC-registered investment advisor, offers advisory services described below to clients in various programs. Under such customized engagements, clients authorize NAM to purchase and sell securities on a discretionary or non-discretionary basis (depending on the program) pursuant to investment objectives chosen by the client. The client’s Investment Advisory Representative (“IAR”) obtains the essential facts from the client, and assists in determining the appropriate program. The IAR provides ongoing investment advice and management that is tailored to the individual needs of the client through a review of the investment profile and objectives of the client. Depending on the program selected and the client’s profile and objectives, the types of securities that may be purchased or sold include mutual funds, ETFs, equities, options, fixed income securities, structured notes and partnership interests in real estate, oil and gas, as well as management of variable annuity sub-accounts. Clients generally may impose reasonable restrictions on investing in certain securities or groups of securities.
 
NAM receives compensation from clients through assets under management fees, administrative fees, and in some instances, hourly fees, fixed fees, performance-based fees or carried interest. IARs receive a portion of the fees in accordance with their contract with NAM. A NAM IAR may also be a registered representative with NSC, a subsidiary of the Company and an affiliate of NAM, and therefore can establish and service brokerage accounts for NAM clients.
 
Programs currently offered by NAM include:
 

• | The Portfolio Advisor Program, pursuant to which the IAR manages individual client accounts on a discretionary basis, with an asset-based fee;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Portfolio Advisor Plus Program, in which the IAR manages individual client accounts on a discretionary basis, with an alternative pricing structure whereby qualified clients may pay a performance-based fee in addition to an asset-based fee;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Morningstar Managed Portfolios Program, a proprietary program offered through Morningstar Investment Services, Inc., consisting of multiple investment strategies with multiple portfolios intended for a range of clients based on such factors as age, financial situation, time horizon, risk tolerance and any reasonable restrictions that the client may place on the portfolio selected for the account. Fees in this program are asset-based;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Investment Advisor Program, pursuant to which IARs provide advisory services with respect to variable annuity products, plans such as 401(k)s, 403(b)s, mutual funds, and retirement funds, as well as individually managed client accounts. Fees in this program are asset-based;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Financial planning, offered for a flat fee or an hourly rate;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | Discretionary management services for private funds;

• | Retirement solutions provided to retirement plan providers, sponsors, and participants through various products, services and custodial platforms, including FOLIO Institutional, which is a custodian and financial technology firm;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Wrap programs, which are advisory programs in which advisory fees and execution fees are bundled, using a platform offered by Envestnet Asset Management, Inc., a SEC-registered investment adviser and “turnkey” asset management platform provider. The Envestnet platform provides wealth management technology for registered investment advisers along with asset management programs;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A unified managed account program (a unified managed account refers to an account that combines investment vehicles into a single or “unified” account managed by one or more independent money managers) using Foliofn Investments, Inc. Foliofn is a custodian that offers a fractionalized share trading platform which enables investors to diversify investments across multiple securities; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A program utilizing the FTJ FundChoice Program, in which NAM serves as the advisor for the client on a non-discretionary basis.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
NAM operates its programs as a directed brokerage subject to most favorable execution of client transactions. NAM does not require a client to utilize any particular broker/custodian and currently has relationships with a number of brokers/custodians that provide brokerage, clearing and custody services to clients in the programs. The choice of which broker/custodian to utilize is determined by the client in consultation with their IAR, and a client enters into a separate contractual relationship with the selected broker/custodian. Based on the client’s selection, all transactions in their accounts are then placed through the selected broker-dealer. NAM clients may pay ticket charges for brokerage services according to the agreement between the client and the selected custodian.
 
Clients may elect to use NSC as their broker-dealer for certain programs. NSC maintains a clearing arrangement with NFS to execute transactions at negotiated clearing rates. NSC receives a portion of ticket charges paid by NAM clients for trades executed through NSC. NAM does not receive any compensation for such brokerage services.
 
NAM may combine multiple orders for shares of the same securities purchased for advisory accounts. NAM then allocates a portion of the shares to participating accounts in a fair and equitable manner. NAM does this to obtain, to the extent possible, the optimal execution for clients. The distribution of the shares purchased is typically pro rata based on size of the orders placed for each account. It is not based on account performance or the amount or structure of management fees. When NAM IARs combine orders, each participating account pays an average price per share for all transactions and pays a proportionate share of all transaction costs. Accounts owned by associated IARs may participate in block trading with client accounts; however, they will receive an allocation only after all client orders are filled.

Institutional Services
 
A critical element of our business strategy is to identify institutional quality investments that offer above market returns. We support that mission by providing institutional investment managers, primarily hedge fund managers, a complete array of services designed to enhance portfolio performance. Hedge funds represent a segment of the money management market and by definition are focused on achieving positive returns for their investors while controlling risk. We offer fund managers access to investment opportunities and independent research products. Additionally, we offer fund managers the ability to reduce their transaction costs by offering them access to our trading desk for illiquid securities and automated trading systems for their liquid transactions as well as special execution services using volume weighted averages and average pricing for micro and small-cap stocks. We believe that our registered representatives engaged in institutional services have a mutually beneficial relationship with our Investment Banking Division (“IBD”), as fund managers looking for investment opportunities participate in offerings by IBD’s corporate clients. Our relationships with fund managers may create opportunities to increase the number and breadth of IBD clients.
Administration, Operations, Securities Transactions Processing and Customer Accounts
 
NSC and WEC do not hold any funds or securities for customers. Rather, they use the services of clearing agents on a fully-disclosed basis. These clearing agents process securities transactions and maintain customer accounts. In addition to transactions executed through our clearing agents, NSC and WEC also conduct direct business. Customer accounts are protected through SIPC for up to $500,000, of which coverage for cash balances is limited to $250,000. In addition to SIPC protection, NFS, our primary clearing agent, provides brokerage accounts additional “excess of SIPC” coverage from Lloyd’s of London, together with other insurers. The “excess of SIPC” coverage would only be used when SIPC coverage is exhausted. Like SIPC protection, “excess of SIPC” protection does not cover investment losses in customer accounts due to market fluctuations. It also does not cover other claims for losses incurred while the firms remain in business. Total aggregate “excess of SIPC” coverage available on all accounts held at NFS is $1.0 billion. Within the “excess of SIPC” coverage, there is no per account dollar limit on coverage of securities, just a per account limit of $1.9 million on coverage of cash.
Tax Preparation and Accounting Services
 
We provide tax preparation and small business accounting services through our wholly-owned subsidiary, National Tax. The tax preparation business is conducted predominantly during the period from February through April of each year. During the 2020 tax year season, National Tax prepared approximately 26,000 federal, state and local tax returns.
 
We believe that we offer clients a cost effective and proactive tax preparation and tax planning service. National Tax’s volume allows it to provide uniform services at competitive prices. In addition, as compared to certain of its competitors that are open only during tax season, all of National Tax’s offices are open year round to provide financial planning and other services to our clients.
 
National Tax's preparers are generally not certified public accountants, attorneys or enrolled agents. Therefore, they are limited in the representation that they can provide to clients in the event of an audit by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”).
 
Competition
 
We are engaged in a highly competitive business. With respect to one or more aspects of our business, our competitors include member organizations of the New York Stock Exchange and other registered securities exchanges in the United States and Canada, the U.K., Europe and members of FINRA. Many of these organizations have substantially greater personnel and financial resources and more sales offices than we do. Discount brokerage firms affiliated with commercial banks provide additional competition, as well as companies that provide electronic online trading. In many instances, the Company is also competing directly for customer funds with investment opportunities offered by the real estate, insurance, banking, and savings and loan industries.
 
The securities industry has become considerably more concentrated and competitive since we were founded, as numerous firms have either ceased operations or been acquired by or merged into other firms. In addition, companies not engaged primarily in the securities business, but with substantial financial resources, have acquired leading securities firms. These developments have increased competition from firms with greater capital resources than ours.
 
Since the adoption of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, commercial banks and thrift institutions have been able to engage in traditional brokerage and investment banking services, thus increasing competition in the securities industry and potentially increasing the rate of consolidation in the securities industry.
 
We also compete with other securities firms for successful sales representatives, securities traders and investment bankers. Competition for qualified employees and independent contractors in the financial services industry is intense. Our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and independent contractors and to retain and motivate our existing employees and independent contractors. For a further discussion of risks facing the Company, please see “Risk Factors.”
 
In addition, our tax preparation business is also subject to extensive competition. We compete with national tax return preparers such as H&R Block, Jackson Hewitt, and Liberty Tax. The remainder of the tax preparation industry is highly fragmented and includes regional tax preparation services, accountants, attorneys, small independently owned companies, and financial service institutions that prepare tax returns as ancillary parts of their business. To a lesser extent, we compete with the online and software self-preparer market.

Government Regulation and Supervision
 
NSC, WEC and our investment adviser businesses are subject to extensive regulation by the SEC, FINRA, MSRB, state securities regulators and other governmental regulatory authorities. The principal purpose of these regulations is the protection of customers and the securities markets. The SEC is the federal agency charged with the administration of the federal securities laws. Much of the regulation of broker-dealers, however, has been delegated to self-regulatory organizations (“SROs”), such as FINRA, that adopt rules, subject to approval by the SEC, which govern their members and conduct periodic examinations of member firms’ operations. Securities firms are also subject to regulation by state securities commissions in the states in which they are registered. NSC and WEC are registered broker-dealers with the SEC and members of FINRA. NSC and WEC are each licensed to conduct activities as a broker-dealer in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. A number of changes have been proposed to the rules and regulations that govern our securities business, and other rules and regulations have been adopted, which may result in changes in the way we conduct our business.
 
Broker-Dealer Regulation
 
As a result of federal and state registration and SRO memberships, broker-dealers are subject to overlapping schemes of regulation that cover all aspects of their securities businesses. Such regulations cover matters including capital requirements; uses and safekeeping of clients’ funds and securities; conduct of directors, officers, and employees; record keeping and reporting requirements; supervisory and organizational procedures intended to ensure compliance with securities laws and to prevent improper trading on material nonpublic information; employee-related matters, including qualification and licensing of supervisory, sales and other personnel; limitations on extensions of credit in securities transactions; clearance and settlement procedures; requirements for the registration, underwriting, sale, and distribution of securities; customer identification rules; rules related to the identification and reporting of suspicious activity; and rules of the SROs designed to promote high standards of commercial honor and just and equitable principles of trade. A particular focus of the applicable regulations concerns the relationship between broker-dealers and their customers. As a result, many aspects of the broker-dealer customer relationship are subject to regulation, including, in some instances, “suitability” determinations as to certain customer transactions, limitations on the amounts that may be charged to customers, timing of proprietary trading in relation to customers’ trades, and disclosures to customers.
 
Regulation NMS and Regulation SHO have substantially affected the trading of equity securities. These regulations were intended to increase transparency in the markets and have acted to further reduce spreads and, with competition from electronic marketplaces, to reduce commission rates paid by investors. The SEC recently enacted Regulation BI, which, among other things, establishes a new standard of conduct for broker-dealers when making a recommendation of a securities transaction or investment strategy involving securities to a retail customer. Broker-dealers must act in the “best interest” of the customer without placing their own financial or other interests ahead of the customer’s interest. Regulation BI requires a broker-dealer that is making a recommendation to comply with four obligations:  a disclosure obligation, a care obligation, a conflict of interest obligation, and a compliance obligation.
 
Additional legislation, changes in rules promulgated by the SEC and by SROs, and changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules often directly affect the method of operation and profitability of broker-dealers. The SEC and the SROs conduct regular examinations of our broker-dealer subsidiaries and also initiate targeted and other specific inquiries from time to time, which generally include the investigation of issues involving substantial portions of the securities industry. The SEC and the SROs may conduct administrative proceedings, and the SEC may initiate litigation in federal court, either of which can result in censures, fines, disgorgement, suspension, or expulsion of a broker-dealer, its officers, or employees. The principal purpose of regulation and discipline of broker-dealers is the protection of customers and the securities markets rather than the protection of creditors and stockholders of broker-dealers. The US Department of Justice and state criminal authorities may also investigate activities of broker-dealers and institute criminal or civil proceedings against broker-dealers for violations of applicable law.
 
NSC and WEC are subject to the Securities Investor Protection Act and are members of Securities Investors Protection Corporation (“SIPC”), whose primary function is to provide financial protection for the customers of failing brokerage firms. SIPC provides protection for customers up to $500,000, of which a maximum of $250,000 may be in cash.
 
Margin lending by NSC and WEC are subject to the margin rules of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and FINRA. Under such rules, NSC and WEC are limited in the amount each may lend in connection with certain purchases of securities and are also required to impose certain maintenance requirements on the amount of securities and cash held in margin accounts. In addition, NSC and WEC may impose more restrictive margin requirements than required by such rules.
 
Net Capital Rule
 
In addition, as a registered broker-dealer and a member of FINRA, NSC, WEC and FSIC are subject to the SEC’s Uniform Net Capital Rule 15c3-1 (the “Net Capital Rule”), which is designed to measure the general financial integrity and liquidity of a broker-dealer and requires, among other things, the maintenance of minimum net capital. Net capital is defined as the net worth of a broker-dealer subject to certain adjustments that exclude assets not readily convertible into cash. Additionally, the regulations require that certain assets, such as a broker-dealer’s position in securities, be valued in a conservative manner so as to avoid overstating of the broker-dealer’s net capital.
 
In February 2015, pursuant to a directive from FINRA, NSC reverted back to using the alternative method of computing net capital from the aggregate indebtedness method. At September 30, 2020, NSC had net capital of $3,812,891, which was $2,812,891 in excess of its required minimum net capital of $1,000,000, WEC had net capital of $467,947 which was $305,992 in excess of its required minimum net capital of $161,955, and FSIC had net capital of $117,538 which was $112,538 in excess of its required minimum net capital of $5,000. WEC’s ratio of aggregate indebtedness to net capital was 5.2 to 1, and FSIC's ratio of aggregate indebtedness to net capital was 0.2 to 1.
 
NSC, WEC and FSIC are exempt from the provisions of the SEC’s Customer Protection Rule 15c3-3 (the “Customer Protection Rule”), since they are introducing broker-dealers that clear all transactions on a fully disclosed basis and promptly transmit all customer funds and securities to clearing brokers.

Tax Preparation
 
Our tax preparation business is also subject to extensive regulation. Federal legislation requires income tax return preparers to, among other things, register as a tax preparer, set forth their signatures and identification numbers on all tax returns prepared by them, and retain all tax returns prepared by them for three years. Federal laws also subject income tax preparers to accuracy-related penalties in connection with the preparation of income tax returns. Preparers may be prohibited from further acting as income tax return preparers if they continuously and repeatedly engage in specified misconduct. In addition, authorized IRS e-filer providers are required to comply with certain rules and regulations, as per IRS Publication 1345 and other notices of the IRS applicable to e-filing.
 
IRS regulations require among other things, that all tax return preparers use a Preparer Tax Identification Number (“PTIN”) as their identifying number on federal tax returns filed after December 31, 2010, to be authorized to practice before the IRS. As a prerequisite to obtaining or renewing a PTIN, the PTIN applicants allow the IRS to conduct tax compliance checks and identify the individuals who are considered “tax return preparers”. The IRS also conducts background checks on PTIN applicants.
 
Other Regulations
 
We are also subject to the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the “Patriot Act”), which imposes obligations regarding the prevention and detection of money-laundering activities, including the establishment of customer due diligence, customer verification and other compliance policies and procedures. The conduct of research analysts is also the subject of rule-making by the SEC, FINRA, and the federal government through the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. These regulations require certain disclosures by, and restrict the activities of, research analysts and broker-dealers, among others. Failure to comply with these requirements may result in monetary, regulatory and, in the case of the USA Patriot Act, criminal penalties.
 
Our asset management subsidiaries, NAM, WEC and WF are SEC-registered investment advisers and are accordingly subject to regulation by the SEC. Requirements under the Investment Advisors Act of 1940 include record-keeping, advertising and operating requirements, as well as prohibitions on fraudulent activities.
 
Various regulators, including the SEC, FINRA and state securities regulators and attorneys general, are conducting both targeted and industry-wide investigations of certain practices relating to the financial services industry, including marketing, sales practices, valuation practices, asset managers, and market and compensation arrangements. These investigations have involved mutual fund companies, broker-dealers, hedge funds, investors and others.
 
In addition, the SEC staff has conducted studies with respect to soft dollar practices in the brokerage and asset management industries and proposed interpretive guidance regarding the scope of permitted brokerage and research services in connection with soft dollar practices.
 
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and related Federal Trade Commission regulations require us to adopt and disclose customer privacy policies.
 
Application of Laws and Rules to Internet Business and Other Online Services
 
Due to the increasing popularity and use of the Internet and other online services, various regulatory authorities are considering laws and/or regulations with respect to the Internet or other online services covering issues such as user privacy, pricing, content copyrights and quality of services. In addition, the growth and development of the market for online commerce may prompt more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on those companies conducting business online. When the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), were enacted, such acts did not contemplate the conduct of a securities business through the Internet and other online services. The recent increase in the number of complaints by online traders could lead to more stringent regulations of online trading firms and their practices by the SEC, FINRA and other regulatory agencies.
 
Although the SEC, in releases and no-action letters, has provided guidance on various issues related to the offer and sale of securities and the conduct of a securities business through the Internet, the application of the laws to the conduct of a securities business through the Internet continues to evolve. Furthermore, the applicability to the Internet and other online services of existing laws in various jurisdictions governing issues such as property ownership, sales and other taxes and personal privacy is uncertain and may take years to resolve. Uncertainty regarding these issues may adversely affect the viability and profitability of our business.
 
As our services through our subsidiaries are available over the Internet in multiple jurisdictions and we have numerous clients residing in these jurisdictions, these jurisdictions may claim that our subsidiaries are required to qualify to do business as a foreign corporation in each such jurisdiction. While NSC and WEC are currently registered as broker-dealers in the jurisdictions described in this report, all of our subsidiaries are qualified to do business as corporations in only a few international jurisdictions. Failure to qualify as an out-of-state or foreign corporation in a jurisdiction where we are required to do so could subject us to taxes and penalties for the failure to qualify.

Seasonality and Backlog
 
Other than our tax preparation business, we are not subject to significant seasonal fluctuations, and there are no material backlogs in our business. Because most tax returns are filed during the period from February through April of each year, most revenues from our tax preparation and related services and products will be earned during this period.
Research and Development and Environmental Matters
 
We did not incur any research and development expenses during the last three fiscal years. We do not incur any significant costs or experience any significant effects as a result of compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws.
