ITEM 1. Business
General Overview
On January 26, 2023, we changed our corporate name from Blucora, Inc. to Avantax, Inc. We will not distinguish between our prior and current corporate name and will refer to our current corporate name throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Avantax, Inc., a Delaware corporation formerly known as Blucora, Inc. (the “Company,” “Avantax,” “we,” “our,” or “us”), is a leading provider of integrated tax-focused wealth management services and platforms, assisting consumers, small business owners, tax professionals, financial professionals, and certified public accounting (“CPA”) firms. Our mission is to enable financial success by changing the way individuals and families plan and achieve their goals through tax-advantaged solutions. Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “AVTA.” Our integrated tax-focused wealth management services consist of the operations of Avantax Wealth Management and Avantax Planning Partners.
Avantax Wealth Management provides tax-focused wealth management solutions for financial professionals, tax professionals, CPA firms, and their clients. Avantax Wealth Management offers its services through its registered broker-dealer, registered investment advisor (“RIA”), and insurance agency subsidiaries and is a leading U.S. tax-focused independent broker-dealer. Avantax Wealth Management works with a nationwide network of financial professionals that operate as independent contractors. Avantax Wealth Management provides these financial professionals with an integrated platform of technical, practice, compliance, operations, sales, and product support tools that enable them to offer tax-advantaged planning, investing, and wealth management services to their clients.
Avantax Planning Partners is an in-house/employee-based RIA, insurance agency, and wealth management business that partners with CPA firms in order to provide their consumer and small business clients with holistic financial planning and advisory services, as well as retirement plan solutions through Avantax Retirement Plan Services. Avantax Planning Partners formerly operated as Honkamp Krueger Financial Services, Inc. (“HKFS”). We acquired HKFS in July 2020 (the “HKFS Acquisition”) and subsequently rebranded it in order to create tighter brand alignment through one common and recognizable brand. Any reference to Avantax Planning Partners in this Form 10-K is inclusive of HKFS.
As of December 31, 2022, we worked with a nationwide network of 3,109 financial professionals and supported $76.9 billion of total client assets, including $38.3 billion of advisory assets.
Divestiture of Tax Software Business
On October 31, 2022, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with TaxAct Holdings, Inc. (f/k/a Avantax Holdings, Inc.), a Delaware corporation and a direct subsidiary of Blucora, Inc., Franklin Cedar Bidco, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “Buyer”), and, solely for purposes of certain provisions thereof, DS Admiral Bidco, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, pursuant to which agreed to sell our tax software business to Buyer for an aggregate purchase price of $720.0 million in cash, subject to customary purchase price adjustments set forth in the Purchase Agreement (the “TaxAct Sale”). This transaction subsequently closed on December 19, 2022. In connection with the TaxAct Sale, we entered into a Transition Services Agreement with Buyer pursuant to which each party will provide the other with certain transition services for an initial period ending on June 19, 2023 with optional subsequent renewal periods. This transaction allowed us to become a pure-play wealth management company.
Business Overview
We have one reportable segment, which consists of the operations of Avantax Wealth Management and Avantax Planning Partners. We believe these two models provide unique and complementary models through which tax and financial professionals can affiliate with us. These models include:
•an independent model where financial professionals can serve their clients’ wealth management needs directly or where tax professionals and CPAs can partner or affiliate with one of our independent financial professionals to provide their clients tax-advantaged financial solutions; and
•an in-house/employee-based RIA model where CPAs and tax professionals can outsource their clients’ wealth management needs to one of our employee financial professionals.
Avantax, Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K 


Flexible affiliation models are core to our value proposition to be the leader serving a community of CPAs, tax professionals, and tax-focused financial professionals by providing clients tax-advantaged investment solutions, innovative technologies, and tax-inclusive financial planning. These complementary affiliation models offer powerful ways for us to partner with CPAs and tax professionals of all sizes, from sole practitioners to multi-partner CPA firms.
Avantax Wealth Management. Through its registered broker-dealer, RIA, and insurance agency subsidiaries, Avantax Wealth Management provides tax-focused wealth management solutions to financial professionals, tax professionals, CPA firms, and their clients nationwide and operates a leading U.S. tax-focused independent broker-dealer.
Avantax Wealth Management works with a nationwide network of financial professionals that operate as independent contractors. Because Avantax Wealth Management primarily recruits and serves independent tax professionals, CPA firms, and financial professionals who partner with established tax practices, most Avantax Wealth Management financial professionals have long-standing tax advisory relationships that anchor their wealth management businesses. This contrasts with traditional independent broker-dealers and investment advisers who are typically limited to providing investment advice to their clients.
We believe that tax and accounting professionals, with their existing client relationships and in-depth knowledge of their clients’ financial situations, are well positioned to grow their wealth management practices as their tax advisory relationships provide a large base of potential clients. This competitive advantage results in an experienced and stable network of financial professionals who are uniquely positioned to provide tailored and comprehensive financial solutions that enable clients to meet their financial goals, including their tax and wealth management goals. In turn, our financial professionals have multiple revenue-generating options to diversify their earnings sources.
To help tax and accounting professionals integrate wealth management services into their practices, we offer specialized training and support that introduces these financial professionals to the investment business and helps them build their practices. We administer comprehensive training curriculum through a multi-medium approach, including an annual national sales conference, numerous advisor- and home-office led training events, regional meetings, and on-demand learning resources.
Once financial professionals have integrated wealth management into their practices, Avantax Wealth Management provides an open-architecture investment platform and technology tools to help financial professionals identify investment opportunities for their clients. In addition, Avantax Wealth Management supports its financial professionals through its proprietary software tools that are designed to help financial professionals systematically capture tax-alpha (i.e., the incremental performance an investor can achieve, relative to market returns, by taking advantage of available tax-saving strategies) for clients by identifying tax savings opportunities in a financial professional’s client base and automating the capture of that opportunity. Our ongoing investments in technology and data analytics are designed to drive enhanced experiences for financial professionals and their clients, and in turn, grow client assets over time.
Avantax Wealth Management also has a highly experienced home office team that is focused on developing and delivering solutions tailored to each financial professional’s practice. The home office team provides marketing, practice management, product support, investment management, planning, portfolio management, investment selection, retirement services, compliance, business consulting, succession planning, and other support to our financial professionals.
Avantax Planning Partners. As a tax-focused captive RIA, Avantax Planning Partners’ financial professionals are our employees who partner with CPA firms across the country to provide tax-advantaged planning, investing, and financial solutions for their clients. Avantax Planning Partners recruits and builds relationships with CPA firms that desire to provide their clients with tax-advantaged wealth management solutions and financial plans but prefer to outsource that service to a trusted expert.
By the nature of the business, CPAs develop deep, long-lasting relationships with their clients and have insight into their tax and wealth management needs. The trust built in these long-standing relationships provides a solid foundation to recommend a client to a trusted Avantax Planning Partners in-house financial professional who can provide comprehensive wealth management services.
Avantax, Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K 


Holistic financial planning is the core offering of Avantax Planning Partners. In-house financial professionals provide guidance in asset management, retirement planning, advanced planning (including, among other things, business succession planning and estate planning), strategic tax and income planning, and insurance. 
To assist affiliate CPA firms with integrating wealth management services into their practice, Avantax Planning Partners offers specialized training and support that introduces CPAs to the investment business and identifies the CPA firms’ top potential clients. CPAs then work directly with in-house financial professionals to refer clients and provide wealth management solutions.
Avantax Wealth Management and Avantax Planning Partners primarily generate revenue through securities and insurance commissions, quarterly investment advisory fees based on advisory assets, product marketing service agreements, retirement plan servicing fees, and other agreements and fees. For additional information on the Wealth Management segment’s revenues, see “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 2.” 
Our History
We were formed in 1996 as a Delaware corporation. Significant recent events in our history include:
•In January 2012, we acquired TaxAct, a provider of digital tax preparation solutions.
•In December 2015, we acquired HDV Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“HD Vest”), a provider of wealth management and advisory solutions specifically for tax professionals, and announced our plans to focus on the technology-enabled financial solutions market.
•On May 6, 2019, we closed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding common stock of 1st Global, Inc. and 1st Global Insurance Services, Inc. (together, “1st Global”), a tax-focused wealth management company (the “1st Global Acquisition”). The 1st Global Acquisition was strategically important as it expanded our presence as a leading tax-focused independent broker-dealer while also providing the scale to compete more broadly in the wealth management market. 
•On July 1, 2020, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding common stock of HKFS. The HKFS Acquisition enabled us to expand the ways we can work with CPA firms and tax professionals to deliver wealth management services to clients, increase our addressable market, and enhance our growth opportunities. Since this acquisition, we have significantly expanded our RIA model into the West Coast, the Northeast, the Southeast, and Texas, completing a total of 20 acquisitions. 
•On January 4, 2021, we announced the rebranding of HKFS to Avantax Planning Partners. This rebranding was designed to create tighter brand alignment, bringing our business under one common and recognizable brand.
•On December 19, 2022, we closed the sale of our tax software business, TaxAct, for an aggregate purchase price of $720 million in cash, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. This transaction allows us to become a pure-play wealth management company, focusing on providing tax-focused wealth management through our independent broker dealer, Avantax Wealth Management, and our employee-based registered investment advisor, Avantax Planning Partners. 
•On January 26, 2023, we changed our corporate name from Blucora, Inc. to Avantax, Inc. 
Industry Trends
In the wealth management industry, we believe that we are benefiting and will continue to benefit from several positive industry trends, including growth of investable assets, a continued migration to independent financial professional channels, and a continued shift toward household use of fee-based financial professionals. In addition, the captive or employee-based RIA market segment, in which Avantax Planning Partners belongs, is the fastest-growing market segment within the wealth management industry.
Growth Strategy
Our growth strategy begins with our purpose to enable clients to achieve their goals by providing holistic financial services through a uniquely tax-focused lens. Historically, the wealth management industry has largely failed to focus on the impacts of taxes, or only executed tax-advantaged strategies for the wealthiest segment of clients, ignoring the tax ramifications for a broad range of clients. We seek to execute holistic, long-term tax minimization strategies for our clients’ tax situations, while expanding access to those strategies to a broader group 
Avantax, Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K 


of individuals and families. We are confident this approach will drive better outcomes for our financial professionals, leading to higher client acquisition, greater client lifetime value, and better client retention. 
Our primary growth strategy focuses on accelerating organic growth in the tax-focused wealth management space by:
▪enhancing our financial professional experience with continued investment in service quality and team training to deliver superior capabilities;
▪driving client acquisition by targeted recruiting of newly licensed tax professionals, established tax-focused financial professionals, and CPA accounting firms looking to serve their clients with wealth management;
▪continuing to develop compelling options for financial professionals interested in succession planning for their firms;
▪when in the clients’ best interest, improving asset retention and monetization through the continued shift of assets into advisory accounts through appropriate coaching, tools, training, and programs;
▪continuing to invest in our technology, products, and value-added services to create positive experiences for our financial professionals and their clients;
▪leveraging software development capabilities to improve the service and performance of products offered to our financial professionals;
▪expanding our product and service offerings for our financial professionals utilizing best practices. This includes expanding our turn-key retirement planning solutions business to a nationwide footprint through Avantax Planning Partners; and
▪improving the tools needed to make our financial professionals more productive by leveraging product and technology resources
Competition
The wealth management industry is a highly competitive and fragmented global industry. We and the financial professionals with whom we partner compete directly with a variety of financial institutions, including traditional wirehouses, independent broker-dealers, registered investment advisers (including CPA firms that have their own in-house registered investment advisors), asset managers, banks and insurance companies, direct distributors, larger broker-dealers, and robo-advisors. These competitors may have greater financial, technological, and marketing resources, broader infrastructure and distribution networks, greater brand recognition, and broader product and service offerings than us and may offer services at a lower fee than we do. We compete directly with these financial institutions for the provision of products and services to clients, as well as for recruitment and retention of financial professionals. 
We believe that our competitive position in the wealth management industry is a function of providing effective, differentiated service and tools to tax professionals, while understanding the needs of these tax professionals with respect to wealth management, in order to maximize the opportunity to provide tax-advantaged financial planning and advice to clients. We believe that our competitive advantage is centered on the following differentiators:
•We design our financial planning and advisory service for all taxpayers, not just ultra-high net worth taxpayers.
•We target tax professionals interested in wealth management and tax-advantaged financial professionals with two different affiliation models, which include:
▪an independent model where financial professionals can serve their clients’ wealth management needs directly or where tax professionals and CPAs can partner or affiliate with one of our independent financial professionals to provide their clients tax-advantaged financial solutions; and
▪an in-house/employee-based RIA model where CPAs and tax professionals can outsource their clients’ wealth management needs to one of our employee financial professionals.
•We support, nurture, and grow the largest community of tax professionals in the wealth management industry through training, growth communities, coaching programs, and purpose driven events.
•We provide best in class and personalized services and support to our tax-focused financial professionals through operations, service, and relationship management teams.

•We offer and continuously develop investment solutions, growth strategies, practice management, and digital product capabilities to deliver tax advantaged opportunities to our community of financial professionals.
Governmental Regulation
Avantax is a publicly traded company that is subject to SEC and NASDAQ Global Select Market rules and regulations regarding public disclosure, financial reporting, internal controls, and corporate governance. We are subject to federal and state government requirements, including regulations related to broker-dealers, securities, investment advisers, asset management, insurance, taxation, intellectual property, labor, advertising, listing standards, product and services quality, consumer protection, user privacy, security, and pricing.
We are subject to enhanced regulatory scrutiny and are heavily regulated by multiple agencies, including the SEC, FINRA, state securities and insurance regulators, and other regulatory authorities. Our subsidiary, Avantax Investment Services, Inc., is a broker-dealer registered with the SEC, a member of FINRA, and a member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation and the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation. Broker-dealers and their representatives are subject to laws, rules, and regulations covering all aspects of the securities business, such as sales and trading practices, use and safekeeping of clients’ funds and securities, capital adequacy, supervision, recordkeeping and reporting, the conduct of directors, officers, and employees, general anti-fraud provisions, and Regulation Best Interest (which requires a broker-dealer to make recommendations without putting its financial interests ahead of the interests of a retail client). Broker-dealers and their representatives are also regulated by state securities administrators in those jurisdictions where they do business. Compliance with many of the laws, rules, and regulations applicable to us involves a number of risks, because laws, rules, and regulations frequently change and are subject to varying interpretations, among other reasons. Regulators make periodic examinations of our broker-dealer operations and review annual, monthly, and other reports and filings on our operations and financial condition. Violations of laws, rules, and regulations governing a broker-dealer’s actions could result in censure, penalties and fines, disgorgement of certain profits, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders, the restriction, suspension, or expulsion from the securities industry of such broker-dealer, its representatives or its officers or employees, or other similar adverse consequences.
Our subsidiaries, Avantax Advisory Services, Inc. and Avantax Planning Partners, Inc., are registered with the SEC as investment advisers and are subject to the requirements of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Advisers Act”), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Such requirements relate to, among other things, fiduciary duties to clients, advisory fees, maintaining an effective compliance program, solicitation arrangements, conflicts of interest, advertising, limitations on agency cross and principal transactions between the adviser and advisory clients, recordkeeping and reporting requirements, disclosure requirements, and general anti-fraud provisions. The SEC periodically examines our investment adviser operations and reviews annual and other reports and filings on our operations and disclosures. The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Advisers Act and other federal securities laws, ranging from fines, penalties, and censure to disgorgement of certain profits and suspension or termination of an investment adviser’s registration. Investment adviser representatives also are subject to certain state securities laws and regulations. Failure to comply with the Advisers Act or other federal and state securities laws and regulations could result in investigations, sanctions, profit disgorgement, issuance of cease-and-desist orders and bars, fines, or other similar adverse consequences.
Our subsidiaries offer certain products and services subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), and Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and to regulations promulgated under ERISA or the Code, insofar as they provide services with respect to plan clients, or otherwise deal with plan clients that are subject to ERISA or the Code. ERISA imposes certain duties on persons who are “fiduciaries” (as defined in Section 3(21) of ERISA) and prohibits certain transactions involving plans subject to ERISA and fiduciaries or other service providers to such plans. Non-compliance with these provisions may expose an ERISA fiduciary or other service provider to liability under ERISA, which may include monetary penalties as well as equitable remedies for the affected plan. Section 4975 of the Code prohibits certain transactions involving plans (as defined in Section 4975(e)(1) of the Code, which includes individual retirement accounts and Keogh plans) and service providers, including fiduciaries, to such plans. Section 4975 of the Code imposes excise taxes for violations of these prohibitions. 
Our subsidiaries, Avantax Insurance Agency LLC, Avantax Insurance Services, Inc., and Avantax Planning Partners, Inc., are insurance agencies licensed with the state licensing authority in the jurisdictions where they do business. Insurance agencies and their agents are subject to laws, rules, and regulations covering all aspects of the 
Avantax, Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K 


insurance business, including sales practices, use and safekeeping of clients’ funds, recordkeeping and reporting, the conduct of directors, officers, and employees, and general anti-fraud provisions. Insurance agencies and their agents are regulated by state insurance administrators in those jurisdictions where they do business. Compliance with many of the laws, rules, and regulations applicable to us involves a number of risks, because laws, rules, and regulations frequently change and are subject to varying interpretations, among other reasons. Violations of laws, rules, and regulations governing an insurance agency’s actions could result in censure, penalties, and fines, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders, the restriction, suspension, or expulsion of the agency or its agent or its officers or employees, from the insurance industry of a jurisdiction where they do business, or other similar adverse consequences.
We are subject to federal and state laws and government regulations concerning employee safety and health and environmental matters. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, and other federal and state agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that may have an impact on our operations.
See the section entitled “Legal and Regulatory Risks” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding governmental regulation of our business and risks related to such regulation.
Privacy and Security of Client Information and Transactions
Regulatory activity in the areas of privacy and data protection continues to grow worldwide, driven in part by the growth of technology and related concerns about the rapid and widespread dissemination and use of information. To the extent they are applicable to us, we must comply with various federal, state, and international laws and regulations and to financial institution and healthcare provider regulatory requirements relating to the privacy and security of the personal information of our clients and employees. In the United States, these include rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the Federal Trade Commission, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, federal and state labor and employment laws, state data breach notification laws, state privacy laws such as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, the Colorado Privacy Act, the Virginia Consumer Data Privacy Act, the New York Stop Hacks and Improve Electronic Data Security (SHIELD) Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, SEC Regulation S-P, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, as amended, and Regulation S-ID, and further potential federal and state requirements.
Many of these laws and regulations provide consumers and employees with a private right of action if a covered company suffers a data breach related to a failure to implement reasonable data security measures. In addition, we are subject to other privacy laws and regulations that apply to internet advertising, online behavioral tracking, mobile applications, SMS messaging, telemarketing, email communication, data hosting, data retention, financial and health information, and credit reporting. The legal framework around privacy issues is rapidly evolving, as various federal and state government bodies are considering adopting new privacy laws and regulations, which could result in significant limitations on or changes to the ways in which we can collect, use, host, store, or transmit the personal information and other data of our clients or employees. These laws could also affect the ways we communicate with our clients and deliver products and services and could significantly increase our compliance costs. As our business expands to new industry segments or otherwise becomes subject to rules and regulations of jurisdictions outside the United States with stricter data protection regimes, such as the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation, our compliance requirements and costs will increase. 
Through a privacy policy framework designed to be consistent with the principles of individual consent, data subject access, and privacy-by-design, we strive to help ensure that clients and employees are aware of, and can control, how we use personal information about them. We also use privacy statements to provide notice to clients of our privacy practices, as well as provide them the opportunity to furnish instructions with respect to use of their personal information. We participate in industry groups whose purpose is to develop or shape industry best practices, and to influence public policy, for privacy and security of data.
To address data security concerns, we use industry-standard data security safeguards to help protect our computer systems and the information clients give to us from loss, misuse, and unauthorized alteration. We work to protect our computer systems from unauthorized internal or external access using commercially-available computer security products as well as internally-developed security procedures and practices.
See the section entitled “Risks Related to Our Business” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding risks related to privacy and security of client information and transactions.
Avantax, Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K 


Intellectual Property
Our success is bolstered by our technology and intellectual property rights. We seek to protect such rights and the value of our corporate brands and reputation through a variety of measures, including: domain name registrations, confidentiality and intellectual property assignment agreements with employees and third parties, protective contractual provisions, and laws regarding copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets. We hold multiple registered trademarks in the United States and in various foreign countries, and we may apply for additional trademarks as business needs require. See the section entitled “Risks Related to Our Business” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding protecting and enforcing intellectual property rights and defending third-party infringement claims.
Human Capital
We are intensely focused on our financial professionals and their clients, as well as our people, who are our most valuable resource. We strive to attract, develop, and retain the most talented employees by providing programs and services that engage employees, help them to learn and develop, and empower them to enable our business strategies. We believe that a key component of our future success will leverage our continued ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. 
•As of December 31, 2022, we had 727 full-time employees.
•We offer competitive compensation and benefits that support our employees’ health and financial and emotional well-being.
•Our employee engagement, which is the percentage of employees who respond to the Company’s culture survey with a positive response to certain satisfaction metrics, continued to climb, increasing 9.8% from 2021 to 2022. 
•In 2022, more than 96% of our employees participated in development training through Udemy for Business, a digital learning platform, with an average of 4.5 training hours per participating employee.
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. Diversity serves as an integral component of our human capital objectives, and we seek to promote an inclusive work environment that represents a broad spectrum of backgrounds and cultures. As of December 31, 2022, 46% of our employee base, including 35% of our senior leadership team, was female, and 31% of our employee base was comprised of individuals with ethnically or racially diverse backgrounds. Furthermore, as of December 31, 2022, 45% of the members of our Board of Directors were female, and 27% were ethnically and racially diverse. Our Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Council (“DE&I Council”), established in 2020, continues to actively contribute to our diversity, equity, and inclusion strategy and initiatives. The DE&I Council is sponsored by two members of our executive leadership team and provides regular updates on diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives to the Compensation Committee. The DE&I Council has rolled out several internal initiatives, including: a mentoring program, educational and inclusivity newsletters, round table discussions with special guests, cultural focused celebrations, and diversity and inclusion focused engagements.
Utilization of Independent Contractors and Referring Representatives. We distributed our products and services and generated a substantial portion of our revenues through a nationwide network of 3,109 financial professionals as of December 31, 2022. Of these 3,109 financial professionals, 3,073 either: (1) partner with Avantax Wealth Management and operate as independent contractors or (2) partner with Avantax Planning Partners and operate as licensed referring representatives. We believe that our ability to attract, retain, support, and compensate these independent financial professionals and licensed referring representatives will continue to contribute to the growth and success of the Company overall.
We believe that retaining our strong employee team and the continued evolution of our culture will accelerate our business transformation as a stand-alone pure-play wealth management company.
