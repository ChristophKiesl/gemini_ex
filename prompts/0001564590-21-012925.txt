 Aspen Aerogels, Inc. is an aerogel technology company that designs, develops and manufactures innovative, high-performance aerogel insulation used primarily in the energy infrastructure and building materials markets. The Company has also developed a high-potential line of aerogel thermal barriers that enable solutions to thermal runaway challenges in lithium-ion batteries used in the electric vehicle market. In addition, the Company conducts research and development related to aerogel technology supported by funding from several agencies of the U.S. government and other institutions. The Company has decided to cease efforts to secure additional funded research contracts and to wind down existing contract research activities. When used in this report, the terms “we,” “us,” “our” and “the Company” refer to Aspen Aerogels, Inc. and its subsidiaries.
 We design, develop and manufacture innovative, high-performance aerogel insulation used primarily in the energy infrastructure and building materials markets. We believe our aerogel blankets deliver the best thermal performance of any widely used insulation product available on the market today and provide a combination of performance attributes unmatched by traditional insulation materials. Our end-use customers select our products where thermal performance is critical and to save money, improve resource efficiency, enhance sustainability, preserve operating assets and protect workers.
 Our technologically advanced insulation products are targeted at the estimated $3.1 billion annual global market for energy infrastructure insulation materials. Our aerogel insulation has undergone rigorous technical validation and is used by many of the world’s largest oil producers and the owners and operators of refineries, petrochemical plants, liquefied natural gas facilities and power generating and distribution assets, such as ExxonMobil, Reliance Industries, PTT LNG, and Royal Dutch Shell. Our products replace traditional insulation in existing facilities during regular maintenance, upgrades and capacity expansions. In addition, our aerogel products are increasingly being specified for use in new-build energy infrastructure facilities.
 We introduced our two key aerogel insulation product lines for the energy infrastructure market, Pyrogel and Cryogel, in 2008. Pyrogel and Cryogel have undergone rigorous technical validation by industry leading end-users and achieved significant market adoption. Our product revenue has grown from $17.2 million in 2008 to $99.8 million in 2020, representing a twelve-year compound annual growth rate of 16%. During this period, we have sold nearly $1.1 billion of our products globally, representing an installed base of more than 382 million square feet of insulation. We believe that our twelve-year track record of success positions us for future growth and continued gain in market share in the energy infrastructure market.
 We have grown our business by forming technical and commercial relationships with industry leaders, which has allowed us to optimize our products to meet the particular demands of targeted market sectors. We have benefited from our technical and commercial relationships with ExxonMobil in the oil refinery and petrochemical sector, with TechnipFMC in the offshore oil sector and with BASF in the building materials market. We will continue our strategy of working with innovative companies to target and penetrate additional opportunities in the energy infrastructure and building materials markets.
 We are also actively developing a number of promising aerogel products and technologies for the electric vehicle market. We have developed and are commercializing our proprietary line of PyroThin thermal barriers for use in lithium-ion batteries in electric vehicles. Our PyroThin product is an ultra-thin, lightweight and flexible thermal barrier engineered to meet the safety and performance demands of electric vehicle manufacturers. These thermal barriers are designed to impede the propagation of thermal runaway both at the battery cell and battery pack levels across multiple lithium-ion battery system architectures. Our technology offers a unique combination of performance attributes that enable electric vehicle manufacturers to achieve critical safety goals without sacrificing driving range.
In addition, we are seeking to leverage our patented carbon aerogel technology to develop industry-leading battery materials for lithium-ion battery systems in electric vehicles. These silicon-rich, carbon aerogel materials have the potential for use as a drop-in replacement for graphite in the anode of lithium-ion batteries to enable an increase in the drive range of electric vehicles.
 The commercial potential for our PyroThin products and carbon aerogel materials in the electric vehicle market is significant and is likely to require us to hire additional personnel, incur additional operating expenses and incur capital expenditures to expand our manufacturing capacity, build an automated fabrication operation, and meet automotive quality system requirements, among other items.
 We also derive product revenue from the building materials and other end markets. Customers in these markets use our products for applications as diverse as wall systems, military and commercial aircraft, trains, buses, appliances, apparel, footwear and outdoor gear. As we continue to enhance our aerogel technology platform, we believe we will have additional opportunities to address high value applications in the global insulation market, the electric vehicle market and in a number of new, high-value markets.

Our patented aerogel products and manufacturing technologies are significant assets. Silica aerogels are complex structures in which 97% of the volume consists of air trapped between intertwined clusters of amorphous silica solids. These extremely low-density solids provide superior thermal and acoustic insulating properties. Although silica aerogels are usually fragile materials, we have developed innovative and proprietary manufacturing processes that enable us to produce industrially robust aerogel insulation cost-effectively and at commercial scale. Our electrically conductive carbon aerogel materials are reaching development maturity, expanding our market opportunities in energy storage, filtration, water purification, and gas sorption. These patented carbon aerogels are uniquely strong, providing the physical strength, charge and ion conductivity, and porosity required to host high concentrations of silicon in lithium-ion battery anodes. These silicon carbon aerogels have the potential to lower the costs and increase the energy density of electric vehicle battery systems.
 Our insulation products help customers to improve the resource efficiency and sustainability of their operations. These products enable compact system design, reduce installation time and costs, promote freight and logistics cost savings, reduce system weight, minimize required storage space and enhance job site safety. Our insulation products reduce the incidence of corrosion under insulation, which is a significant maintenance cost and safety issue in energy infrastructure facilities. Many of our insulation products also offer strong fire protection, which is a critical performance requirement in our markets. We believe our array of product attributes provides strong competitive advantages over traditional insulation. Although competing insulation materials may have one or more comparable attributes, we believe that no single insulation material currently available offers all of the properties of our aerogel insulation products.
 Our aerogel thermal barrier products enable our customers to enhance the safety and performance of their lithium-ion battery systems. These barriers are designed to impede the propagation of thermal runaway in lithium-ion battery systems both at the battery cell and battery pack level across multiple lithium-ion battery system architectures. Our ultra-thin, lightweight and flexible thermal barriers allow battery manufacturers to achieve critical safety goals without sacrificing energy density. We believe we offer the best available technology in the management of thermal runaway in the electric vehicle market.
 Total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $100.3 million, $139.4 million and $104.4 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, based on shipment destination or research services location, our U.S. revenue was $44.8 million, $58.3 million and $41.7 million, respectively, and our international revenue was $55.5 million, $81.0 million and $62.6 million, respectively.
 With regard to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented and are following safe practices recommended by public health authorities and other government entities. We will continue to focus on the safety and health of our employees, customers and vendors. We have implemented various precautionary measures, including remote work arrangements, restricted business travel and procedures for social distancing, face coverings and safe hygiene. We continue to monitor public health guidance as it evolves and plan to adapt our practices as appropriate. Refer to the section below entitled “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for more information concerning risks to our business associated with COVID-19.
 We manufacture our products using our proprietary technology at our facility in East Providence, Rhode Island. We have operated the East Providence facility since 2008 and have increased our annual capacity in phases through December 31, 2020 to 55 million square feet of aerogel blankets. We are currently engaged in an initiative, which we refer to as EP20, designed to increase the capacity of the East Providence facility to 60 million square feet of aerogel blankets by the end of 2021. In addition, we anticipate that we will need to construct a state-of-the-art thermal barrier fabrication operation, hire dedicated thermal barrier fabrication employees, and increase our aerogel blanket manufacturing capacity to keep pace with the significant potential demand for our PyroThin thermal barriers from the electric vehicle market. Accordingly, we are in the early stages of planning a significant expansion of our aerogel capacity prior to the end of 2023. The expected elements of the completed expansion plan will include the size of the required capacity expansion, the selection of an optimal manufacturing site for the expansion, the appropriate financing structure to fund the project fully and a detailed timeline for the construction and operation of the facility.
 Financial information about our product and research services revenues, net loss per share and our total assets are provided in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Our Markets and Competition
 Our principal market is the energy infrastructure insulation market. This market is global, well-established and includes large and well-capitalized end-users. This market includes companies operating refinery, petrochemical, oil production, and LNG production and storage facilities. The market also includes firms operating gas, coal, nuclear, hydro and solar thermal power generating plants and district energy systems. Insulation systems in the energy infrastructure market are designed to maintain hot and cold process equipment, piping and storage tanks at optimal temperatures, to protect plant and equipment from the elements and from the risk of fire, and to protect workers. The market is served by a well-organized, well-established, worldwide network of distributors, contractors and engineers.

Demand for insulation in the energy infrastructure market is composed of demand associated with new-build construction of facilities, capital expansions and related capital projects, as well as with routine, non-discretionary maintenance programs within existing facilities. Capital expansions and related capital projects in the energy infrastructure market are driven primarily by overall economic growth and projected growth in energy demand. Maintenance programs are essential to optimal operation of process equipment, to protect workers and to minimize the risk of a catastrophic loss. Accordingly, we believe that demand for insulation for maintenance purposes in comparison to capital projects is less affected by volatility associated with economic cycles, energy prices and other macroeconomic factors.
 The major end-use markets that drive demand for our products include oil refining, petrochemical, natural gas and LNG production and storage, onshore oil production, offshore oil production and power generation. Global energy demand is expected to increase in the long-term and, in order to serve this growing demand, we believe our end-use customers will continue to invest in major energy infrastructure projects.
 We have also developed and are commercializing a proprietary line of aerogel thermal barriers for use in lithium-ion batteries. The market for our thermal barrier products encompasses batteries used in both mobile platforms, including automobiles, trucks, buses and light aircraft, and fixed platforms, including grid storage and other commercial applications. The global lithium-ion battery market is estimated to be more than $40.0 billion in 2020 and is both growing and evolving rapidly. Our thermal barrier products allow our customers to enhance the safety of their high-energy density lithium-ion battery platforms. We believe that as the e-mobility and energy storage markets require increasingly powerful lithium-ion battery systems, the demand for our aerogel thermal barriers will grow rapidly as the market players seek to reduce the associated risk of thermal runaway.
 On September 17, 2020, we entered into a contract with a major U.S. automotive original equipment manufacturer to supply fabricated, multi-part thermal barriers for use in the battery system of its next-generation electric vehicles. Pursuant to the contract, we are obligated to supply the barriers at fixed annual prices and at volumes to be specified by the customer up to a daily maximum quantity through the term of the agreement, which expires on September 1, 2026. While the customer has agreed to purchase all of its requirement for barriers at locations to be designated from time to time from us, it has no obligation to purchase any minimum quantity of barriers under the contract. In addition, the customer may terminate the contract any time and for any or no reason. All other terms of the contract are generally consistent with the customer’s standard purchase terms, including customary quality and warranty provisions.
 We also sell our products for use in the building materials and other end markets, including for the fabrication of insulation parts by original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs. These OEMs develop products incorporating our aerogel blankets for applications in a diverse set of markets including military aircraft, trains, buses, appliances, apparel, footwear and outdoor gear. While these are not presently our core markets, we anticipate that we will allocate a growing portion of our manufacturing capacity to serve these markets in the long term. We believe the key performance criteria for insulation in these markets and applications include thermal performance, compact design, durability and fire resistance.
 We operate in a highly competitive environment. In the energy infrastructure and building materials markets, we compete with traditional insulation materials based on product performance, price, availability and proximity to the customer. Customers may choose among a variety of insulation materials that offer a range of characteristics including thermal performance, durability, vapor permeability, moisture resistance, ease of installation and upfront and lifecycle costs. Within each type of insulation material, there is also competition between the manufacturers of that material. Most types of traditional insulation materials are produced by a number of different manufacturers and once customers have chosen the type of insulation material that they intend to use, they will choose a manufacturer of that material based primarily on each manufacturer’s price and delivery schedule. Insulation manufacturers include a range of large, high-volume, multinational manufacturers offering branded products and strong technical support services to small, low-volume, local manufacturers offering low prices and limited customer support.
 We believe the primary competitive factors in these markets are:
  
• | product performance (along multiple criteria), quality and fitness for purpose;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product price, installed cost and lifecycle cost;
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | product availability; and
--+--------------------------


• | proximity to customer and logistics.
--+-------------------------------------

 Our products are priced at a premium to traditional insulation materials. While our competitors offer many traditional insulation products that are priced below our products on a per-unit basis, we believe our products have superior performance attributes and may have the lowest cost on a fully-installed basis or offer significant life-cycle cost savings.

Competition in the thermal barrier market is evolving. We believe our patented aerogel thermal barrier technology offers a unique combination of attributes to mitigate thermal runaway in lithium-ion battery systems. These attributes include industry-leading thermal performance, limited combustibility, tunable compressibility and scalable density. We expect to face increasing competition within the thermal barrier market over the next several years as new entrants seek to develop and market their own technologies and solutions.
 We compete in the aerogel materials market with Cabot Corporation, Armacell International S.A., Guangdong Alison Hi-Tech Co., Ltd. and Nano Tech Co., Ltd. and a growing number of other competitors that manufacture, sell or resell aerogel insulation products. We expect to face increasing competition in the aerogel insulation market over the next several years as existing competitors and new entrants seek to develop and market their own aerogel products. In addition to other aerogel insulation products, we also encounter competition from innovatively packaged traditional insulation materials that compete with our products based on one or more performance factors. 
 Within each of our target markets, we encounter one or more of these organizations or their resellers and a significant number of other aggressive national, regional and local suppliers of traditional insulation products. Our competitors are seeking to enhance traditional insulation materials and to develop and introduce new and emerging insulation technologies. Competing technologies that outperform our insulation products in one or more performance attributes could be developed and successfully introduced. See “Risk Factors —The energy infrastructure insulation market is highly competitive; if we are unable to compete successfully, we may not be able to increase or maintain our market share and revenues.”
 Our market share in 2020 was approximately 4% of the estimated $3.1 billion annual global market for energy infrastructure insulation materials. Our market share in 2020 in the building materials, thermal barrier and other markets was not significant. Many of our competitors have greater market presence, larger market share, longer operating histories, stronger name recognition, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, technical, sales and marketing, manufacturing and other resources than we have and may be better able to withstand volatility within the industry and throughout the economy as a whole while retaining greater operating and financial flexibility. If our competitors lower their prices, or develop new products with better performance, or if we are unable to compete effectively, our growth opportunities, share of the market, margins and profitability may decline.
 Our Competitive Strengths
 Because insulation is used in a wide variety of demanding applications, insulation materials must satisfy a wide range of performance criteria on a cost-effective basis. We believe that our aerogel technology has allowed us to create superior insulation products for our energy, building materials and thermal barrier markets that will allow us to continue to grow our share of the global insulation and thermal barrier market. We believe that the potential for significant technological innovation in traditional materials is limited and that new high-performance materials will be required to meet evolving market requirements for energy efficient insulation and thermal barrier systems. Our line of high-performance aerogel products is positioned to meet these requirements. Our solutions are driven by our innovative and proprietary technology that produces aerogels in a flexible and industrially robust blanket form and is supported by over 20 years of research and development dedicated to new aerogel compositions, form factors and manufacturing technologies. We believe our aerogel blankets deliver a superior combination of performance attributes that enable energy infrastructure and building materials end-users to save money, improve resource efficiency, preserve operating assets and protect workers across a wide range of applications in our target markets. We believe our patented aerogel thermal barriers offer an industry-leading combination of attributes to mitigate thermal runaway in lithium-ion battery systems. 
 We believe the following combination of capabilities distinguishes us from our competitors and positions us to continue to gain market share in the energy infrastructure, building materials and electric vehicle markets:
  
• | Disruptive Products with a Compelling Value Proposition. Our aerogel insulation provides two to five times the thermal performance of widely used traditional insulation in a thin, easy-to-use and durable blanket form. We believe our array of product attributes provides strong competitive advantages over traditional insulation and will enable us to gain a larger share of the energy infrastructure insulation market. In addition, our aerogel thermal barriers offer a combination of attributes that provide industry-leading protection against thermal runaway in lithium-ion batteries. We believe our thermal barriers are the market leading technological solution to combat thermal runaway and we will gain share within the market for lithium-ion batteries used in the e-mobility and grid storage markets. Although competing materials may have one or more comparable attributes, we believe that no single insulation or thermal barrier materials currently available offer all of the properties of our aerogel products.

Our Aerogel Products
 Silica aerogels are highly porous structures in which 97% of the volume consists of air trapped between intertwined clusters of amorphous silica solids. Silica aerogels are a very low-density solids and are extremely fragile materials. However, our proprietary manufacturing process produces silica aerogels in a flexible, resilient, durable and easy-to-use blanket form.

The core raw material in the production of our aerogel insulation products is silica precursors. Our manufacturing process initially creates a semi-solid alcogel in which the silica structure is filled with ethanol. We produce aerogel by means of a supercritical extraction process that removes ethanol from the gel and replaces it with air. Our process allows the ethanol to be extracted without causing the solid matrix in the gel to collapse from capillary forces.
 Our material costs were 44%, 48% and 47% of product revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We seek to lower our manufacturing costs, while maintaining appropriate performance characteristics, and to improve the per square foot costs of our silica aerogel blankets by optimizing our formulations to reduce material costs, by enhancing manufacturing process controls to improve yields, by realizing price reductions from existing vendors, by qualifying new vendors and by reducing shipping costs. Our objective is both to reduce costs to enhance our competitive position and to ensure we deliver high quality products to our customers.
 The materials used in the production of our silica aerogel products consist primarily of several silica precursors, fiber batting, and other additives. The markets for these materials are generally competitive and multiple sources of supply exist for all of our raw materials. However, from time-to-time, we have experienced a significant increase in the price of certain silica precursors due to supply imbalances in the silanes market. We are actively working to reformulate our products to reduce our reliance on the materials that are susceptible to significant price fluctuations. We are also working to expand the geographic diversity of our supply base to reduce the risk of demand and supply imbalances in any one country or region.
 We purchase silica precursors from several suppliers in the United States, Europe and Asia, including China. Based on the current level of demand for our products, we believe that an adequate long-term supply of silica precursors is available. However, if demand for our products increases rapidly, we will need to work with suppliers to ensure that an adequate long-term supply of silica precursors will be available at competitive prices. Suppliers of silica precursors include industrial companies that produce the materials directly or that produce them as a byproduct of other industrial processes. We are working with a number of these suppliers to plan for our potential future needs and to develop our processes to reduce the long-term cost impact of these materials. See “Risk Factors — Shortages of the raw materials used in the production of our products, increases in the cost of such materials or disruptions in our supply chain could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.”

 R-Values by Material
 Insulation is a material or combination of materials that slows the transfer of heat from one side of the material to the other. The composition of our aerogel products minimizes the three mechanisms of thermal transport:
  
• | Conduction. Heat conduction through a material is correlated to the material’s density. Aerogels are very low-density solids. As a result, thermal conductivity through the aerogel material itself is extremely low.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Convection. Heat convection in gases is through movement of gas molecules. Due to the restricted movement of gases in the nanoporous aerogel structure, thermal convection is eliminated inside the aerogels.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Radiation. Radiation requires no medium to transfer the heat. Thermal radiation is partially absorbed by aerogels. Our aerogel products also contain infrared absorbing additives to significantly reduce radiant heat transfer.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe our aerogel products offer the lowest levels of thermal conductivity, or best insulating performance, of any widely used insulation or thermal barrier available on the market today.
 The lower a material’s thermal conductivity, the more slowly heat is transferred through the material. R-values are a commonly used measure of an insulating material’s resistance to heat transfer. R-value is calculated as the thickness of an insulation material divided by the thermal conductivity of the insulation material. Materials with higher R-values have lower thermal conductivity and are better insulators. Traditional and specialty insulation materials provide a range of R-values. Aerogels have the highest R-value per unit of thickness in comparison to traditional insulation materials.
 Qualification for Use
 Our products have undergone rigorous testing and are now qualified for global usage in both routine maintenance and in capital projects at many of the world’s largest oil producers, refiners and petrochemical companies and prospectively with the next-generation lithium-ion battery systems of two of the largest electric vehicle manufacturers. These end-users of our products have well defined practices, codes, specifications and standards for materials and systems installed in their vehicles or used in their facilities. These specifications include insulation system design standards, material qualification and selection processes, insulation application practices and quality control requirements. As part of the material qualification process established by these companies, a new insulation or thermal barrier product must meet general industry standards, such as consensus standards developed by ASTM International, and, in many cases, company-specific internal standards to be considered and approved for use or designed into vehicle platforms. In addition, most of these companies require one or more field trials of tests to evaluate fitness for use in specific applications. These companies either run these qualification processes and field trials internally or through third parties engaged by them, and they generally do not publicly disclose the results of their testing. While the specific processes and timelines vary from company to company, in general, upon successful completion of the qualification process for an insulation or thermal barrier product, 
 10

an end-user will typically deem the product to be qualified for use in its facilities on a local, regional or global basis for one or more applications or vehicles. Because our end-use customers are typically businesses with very large operations in multiple sites, our insulation or thermal barrier sales likely represent only a small portion of the total product used by any one of these companies. Accordingly, once our products are qualified or designed into a platform at a specified company, we continue to seek to expand use of our products by the end-use customer in additional applications, platforms, locations or vehicles.
 Our Sales Channel
 We market and sell our products primarily through our global sales force. Our sales personnel are based in North America, Europe and Asia and travel extensively to market and sell our products to new and existing customers. The efforts of our sales force are supported by a small number of sales consultants with extensive knowledge of a particular market or region. Our sales force establishes and maintains customer and partner relationships, delivers highly technical information and provides first class customer service. We plan to expand our sales force and business development resources globally to support anticipated growth in customers and demand for our products.
 Our sales force calls on and maintains relationships with participants at all levels of the energy infrastructure industry supply chain. We have established a network of insulation distributors to ensure rapid delivery of our products in critical regions. Our sales personnel work to educate insulation contractors about the technical and operating cost advantages of aerogel blankets. Our sales force also works directly with end-users and engineering firms to promote qualification, specification and wider acceptance of our products in existing and new applications. In the energy infrastructure market, we rely heavily on the existing and well-established channel of distributors and contractors to deliver products to our customers. In addition, our sales and business development personnel work directly with OEMs and strategic partners, including within the electric vehicle industry, to create new product designs and solutions to expand our market reach.
 The sales cycle for a new insulation material or thermal barrier is typically lengthy. Our sales cycle from initial customer contact to widespread use can take from one to three years, although we typically realize increasing revenue at each stage in the cycle. We believe our relationships with technically sophisticated customers and strategic partners serve to validate our technology, products and value proposition within a target market. These relationships have proven to accelerate the sales cycle with other customers within specific markets and to facilitate growth in market share. We have focused our marketing efforts on developing technical support materials, installation guides, case studies and general awareness of the superior performance of our aerogel blankets and thermal barriers. We rely principally on our website, social media, printed technical materials, participation in industry conferences and tradeshows and presentation of technical papers to communicate our message to existing and potential customers. We also receive strong word-of-mouth support from the growing network of distributors, installation contractors, OEMs, strategic partners and end-users that understand the benefits of our products.
 As of December 31, 2020, we had 46 sales and marketing professionals worldwide. Their efforts were supported by a team of ten sales consultants.

Electric Vehicle Market
 Our thermal barrier products have been adopted for use in the electric vehicle battery systems of a major U.S. automotive manufacturer and by a leading Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer. We believe that our customer base could expand in the near term to include manufacturers of battery and battery systems for use in the electric vehicle and grid storage markets.
 Our carbon aerogel program seeks to increase the performance of lithium-ion battery cells to enable electric vehicle manufacturers to extend the driving range and reduce the cost of electric vehicles, among other uses. We are targeting the manufacturers of battery components, batteries, grid battery systems, and electric vehicles as potential customers for our carbon aerogel materials.
 Building Materials and Other Markets
 Traditionally, we have relied on the efforts of a small network of partners, OEMs and fabrication houses to serve the building materials, transportation, apparel and appliance markets. These partners, OEMs and fabricators are manufacturers of components and systems for buildings, refrigerated and hot appliances, cold storage equipment, automobiles, aircraft, trains and electronic sectors and manufacturers of outdoor gear and apparel. In addition, we have collaborated with BASF to develop and commercialize innovative products optimized to meet the needs of the building materials market. The end-users of our products in these markets include a wide range of institutions, businesses, individuals, municipalities and government agencies.
Manufacturing
 We manufacture our products using our proprietary technology at our facility located in East Providence, Rhode Island. We have operated the East Providence facility since 2008 and have significantly increased manufacturing capacity and productivity during the period. Our manufacturing process is proven, scalable and can meet increasing demand.
 Our manufacturing group is led by a seasoned team with management experience at global industrial and specialty chemical companies. Our manufacturing workforce is skilled and we have experienced employee turnover consistent with our industry. We have well-defined operating processes and maintenance, environmental, health and safety programs to support our operations. We employ statistical processes and quality controls in our manufacturing systems. We routinely measure and monitor thermal conductivity, hydrophobicity and other key properties of the aerogel blankets produced in our manufacturing operations. We are ISO 9001:2015 certified.

 We have increased our annual capacity in phases through December 31, 2020 to 55 million square feet of aerogel blankets. We are currently engaged in an initiative, which we refer to as EP20, designed to increase the capacity of the East Providence facility to 60 million square feet of aerogel blankets by the end of 2021. In addition, we anticipate that we will need to construct a state-of-the-art thermal barrier fabrication operation, hire dedicated thermal barrier fabrication employees, and increase our aerogel blanket manufacturing capacity to keep pace with the significant potential demand for our PyroThin thermal barriers. Accordingly, we are in the early stages of planning a significant expansion of our aerogel capacity prior to the end of 2023. The expected elements of the completed expansion plan will include the size of the required capacity expansion, the selection of an optimal manufacturing site for the expansion, the appropriate financing structure to fund the project fully and a detailed timeline for the construction and operation of the facility.
 We directly control all stages in the manufacture of our aerogel blankets. Our direct ownership of manufacturing operations allows us to maintain control of proprietary process technologies and to control product quality. Our production of aerogel blankets utilizes a continuous process and consists of the following key steps:
  
• | Sol Preparation. Mixing of silica precursors in ethanol, a catalyst and additives in set formulas to deliver the target properties of the resultant aerogel.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Casting. Combination of the sol and fiber batting and initial formation of the gel structure.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Aging. Bathing of the gel blankets in fluids to impart desired physical and thermal properties.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Extraction. Supercritical extraction of the ethanol liquid from the gel blanket to produce a dried aerogel blanket.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Heat Treatment. Drying to remove trace ethanol, salts and water from the aerogel blankets.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 13


 
• | Finishing. Coating to enhance quality and product handling.
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | Fabrication. Cutting, lamination, and production of components and multi-layer systems for custom applications in the electric vehicle and subsea markets.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Quality Control. Utilizing statistical process and quality controls to measure thermal conductivity, hydrophobicity and other key properties of our aerogel products.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our material costs were 44%, 48% and 47% of product revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 
 The materials used in the production of our products consist primarily of a several silica precursors, fiber batting, and other additives. The markets for these materials are generally competitive and multiple sources of supply exist for all of our raw materials. However, during 2018, we experienced a significant increase in the price of certain silica precursors due to a supply imbalance in the silanes market. We are actively working to reformulate our products to reduce our reliance on materials that are susceptible to significant price fluctuations. We are also working to expand the geographic diversity of our supply base to reduce the risk of demand and supply imbalances in any one country or region.
 We purchase silica precursors from several suppliers in the United States, Europe and Asia, including China. Based on the current level of demand for our products, we believe that an adequate long-term supply of silica precursors is available. However, if demand for our products increases rapidly, we will need to work with suppliers to ensure that the long-term supply of silica precursors will be available at competitive prices. Suppliers of silica precursors include industrial companies that produce the materials directly or that produce them as a byproduct of other industrial processes. We are working with a number of suppliers to plan for our potential future needs and to develop our processes to reduce the long-term cost impact of these materials. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business and Strategy — Shortages of the raw materials used in the production of our products, increases in the cost of such materials or disruptions in our supply chain could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.”
 We seek to lower our manufacturing costs, while maintaining appropriate performance characteristics, and to improve the per square foot costs of our aerogel blankets by optimizing our formulations to reduce material costs, by enhancing manufacturing process controls to improve yields, by realizing price reductions from existing vendors, by qualifying new vendors and by reducing shipping costs. In addition, we believe additional opportunities to realize production efficiencies and to reduce per unit overhead costs will arise with growth in the scale of our manufacturing operations. Our objective is both to reduce costs to enhance our competitive advantage and to ensure we deliver high quality finished products to our customers. 
 Research and Development
 The mission of our research and development team is to leverage our aerogel technology platform in support of our commercial objectives. In our existing markets, research and development personnel design new and improved insulation products to enhance our value to customers and to expand our revenue potential. Our materials scientists and engineers also seek to develop enhanced chemical and process technologies to improve yields, lower manufacturing costs and improve product performance. In new markets, research and development personnel seek to exploit the unique characteristics of aerogels, including low thermal conductivity, high surface area, high electrical conductivity, and tunable porosity, to develop aerogel-enhanced products and next generation technology addressing complex and unmet market needs. 
 Our research and development expenditures were $8.7 million, $8.4 million and $6.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In addition, we spent $0.1 million, $1.3 million and $1.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, on research and development activities sponsored by federal and other government agencies. 
 Contract Research and Government Support
 We have received funding from a number of federal and other government agencies in support of our research and development and manufacturing activities. Research performed under contract to the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy and other institutions allowed us to develop and leverage technologies into broader commercial applications. We also worked closely with customers in government and industry to develop potential aerogel solutions that leveraged not only the thermal insulation performance but other benefits of aerogels as well. 
 In late 2019, we decided to wind down our existing contract research activities. This decision reflected our desire to focus our research and development resources on initiatives to improve the profitability of our existing business and on efforts to develop new products and next generation technology with application in new, high value market segments. 
 14

We have received $58.7 million in funding under government contracts from inception through December 31, 2020. Our contract research revenue was $0.4 million, $2.4 million and $2.2 million for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
 Intellectual Property
 Our success depends in part upon our ability to obtain, maintain and enforce intellectual property rights that cover our aerogel technology platform, including, product forms, applications and/or manufacturing technologies and the technology or know-how that enables these product forms, applications, technologies and specifications, to avoid and defend against claims that we infringe the intellectual property rights of others, and to prevent the unauthorized use of our intellectual property. Since aerogels were developed more than 80 years ago, there has been a wide range of research, development and publication on aerogels and related technologies, which make it difficult to establish intellectual property rights to many key elements of aerogel technology and to obtain meaningful patent protection. Where appropriate, we seek to protect our rights by filing patent applications in United States and other key foreign jurisdictions related to products, processes, technology and improvements that we consider patentable and important to our business and, in particular, our aerogel technology, product forms and their applications in promising markets and our manufacturing technologies. We also rely on trade secrets, trademarks, licensing agreements, confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements and continuing technological innovation to safeguard our intellectual property rights and develop and maintain our competitive edge.
 As of December 31, 2020, we owned 49 issued U.S. patents, 29 pending U.S. patent applications (including seven issued U.S. patents and two pending U.S. patent application that we co-own with third parties), 95 issued foreign patents, 84 pending foreign patent applications (including 23 issued foreign patents and ten pending foreign patent applications that we co-own with third parties), and one allowed foreign patent. The patents that we own are generally effective for 20 years from the filing date of the earliest application to which each U.S. patent claims priority. The scope of each of our foreign patents varies in accordance with local law. Our early product patent family covering a fiber-reinforced aerogel composition will expire in December 2021.
 In May 2016, we filed a complaint for patent infringement against Nano Tech Co., Ltd. (Nano), and Guangdong Alison Hi Tech., Ltd. (Alison) in the International Trade Commission, or ITC. In February 2018, the ITC issued its final determination that Nano and Alison had infringed asserted Aspen patents and that they have not proven the patents are invalid except with respect to one dependent product claim, which the ITC found was not infringed. The ITC affirmed that Alison and Nano each violated Section 337 of the Tariff Act and issued a limited exclusion order prohibiting importation of infringing aerogel insulation products manufactured by Alison and Nano. Alison’s appeal with respect to a product patent to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC) was rejected, and resulted in CAFC affirming the validity of our patent. The exclusion order, which is enforced by the United States Customs and Border Protection, is currently in effect. 
 Additionally, the USPTO denied Alison’s requests to invalidate the claims of four of our patents in Inter-Partes Review. Alison also filed multiple similar requests with the Chinese Patent Office (SIPO), seeking to invalidate our Chinese manufacturing process patents and two of our Chinese product patents. With respect to one of those requests, not withdrawn previously by Alison, the Patent Review Board of SIPO (PRB), issued a decision upholding the validity of Aspen’s issued patent as amended in the proceedings. Alison has appealed the PRB’s decision to the Beijing IP court. On July 25, 2020, the Beijing IP court dismissed Alison’s appeal and upheld the validity of Aspen’s patent and we received this decision on September 15, 2020. Nano has also filed a request seeking invalidation of a product patent at SIPO. After the oral hearing at PRB, Nano withdrew its invalidation request. On September 23, 2019, Alison filed yet another request to invalidate the same patent, whose validity was previously confirmed by PRB. On January 23, 2020 PRB denied Alison’s latest invalidation request. 
 In April 2016, we also filed a patent infringement suit at the District Court in Mannheim, Germany (Mannheim court), against Nano, Alison and two European resellers asserting their infringement of one of our German patents. We subsequently asserted infringement of another three patents against Nano, Alison and a European reseller of Alison’s products at the Mannheim court. We have since settled with one European reseller in exchange for a commitment not to procure infringing products and cooperation with our case. In January 2018, the court issued a series of judgments by acknowledgement (German, “Anerkenntnisurteil”) finding the second reseller, Hiltex, liable for infringement and also issued injunctions against Hiltex. The judgments resulted from a settlement agreement in which Hiltex agreed not to resell the infringing products in Europe where at least one of the asserted patents are active. On March 8, 2019, the Mannheim court issued two separate judgments in cases against Nano and Alison, respectively. The Mannheim court determined that both Nano and Alison are infringing on Aspen’s EP1638750 (750 Patent) in connection with their respective products. The court also issued injunctions prohibiting the offer, putting on the market, using, importing or possessing the infringing products. The court found the defendants liable to us for damages since September 22, 2012. The court also ordered the defendants to provide information on the scope of the acts of infringement committed since August 22, 2012, and a recall of infringing products. The court ordered Nano and Alison to bear the costs of the legal proceedings and reimburse statutory attorneys’ costs and expenses to us, that exact amount of which is yet to be determined. Nano and Alison have appealed the judgments of the Mannheim court. Nano subsequently withdrew the appeal while Alison’s appeal is currently pending.
 15

The Mannheim court issued two decisions on December 23, 2019 finding that Alison infringed the 577 Patent and the 950 Patent and also issued injunctions prohibiting Alison from continuing infringement in connection with any aerogel sheets. The December 2019 decisions against Alison have now become final and binding. The Mannheim court issued two decisions on July 31, 2020 finding that Nano infringed each of the 577 Patent and the 950 Patent. In addition to granting other remedies, the court also issued injunctions prohibiting the offer, putting on the market, using, importing or possessing any aerogel sheets. After the passing of deadline to file appeals, these decisions have now become final. 
 Nano and Alison also initiated nullity actions in German Federal Patent Court in Munich against our asserted German patents. On September 25, 2018, the Federal Patent Court in Munich dismissed the challenge to the validity of 750 Patent which has subsequently become final. Nano and Alison also filed an opposition to one of the asserted patents at the EPO. In December 2018, the opposition division of EPO determined the patent, EP2813338 (338 Patent), was invalid on formality grounds and decided to revoke it, which determination is currently under appeal at the EPO Board of appeals. On March 19 and 20, 2019 the German Federal Patent Court in Munich (FPC) conducted oral proceedings and voided four claims in EP2415577 (577 Patent) and confirmed the validity of challenged claims in EP2422950 (950 Patent) within the scope of silica gels. These FPC judgments are now final and binding on the parties. Nano had filed another nullity action seeking to invalidate the remaining claims in the 577 Patent which action Nano subsequently failed to pursue. On June 17, 2020, Nano also filed an opposition to a recently issued Aspen Patent EP3120983B1, titled “Continuous Sheet of Gel Materials and Continuous sheet of Aerogel”.
 Additionally, a reseller of Nano’s products in Taiwan challenged the validity of one of our patents in Taiwan in 2018. After careful review of our written response, the Taiwanese patent office has determined the patent as valid and dismissed the challenge in December 2018. In 2018, LG Chem Ltd. challenged the validity of one of our patents in Korea at the IPTAB of the Korean Intellectual Property Office. After conducting an oral hearing, the IPTAB issued a decision on November 30, 2019 upholding claims related to aerogel sheets incorporating fibers. On January 14, 2021 the Korean Patent Court confirmed the validity of the claims related to aerogel sheets incorporating fibers. 
 Due to their nature, it is difficult to predict the outcome or the costs involved in any litigation. Furthermore, our adversaries may have significant resources and interest to litigate and therefore, these litigation matters could be protracted and may ultimately involve significant legal expenses. We have incurred approximately $9.3 million of expenses related to this litigation since 2015 through December 31, 2020. In addition to the foregoing, we have been and may be from time to time party to other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business and to other patent enforcement actions to assert our patent rights.
 We believe that having distinctive names is an important factor in marketing our products, and therefore we use trademarks to brand some of our products, including Pyrogel, PyroThin, Cryogel and Spaceloft. As of December 31, 2020, we had five trademark registrations in the United States, one trademark registration with the World Intellectual Property Organization, and 54 trademark registrations in foreign jurisdictions, including the European Union, Japan, China, Canada, South Korea and Brazil. Additionally, we had seven pending foreign trademark applications. Although we have a foreign trademark registration program for selected marks, our approach may not be comprehensive and we may not be able to register or use such marks in each foreign country in which we seek registration.
 Cross License Agreement with Cabot Corporation
 In April 2006, we entered into a cross license agreement with Cabot Corporation, as amended in September 2007, in which each party granted certain intellectual property rights to the other party. The cross license agreement remains in effect until the expiration of the last to expire of the issued patents or patent applications and acquired patents licensed thereunder. We hold a non-exclusive, worldwide license to those patents and patent applications owned or licensed by Cabot that are necessary for us to (i) practice our manufacturing technology within a field of use, which is defined in accordance with the specific chemistry of our aerogel products and the supercritical fluid technology that we use in our manufacturing technology and (ii) use and sell the resulting aerogel blanket and derivative products. We paid Cabot $38 million over a period of approximately seven years, with the last payment made in March 2013, in connection with this license agreement. We have granted to Cabot a reciprocal, non-exclusive, worldwide license to certain patents and patent applications that we own that are necessary for Cabot to practice its processes within a field of use defined in accordance with the specific chemistry in its aerogel products and the drying technology that it uses to manufacture its products. The grant of license to each party covers issued patents, patent applications and patents issued from such counterpart applications, as well as patents licensed or acquired during a specified period, in each case that claim aerogels, or methods, materials of manufacture, or uses of aerogels.

 Employees
 As of December 31, 2020, we had 290 full-time employees with 36 in research and development, 179 in manufacturing operations and supply chain, 46 in sales and marketing and 29 in general and administrative functions. Of our employees, 274 are located in the United States and 16 are located abroad. We consider our current relationship with our employees to be of good standing. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or have collective bargaining agreements.
Seasonality
 Our industry and product offering makes us less susceptible to seasonal patterns as our operating results are generated in part by demand for insulation associated with new-build construction of facilities, capital expansions and related capital projects, and larger maintenance-related projects in the energy infrastructure market. Historically, our third and fourth quarter results have shown increased levels of revenue, which we believe is associated with our end-use customers’ maintenance schedules and timing of capital projects.
Environmental Matters
 We are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations designed to protect the environment and to regulate the discharge of materials into the environment. We believe that our policies, practices, and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and associated financial liability. To date, environmental control regulations have not had a significant adverse effect on our overall operations. See “Risk Factors — We may incur significant costs complying with environmental, health and safety laws and related claims, and failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to significant liabilities, which could adversely affect our results of operations.”
