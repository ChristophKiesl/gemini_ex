Item 1. | Business

Overview
R1 RCM is a leading provider of technology-driven solutions that transform the patient experience and financial performance of healthcare providers. Our services help healthcare providers generate sustainable improvements in their operating margins and cash flows while also enhancing patient, physician, and staff satisfaction for our customers.
We achieve these results for our customers by managing healthcare providers’ revenue cycle operations, which encompass processes including patient registration, insurance and benefit verification, medical treatment documentation and coding, bill preparation, and collections from patients and payers. We do so by deploying a unique operating model that leverages our extensive healthcare site experience, innovative technology, and process excellence. We assist our RCM customers in managing their revenue cycle operating costs while simultaneously increasing the portion of the maximum potential services revenue they receive. Together, these benefits can generate significant and sustainable improvements in operating margins and cash flows for our customers. 
Our primary service offering consists of end-to-end RCM services for health systems, hospitals, and physician groups, which we deploy through an operating partner relationship or a co-managed relationship. Under an operating partner relationship, we provide comprehensive revenue cycle infrastructure to providers, including all revenue cycle personnel, technology solutions, and process workflow. Under a co-managed relationship, we leverage our customers’ existing RCM staff and processes, and supplement them with our infused management, subject matter specialists, proprietary technology solutions, and other resources. Under the operating partner model, we record higher revenue and expenses due to the fact that almost all of the revenue cycle personnel are our employees and more third-party vendor contracts are controlled by us. Under the co-managed model, the majority of the revenue cycle personnel and more third-party vendor contracts remain with the customer and those costs are netted against our co-managed revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, substantially all of our net operating and incentive fees from end-to-end RCM services were generated under the operating partner model.

We also offer modular services, allowing customers to engage us for only specific components of our end-to-end RCM service offering, such as physician advisory services (“PAS”), practice management (“PM”), revenue integrity solutions (“RIS”), patient experience (“PX”), coding management, and business office services. Our PAS offering assists healthcare organizations in complying with payer requirements regarding whether to classify a hospital visit as an in-patient or an out-patient observation case for billing purposes. Our PM services offer administrative and operational support to allow healthcare providers to focus on delivering high quality patient care and outsource non-core functions to us. Our RIS offering includes charge capture, charge description master (“CDM”) maintenance, and pricing services that help providers ensure they are capturing the maximum net compliant revenue for services delivered. Our PX offering helps patients manage their data in one easy-to-use environment, enabling eligibility validation and insurance plan attribution, demographic accuracy, meeting authorization and referral requirements, medical necessity validation, and patient out-of-pocket cost estimation. Our coding management offering drives performance, quality, and consistent results via business intelligence and analysis, human capital management, an accountability framework, and a quality management program. Our business office services can help providers with the entire billing function or to specifically recoup revenue that may otherwise be lost by focusing skilled resources in lower priority areas with significant revenue potential. 
Once implemented, our technology solutions, processes, and services are deeply embedded in our customers’ day-to-day revenue cycle operations. We believe our service offerings are adaptable to meet an evolving healthcare regulatory environment, technology standards, and market trends. 
Revenue Cycle Software and Services Market 
Revenue cycle is an important function for healthcare providers as they seek to collect payment due to them from health insurance companies and patients. Healthcare providers operate their revenue cycle with a combination of labor, software, and services vendors. Third-party vendors offer various solutions including consulting services, software, and other services, including point solutions that cover one or multiple components of the revenue cycle and full outsourcing services, among others. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) projects hospital care expenditures in the U.S. to amount to $1.39 trillion in 2021. We estimate the cost of hospital revenue cycle operations to be approximately 5% of revenue, resulting in a market size of $70 billion. Additionally, CMS projects physician care expenditures to amount to $838 billion in 2021. We estimate cost of physician revenue cycle operations to be approximately 5.5% of revenue, resulting in a market size of $46 billion. According to Research and Markets, revenue cycle spend is projected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 12% through 2027.
Health systems are currently facing challenges in their revenue cycle operations based on several factors including: (1) more complex and clinical-outcomes based reimbursement, (2) industry consolidation amongst hospitals and across the continuum of care, (3) increasing patient responsibility of their medical bills, and (4) capital constraints to invest in the revenue cycle given financial difficulties and requirements to invest in improving clinical care. We believe these are positive trends for external vendors in the revenue cycle industry which we expect will drive further growth for the industry and our Company.
Segment
All of our significant operations are organized around the single business of providing revenue cycle operations for healthcare providers.
We view our operations and manage our business as one operating and reporting segment. All of our net services revenue and trade accounts receivable are derived from healthcare providers, primarily domiciled in the United States. The information about our business should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See Note 23, Segments and Customer Concentrations, to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding our segment and customer concentrations.
Our Services
Drawing on the combination of our extensive healthcare-site expertise, innovative technology, and process excellence, we seek to deliver measurable economic value to our customers across our RCM solutions.
End-To-End Revenue Cycle Management Offering
Our primary RCM service offering consists of comprehensive end-to-end RCM services, which address the full spectrum of revenue cycle challenges faced by healthcare providers. Our approach to deliver value for our customers is built on a holistic operating model designed to fit into a healthcare provider’s revenue cycle operations.
This operating model consists of four components:
Technology - Comprehensive revenue cycle workflow & analytics solutions - Our technology integrates across multiple host and payer systems and hard-wire our standard methods, operating metrics, and daily routines into an end-to-end technology platform.
Workflow - End-to-end workflow differentiated on outcomes - We deploy a fully cataloged, standardized methodology for revenue cycle execution from order intake and scheduling to claim reimbursement. The approach is based on standard structures and rigorous methods, tested and proven in multiple organizations and environments.
Operations - Scaled global delivery model & leading human capital - We bring experienced talent across global business services, centralized analytics, and deployment teams who all deliver one operating platform. Our teams understand the missions and unique needs of non-profit organizations and are trained, certified, and continuously developed to deliver on customer revenue cycle needs.
Analytics - Performance monitoring & management system - We use hundreds of operating metrics to drive comprehensive daily accountability and to enable front-line operators to deliver on differentiated business outcomes every single day.
Our RCM service offering is designed to adapt to a provider's organizational structure. We seek to integrate our technology, personnel, our accumulated body of knowledge, and our culture within each customer’s revenue cycle activities, with the expectation that we will enjoy a long-term collaborative relationship with each customer. We deliver technology and operational support in the form of both on-site management and centralized staffing to deliver improved efficiency and quality across all RCM functions.
Our end-to-end RCM agreements generally provide us with the opportunity to earn net operating fees and incentive fees. Net operating fees include gross base fees we charge our customers for operating the revenue cycle processes included in our agreements less corresponding costs of customers’ revenue cycle operations which we undertake to pay pursuant to our RCM agreements, and agreements on a fixed fee, per-use, and/or volumetric basis. We help our customers reduce their revenue cycle costs by implementing new operational practices, optimizing their technology suite, and deploying more efficient processes. We work with our customers to transfer aspects of their revenue cycle operations to our global business services operations, which typically results in lower operating costs than operating those aspects of the revenue cycle at the customers’ sites.
Incentive fees are performance-based fees related to agreed-upon improvements in financial or operating metrics at our customers. When using these metrics to calculate this improvement, we typically utilize metrics that are already being tracked by, or easily calculated from, our or our customers’ respective information systems and compare the results of those metrics against the results for the same metrics for a defined prior period.
We seek to improve our customers’ processes using a variety of techniques including:
•Gathering Complete Patient and Payer Information. We focus on gathering complete patient information and validating insurance eligibility and benefits so patient care services can be recorded and billed to the appropriate parties. For scheduled healthcare services, we educate patients as to their potential financial responsibilities before receiving care. Through our systems, we maintain an automated electronic scorecard which measures the efficiency of up-front data capture, authorization, billing, and collections throughout the life cycle of any given patient account. These scorecards are analyzed in the aggregate, and the results are used to help improve workflow processes and operational decisions for our customers.
•Improving Claims Filing and Collections. Through our proprietary technology and process expertise, we identify, for each patient encounter, the estimated amount due from the patient and the amount our customer should receive from a payer if terms of the applicable contract with the payer and patient policies are followed. Over time, we compare these amounts with the actual payments collected to help identify which payers, types of medical treatments and patients represent various levels of payment risk for a customer. Using proprietary algorithms and analytics, we consider actual reimbursement patterns to predict the payment risk associated with a customer’s claims to its payers, and we then direct increased attention and time to the riskiest accounts.
•Identifying Alternative Payment Sources. We use various methods to find payment sources for uninsured patients and reimbursement for services not covered by payers. Our patient financial screening technology and methodologies often identify federal, state, or private grant sources to help pay for healthcare services. These techniques are designed to ease the financial burden on uninsured or underinsured patients, increase the percentage of patient bills that are actually paid, and improve the total amount of reimbursement received by our customers.
•Employing Proprietary Technology and Algorithms. We employ a variety of proprietary data analytics and algorithms. For example, we identify patient accounts with financial risk by applying proprietary analysis techniques to the data we have collected. Our systems are designed to streamline work processes through the use of proprietary algorithms that focus revenue cycle staff effort on those accounts deemed to have the greatest potential for improving net revenue yield or charge capture. We adjust our proprietary predictive algorithms to reflect changes in payer and patient behavior based upon the knowledge we obtain from our entire customer base. As new customers are added and payer and patient behavior changes, the information we use to create our algorithms expands, increasing the accuracy, reliability, and value of such algorithms.
•Using Analytical Capabilities and Operational Excellence. We draw on the experience that we have gained from working with some of the best healthcare provider systems in the United States to train our customers’ staff about new and innovative RCM practices. We use sophisticated analytical procedures to identify specific opportunities to improve business processes.
•Increasing Charge Capture. We are able to help our customers increase their charge capture by implementing optimization techniques and related processes. We use sophisticated analytics software to help improve the accuracy of claims filings and the resolution of disputed claims from payers. We also overlay a range of capabilities designed to reduce missed charges, improve the clinical/reimbursement interface, and produce bills that comply with payer requirements and applicable healthcare regulations.
•Leveraging our Global Business Services Operations. We help our customers increase their revenue cycle efficiency by implementing improved practices, streamlining workflow processes, and outsourcing aspects of their revenue cycle operations to our global business services operations. Examples of services that can be completed at our global business services operations in the United States and India include pre-registration, medical transcription, cash posting, reconciliation of payments to billing records, and patient and payer follow-up. By leveraging the economies of scale and experience of our global business services operations, we believe that we offer our customers better quality services at a lower cost.
We believe that these techniques are enhanced by our proprietary and integrated technology, management experience, and well-developed processes. Our proprietary technology solutions include workflow automation and direct payer connection capabilities that enable revenue cycle staff to focus on problem accounts rather than on manual tasks, such as searching payer websites for insurance and benefits verification for all patients. We employ technology that identifies and isolates specific cases requiring review or action, using the same interface for all users, to automate a host of tasks that otherwise can consume a significant amount of staff time. Our proprietary technology enhances the ability of our customers' revenue cycle staff to improve their interaction with patients. We use real-time feedback from our customers to improve the functionality and performance of our technology and processes and incorporate these improvements into our service offerings on a regular basis. We strive to apply operational excellence throughout our customers' entire revenue cycle.
Modular Solutions
Our modular service solutions allow customers to engage us for specific components of end-to-end RCM and expanded service offerings. These service offerings, including PAS, PM, RIS, PX, coding management, and business office services, allow our customers to place their focus on delivering high quality patient care, while outsourcing non-core functions to us. Providing modular solutions allows us to expand our customer base utilizing technology and service offerings which have already been developed. 
Business Update
SCI Solutions, Inc. Acquisition
On April 1, 2020, we completed the acquisition of scheduling.com, Inc. d/b/a SCI Solutions, Inc. (“SCI”) pursuant to a stock purchase agreement dated as of January 9, 2020 (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”), by and among the Company, Clearsight Intermediate Holdings, Inc. (“Clearsight Holdings”), and Clearsight Group Holdings, LLC (the “Seller”) (the “SCI Acquisition”). At the closing of the transaction, we purchased from the Seller all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Clearsight Holdings, which owns all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of SCI. SCI is a leading provider of software-as-a-service (“SaaS”)-based scheduling and patient access solutions. SCI’s platform streamlines the patient and provider experience, creating efficient care networks where health systems’ capacity is digitally and conveniently accessible to all market constituents. The combination of R1 and SCI is expected to deliver enhanced value for healthcare providers by enabling them to expand digital front door strategies for their patients, improve operating efficiency, and increase capacity utilization, among other benefits. The aggregate purchase price consisted of $190 million in cash, which was adjusted pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement for estimated cash and working capital at the closing of the transaction, and is subject to a post-closing adjustment process. We will also be required to make an additional earn-out payment of $10 million if certain financial and operational targets are met by April 30, 2021.
On June 26, 2019, we entered into a senior credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent and the lenders named therein for senior secured credit facilities consisting of a $325.0 million senior secured term loan facility (the “Senior Term Loan”) and a $100.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility. On March 20, 2020, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Credit Agreement (the “Amendment”), pursuant to which the lenders named in the Amendment agreed to provide an additional $191.1 million incremental delayed-draw term loan facility (the “Incremental Term Loan”) on the same terms as its existing Senior Term Loan provided under the Credit Agreement.
The Incremental Term Loan was drawn substantially concurrently with the acquisition of SCI. The proceeds of the Incremental Term Loan were used to fund the purchase price for SCI and related expenses. The Incremental Term Loan has terms consistent with those of the Senior Term Loan, including with respect to interest, maturity, amortization and prepayments and has the same affirmative and negative covenants and events of default as those applicable to the Senior Term Loan under the Credit Agreement.
RevWorks Acquisition
On August 3, 2020, we completed the acquisition of the RevWorks services business pursuant to an asset purchase agreement dated as of June 2, 2020 (the “RevWorks Purchase Agreement”) by and among the Company and Cerner Corporation (the “RevWorks Acquisition”). At the closing of the transaction, we purchased certain assets relating to the RevWorks services business, as specified in the RevWorks Purchase Agreement. The combination of R1 and RevWorks is expected to provide enhanced revenue cycle capabilities and expertise to RevWorks clients, helping drive sustainable financial improvements for providers while improving their patients’ overall experience.
EMS Disposition
On July 19, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to dispose of our emergency medical services (“EMS”) business, including EMS Revenue Cycle Management and Electronic Patient Care Reporting (the “EMS Disposition”) for $140 million, inclusive of a $5 million hold-back amount subject to the completion of certain transition services, to be paid approximately one year from the date of the disposition. On October 30, 2020, we completed the EMS Disposition. We recognized a gain on the sale of $55.7 million, which is subject to completion of customary working capital adjustments.
Coronavirus Pandemic
In March 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. Restrictions on businesses and travel are occurring based on state and local guidelines and vary by locality and cannot be reasonably predicted.
Given the ongoing challenges associated with efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19 and related business impact for our customers, we initiated a number of actions in 2020 to ensure (1) the health and safety of our workforce and (2) uninterrupted and, in many respects, expanded support for our customers and the patients and communities they serve. Our efforts to date include: restricting all non-essential domestic and international travel; repositioning more than 15,000 global employees to a work-from-home operating environment; offering free COVID-19 testing and telemedicine visits; expanding paid time off for employees impacted by low work volumes; providing appreciation bonuses to our front-line, patient-facing services employees; launching a new remote patient registration tool to minimize contact between patients and registration staff and conserve personal protective equipment; leveraging capabilities acquired via our SCI acquisition to assist customers with processes to restart elective procedure scheduling; developing reporting to allow for detailed COVID-19 order tracking, scheduling, and follow-up; offering in-depth regulatory analysis and guidance for our customers given numerous changes to healthcare regulatory federal and state rules; and providing customers with operational best practices for implementation and revenue cycle management of telehealth services.
We have been able to partially offset the revenue pressure faced during the year ended December 31, 2020 by implementing measures to control costs and cash spending, including freezing hiring for non-critical roles, reducing non-COVID-related and non-SCI-related capital expenditures, eliminating discretionary spending, and suspending our 401(k) match and non-essential travel for the remainder of 2020. We are deferring our payroll tax remittances to the federal government as allowed under the CARES Act, allowing us to shift cash outflows from 2020 to 2021 and 2022. In addition, we are receiving an employee retention credit for allowable payroll expenses in conjunction with the CARES Act. We have also accelerated corporate cost savings initiatives that were originally planned for the fourth quarter into the second and third quarters. We have conducted a comprehensive review of our cost structure and capital expenditure needs, which have contributed to our cost control measures that we have implemented and continue to implement. As we navigate the uncertainties of the pandemic, our focus has been on the health and safety of our employees, while balancing long-term growth opportunities with short-term challenges.
Given the ongoing impact of the pandemic, there continues to be decreased patient volumes for our customers. We have continued to employ our full customer-facing workforce, even during lower patient volumes, because it is important to have that capacity available to serve our customers as volumes return. We anticipate continued volume constraints and corresponding revenue pressure associated with the pandemic. Despite the impacts of the pandemic, we have executed on inorganic growth opportunities, including beginning our integrations of both SCI and RevWorks. 
The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is fluid and continues to evolve. We cannot predict the extent to which our business, results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity will ultimately be impacted. However, we continue to assess its impact on our business and are actively managing our response. For further details on the potential impact of COVID-19 on our business, refer to “Risk Factors,” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Relationship with Ascension
On February 16, 2016, we entered into a long-term strategic partnership with Ascension Health Alliance, the parent of our largest customer and the nation’s largest Catholic and non-profit health system, and TowerBrook Capital Partners (“TowerBrook”), an investment management firm. As part of the transaction, we amended and restated our Master Professional Services Agreement (“A&R MPSA”) with Ascension Health (“Ascension”) effective February 16, 2016 with a term of ten years. Pursuant to the A&R MPSA and with certain limited exceptions, we are the exclusive provider of RCM services and PAS with respect to acute care services provided by the hospitals affiliated with Ascension that execute supplement agreements with us. In addition, at the close of the transaction, we issued to TCP-ASC ACHI Series LLLP, a limited liability limited partnership jointly owned by Ascension Health Alliance and investment funds affiliated with TowerBrook (“Investor”): (i) 200,000 shares of our 8.00% Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Series A Preferred Stock”) for an aggregate price of $200 million and (ii) a warrant with a term of ten years to acquire up to 60 million shares of our common stock, par value $0.01 per share, at an exercise price of $3.50 per share, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Warrant Agreement (“the Warrant”). The Series A Preferred Stock was immediately convertible into shares of common stock. We refer herein to the foregoing transactions consummated on February 16, 2016 with the Investor and Ascension as the “Transaction”.
On and effective as of June 24, 2018, we and Ascension entered into a supplement (the “Supplement”) to the A&R MPSA. Pursuant to the Supplement, the Company will provide RCM services for physician groups that receive services from Ascension’s National Revenue Service Center and other groups associated with Ascension hospital systems. Each such physician group will be required to execute an addendum to the Supplement for those physician groups to receive services under the Supplement. Ascension has agreed that the Company may provide services to additional physician groups affiliated with or acquired by Ascension over time. The Supplement also provides for the re-badging of certain centrally-based revenue cycle operations employees who support Ascension’s physician groups.
On January 15, 2021, the Investor converted all of its 294,266 shares (the “Current Shares”) of Preferred Stock into 117,706,400 shares of common stock of the Company into which the Current Shares were convertible pursuant to the Certificate of Designation of the Series A Preferred Stock, and, in consideration therefor, the Company (i) issued 21,582,800 additional shares of common stock, and (ii) paid the Investor $105.0 million in cash.
Customers
Our customers typically are healthcare providers, including health systems, hospitals, and physician groups. We seek to develop strategic, long-term relationships with our customers and focus on providers that we believe understand the value of our operating model and have demonstrated success in both the provision of healthcare services and the ability to achieve financial and operational results.
Hospital systems affiliated with Ascension have accounted for a significant portion of our net services revenue each year since our formation. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, net services revenue from healthcare providers affiliated with Ascension accounted for 64%, 67% and 69% of our total net services revenue, respectively. 
Customer Agreements
We generally provide our RCM offering pursuant to managed services agreements with our customers. In rendering our services, we must comply with customer policies and procedures regarding charity care, personnel, data security, compliance, and risk management, as well as applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations. Our end-to-end RCM agreements typically span two to ten years (subject to the parties' respective termination rights). In general, our end-to-end RCM agreements provide that:
•we are required to staff a sufficient number of our own employees commensurate with the service offering and provide the technology necessary to implement and manage our services;
•in our operating partner relationship model, we are responsible for providing all revenue cycle personnel, technology, and process workflow;
•a portion of our fees are tied to the achievement of certain financial or operating metrics; and
•the parties provide representations and indemnities to each other. 
Our agreements for modular solutions generally vary in length between one and three years. Customers pay a contractually negotiated fee for these services on a fixed fee, per-use, or volumetric basis and, in certain cases, a portion of our fees are tied to the achievement of certain metrics.
Sales and Marketing
Our new business opportunities are generated by our sales and marketing team and other members of our senior management team. Our customer acquisition process utilizes traditional and non-traditional techniques to inform the marketplace of R1’s solutions. Broad outreach and interest are turned into selling opportunities through demand generation programs and a marketing-sales pipeline management process. Initial interaction with a prospective healthcare provider begins with a key decision maker reporting to executive management. The initial interaction begins by comparing the potential customer’s historical and projected results versus a standardized improvement model. The next step is a more detailed assessment of the prospect’s existing operations versus our RCM model and a review of the potential opportunities. We begin negotiations with a standardized contract that is customized, as necessary, after collaborative discussions of operational and management issues and our proposed working relationship. Our sales process for RCM managed services agreements typically lasts six to 18 months from the introductory meeting to the agreement’s execution, while our sales process for our modular solutions typically lasts three to six months.
Technology and Products
Technology and Product Development
Our technology and product development process begins with interaction with the marketplace and understanding of healthcare providers’ and patients’ needs and challenges. Our product management team, working closely with our operations teams, leads these efforts with product development operations facilities in the United States and India. We continue to invest in the improvement of our technology and products in order to enhance the services that we provide our customers. We devote substantial resources to our development efforts and plan at an annual, quarterly, and monthly release level. We employ a structured system to assess the impact that potential new technologies, products, or enhancements will have on net services revenue, costs, efficiency, and customer satisfaction. The results of this analysis are evaluated in conjunction with our overall corporate goals when making development decisions. In addition to our technology and products development team, our operations personnel play an integral role in setting technology and product priorities in support of their objective of keeping our software operating 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
A key location for continued evolution of our technology is our R1 Technology & Innovation Center. Located in Salt Lake City, Utah, the 30,000 square foot facility was created to evaluate, test, and design new RCM technologies for health systems, hospitals, and physician groups, as well as serve as a client experience center. We use this hub to foster innovation in cutting-edge areas such as the use of robotic process automation to help address high-value and currently unsolved RCM challenges associated with the cost to collect, denials management, and improving the patient’s financial experience. 
Another way we accumulate valuable intellectual property that extends our value proposition and competitive advantage is to selectively acquire leading companies in segments most pertinent to solving our customers’ high-value problems. As an example, in 2020 we acquired SCI, and began consolidating its technology capability with ours to create a more comprehensive patient and provider self-service platform. We will continue to assess what new capabilities could be of value to our customers, and plan to regularly evaluate whether we are best suited to develop those capabilities internally, or to obtain them through acquisition of other market-leading technology solution companies.
Proprietary Software Suite
Our integrated suite of RCM technology provides a layer of analytics, rules processing, and workflow capabilities that interface with provider systems to optimize process efficiency and effectiveness. These technologies power the detection of defects on patient accounts and enable staff workflow at point of service areas, customer sites, and our global business services operations. Our technology suite includes but is not limited to:
•“R1 Access” powers workflow in customer central business offices and at our scaled global business services centers for pre-registration, financial clearance, and financial counseling. The platform processes patient accounts through proprietary rules engines tuned to identify defects in demographic data, authorization processes, insurance benefits and eligibility, and medical necessity. Our rules engines in R1 Access are also used to calculate patient cost estimates and prior balance accounts receivables. For the uninsured, the platform helps staff triage patients to find coverage for their visit. Our technology enables staff to work on an exception basis eliminating the need for manual intervention on accounts with no exceptions identified.
•“R1 Link” delivers all of the insight and defect detection capabilities of our proprietary rules engines in real-time to point of service emergency department and registration areas within healthcare organizations. When defects or inconsistent data are detected in the data entry or registration process, users receive targeted messages alerting them to resolve the issue while the patient is still in front of them.
•“R1 Contact,” our patient contact application, provides the workflow and data for patient contact center representatives. It enables effective financial discussions with patients on outstanding balances. The platform is integrated into our call center, call-routing and auto-dialer capabilities, and facilitates improved outcomes through propriety process and technology approaches.
•“R1 Insight,” our proprietary contract modeling platform, is used to accurately calculate the maximum allowed reimbursement for each claim based upon models of our customer's contract with each payer. This platform is used to provide insight into the health of payer contracts and to power portions of the workflow tools described above.
•“R1 Analytics,” our web-based reporting and analytics platform, produces over 300 proprietary reports derived from the financial, process, and productivity data that we accumulate as a result of our services, which enable us to monitor and identify areas for improvement in the efficacy of our RCM services.
•“R1 Decision” classifies defects in a proprietary nomenclature and distributes data to back end teams for follow up and resolution according to standard operating processes. Defects are identified and noted on accounts as they occur. The platform, along with our “Yield-Based Follow Up” application, is designed to power customer patient financial services departments and our global business services.
•“R1 Physician Advisor” assists our customers in the initiation of a service request by our PAS team. Our platform allows for the electronic submission, tracking, reviewing, and auditing of patient cases referred to us. The PAS portal environment is established as a secure site that enables us to receive patient records from customer case managers and route them to our physicians for review. This workflow is supported by an analytics engine within the web portal that provides our customers the ability to improve their compliance and workflow with our real time reporting, dashboards, and worklists.
•“R1 Patient Experience” (“R1 PX”) streamlines the interface for patients and physicians with the revenue cycle across all settings of care. It includes enterprise scheduling, self-service appointment management, patient out-of-pocket cost estimation, online pre-registration, financial clearance, authorization automation, and patient payment. The technology includes web-based, mobile-responsive applications for patient and provider self-service, which are all connected to R1’s proprietary rules engines. These rules engines automate the complex tasks necessary to prevent revenue cycle defects, and with the addition of SCI technology, now also automate the matching of appropriate provider appointment capacity with specific patient needs under any variety of clinical and administrative circumstances.
•“R1 Automate” provides robotic process automation, data aggregation from disparate sources, desktop automation, and other technologies to automate work. With this technology, repetitive transactional processes are automated, delivering operating efficiency and freeing up staff members to focus on higher-order problem solving and higher value-added work. The solutions target a wide range of functions including prior authorization, coding, accounts receivable follow-up, payment posting, and credit balances, among others.
•“R1 Chart Manager” supports patient medical record deficiency management, by evaluating record completeness and optimizing the chart completion workflow. The application creates an intuitive user experience, queuing work by defect and providing visibility to work in process. It allows hand-offs across departments, and tracking of accountability for chart completion, in order to drive velocity and accuracy of the medical record management and coding processes. Customers generally experience improved unbilled AR days and faster cash collection by utilizing the technology.
•“R1 Post” supports the end-to-end cash posting function, including the matching of bank deposits to remittance advices, initiating the posting of the remittance advices within a client’s patient accounting system, balancing these transactions, and providing financial reporting. With this technology, unmatched deposits/remittances or unbalanced transactions are able to be worked on an exception-basis.
•“R1 QA Suite” provides a standardized technology for performing quality assurance across the various operational verticals. The technology provides audit workflow, statistically-driven sampling, domain-specific audit templates, and alerting/staff feedback gathering functionality. 
These proprietary technology applications run on an integrated platform built on a modern, event-driven architecture and rules engines that enhance integration of systems and operational workflows. Our applications are deployed on a highly-scalable architecture based upon Microsoft and other industry leading platforms. We offer a common experience for end-users and believe the consistent look and feel of our applications allows our customers and staff to use our software suite quickly and easily. 
Technology Operations
Our software interacts with our customers’ software through a series of real-time and batch interfaces. We do not require changes to the customer’s core patient care delivery or financial systems. Instead of installing hardware or software in customer locations or data centers, we specify the information that a customer needs to extract from its existing systems in order to interface with our systems. This methodology enables our systems to operate with many combinations of customer systems, including custom and industry-standard implementations. 
When these interfaces are in place, we provide a holistic application suite across the healthcare provider's revenue cycle. For our purposes, the revenue cycle starts when a patient registers for future service or arrives at a hospital or clinic for unscheduled service, and ends when the healthcare organization has collected all the appropriate revenue from all possible sources. Thus, we provide eligibility, address validation, skip tracing, charge capture, patient and payer follow-up, analytics and tracking, charge master management, contract modeling, contract “what if” analysis, collections, and other functions throughout the customer’s revenue cycle. 
Our core RCM and PAS applications are hosted within enterprise-class, industry-leading, third-party data centers located in Dallas, TX and Ashburn, VA. Our internal financial application suite is hosted in various locations in a U.S.-based cloud model. The third-party partners we use for hosting are compliant with the Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements, or SSAE, No. 16, Reporting on Controls at a Service Organization (Service Organization Controls 1). We have agreements with our hardware and system software suppliers for support 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Our operations personnel also use our resources located in our other U.S. facilities, as well as our India facilities.
Data and information regarding our customers’ patients reside within the continental U.S. data centers and is encrypted both when transmitted over the internet and at-rest. We have dedicated links for data replication between our primary and secondary production data centers for resiliency and redundancy. We also have data backups that occur at appropriate intervals.
If a combination of events were to cause a system failure, we would follow our IT incident management and IT disaster-recovery processes to isolate the failure and restore services. We believe that no combination of failures by our systems can impact a customer’s ability to deliver patient care because our systems run parallel to the client’s host system, which is the system of record for all patient-related information.
Our third-party data centers are designed to withstand many catastrophic events such as blizzards, hurricanes, and power grid anomalies. To protect against a catastrophic event where our primary data center is destroyed and service cannot be completely restored within a few days, we continuously replicate our data from our primary data center to our secondary data center. In addition, we store backups of our virtual servers, applications, and databases off-site, which would be utilized to make our systems and IT infrastructure operational. We would re-establish operations by pointing to secondary data-center servers and, where appropriate, restoring data from the off-site backups and re-establishing connectivity with our customers’ host systems. There would be minimal changes needed on the customer host systems, and no changes on customer workstations would need to be made for customers to reconnect to our systems.
Digital Transformation Office
In November 2018, we launched a Digital Transformation Office (“DTO”) to systematically automate our transactional environment on an end-to-end basis. The DTO's three principal objectives are: (1) digitization of the patient and physician interface with the revenue cycle; (2) automation of manual tasks using robotic process automation technology; and (3) using advanced data analysis methods to improve complex revenue cycle processes such as denials via machine learning and predictive modeling. The original pipeline of automation was delivered between the launch and the second quarter of 2020. The Automation Center of Excellence, established as part of the DTO, continues to uncover opportunities for both net new automations and extending existing automations to capture incremental value. The Automation Center of Excellence is charged with developing automation solutions beyond the original pipeline, and we believe there are substantial opportunities for additional automation over the short, medium, and long-term.
Information Security
Our priority is protecting our customers' confidential and protected health information (“PHI”). Our security strategy employs various best practices, multi-layered defenses, and relevant technologies designed to control, audit, monitor, and protect access to sensitive information. Our senior officers, including the Chief Information Officer and Chief Information Security Officer, are responsible for the operation of our information security program and regularly communicate with the Compliance & Risk Management Board Committee on the program, including with respect to the state of the program, compliance with applicable regulations, current and evolving threats, and recommendations for changes in the information security program. In addition, the Audit Committee monitors cybersecurity as it relates to financial and reporting systems and controls. As part of the information security program we employ a National Institute of Standards Technology (“NIST”) based cybersecurity strategy and framework with real-time monitoring, active testing protocols, and continual workforce training. Further, we rigorously investigate cybersecurity risks and threats to address and ensure mitigation, resolution, and process improvement efforts in a timely manner. 
With our comprehensive, cross-functional approach, we have received and maintained certification from the Health Information Trust (“HITRUST”) Alliance since January 2013. The HITRUST Common Security Framework (“CSF”), the most widely adopted framework in the healthcare industry, provides a comprehensive set of baseline security controls that leverage nationally and internationally accepted standards, including ISO, NIST, PCI, HIPAA, and COBIT. Our HITRUST certification validates our continued commitment to compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, and the regulations that have been issued under it, such as the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH Act (“HITECH”) and OMNIBUS regulations, which we collectively refer to as “HIPAA”, and to state-specific security and privacy laws regarding the creation, access, storage, or exchange of protected health information (“PHI”) and financial information. With continual receipt of HITRUST CSF Certified Status, we believe we are recognized as meeting key healthcare regulations and requirements for protecting and securing sensitive private healthcare information and appropriately managing risk.
Competition
The market for our solutions is highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future. We believe that competition for the services we provide is based primarily on the following factors:
•knowledge and understanding of the complex healthcare payment and reimbursement system in the United States;
•a track record of delivering revenue improvements and efficiency gains for healthcare organizations while enhancing patient satisfaction;
•predictable and measurable results;
•the ability to deliver a solution that is fully-integrated along each step of a healthcare organization's revenue cycle operations;
•cost-effectiveness, including the breakdown between up-front costs and pay-for-performance incentive compensation;
•reliability, simplicity, and flexibility of technology platforms;
•understanding of the healthcare industry’s regulatory environment; and
•sufficient and scalable infrastructure and financial stability.
We face competition from various sources, including other end-to-end RCM providers and the internal RCM departments of healthcare organizations. Healthcare providers that previously have made internal investments in their RCM departments sometimes choose to continue to rely on their own internal RCM staff.
We also compete with several categories of external market participants, most of which focus on specific components of the healthcare revenue cycle. External market participants include:
•software vendors and other technology-supported RCM business process outsourcing companies;
•traditional consultants; and
•information technology outsourcers.
These types of external participants also compete with us in the field of modular solutions. 
Although we believe that there are barriers to replicating our end-to-end RCM solution, competition may intensify in the future. Other companies may develop superior or more economical service offerings that healthcare providers could find more attractive than our offerings. Moreover, the regulatory landscape may shift in a direction that is more strategically advantageous to existing and future competitors.
Government Regulation 
The customers we serve are subject to a complex array of federal and state laws and regulations. These laws and regulations may change rapidly and unpredictably, and it is frequently unclear how they apply to our business. We devote significant efforts, through training of personnel and monitoring, to establish and maintain compliance with all regulatory requirements that we believe are applicable to our business and the services we offer.
Government Regulation of Health Information
Privacy and Security Regulations. The Administrative Simplification Provisions of HIPAA and implementing regulations contain substantial restrictions and requirements with respect to the use and disclosure of a subset of individually identifiable health information, referred to as PHI and require covered entities, including health plans, health care clearinghouses, and most health care providers, to implement administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of electronic PHI maintained or transmitted by them or by others on their behalf.
Certain provisions of the privacy and security regulations promulgated pursuant to HIPAA apply to business associates (entities that perform functions on behalf of, or provide services to, covered entities involving the handling of PHI), and business associates are subject to direct liability for violation of these provisions. Violations of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations may result in criminal penalties and in substantial civil penalties per violation. The civil penalties are adjusted annually based on updates to the consumer price index. In addition, a covered entity may be subject to penalties as a result of a business associate violating HIPAA, if the business associate is found to be an agent of the covered entity. Most of our customers are covered entities and we are a business associate to many such customers under HIPAA as a result of our contractual obligations to perform certain functions on behalf of, and provide certain services to, those customers. As a business associate, we sometimes also act as a clearinghouse in performing certain functions for our customers. 
In order to provide our covered entity customers with services that involve the use or disclosure of PHI, HIPAA requires our customers to enter into business associate agreements with us. Such business associate agreements among other things, (i) dictate how we may use and disclose PHI, (ii) require us to implement reasonable administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect PHI from misuse, (iii) report security incidents and other improper uses or disclosures of PHI, and (iv) impose these same obligations through agreements with our agents and subcontractors that have access to PHI.
Transaction Requirements. In addition to privacy and security requirements, HIPAA also requires that certain electronic transactions related to healthcare billing be conducted using uniform electronic data transmission standards and code sets for certain health care claims and payment transactions submitted or received electronically. We are contractually required to structure and provide our services in a way that supports our customers’ HIPAA compliance obligations. 
Data Security and Breaches. In recent years, there have been well-publicized data breach incidents involving the improper dissemination of personal health and other information of individuals, both within and outside of the healthcare industry. Covered entities must report breaches of unsecured PHI to affected individuals without unreasonable delay but not to exceed 60 days after discovery of the breach by a covered entity or its agents. Notification also must be made to the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (“HHS”) and, in certain situations involving large breaches, to the media. HHS is required to publish on its website a list of all covered entities that report a breach involving more than 500 individuals. Impermissible uses or disclosures of unsecured PHI are presumed to be breaches unless the covered entity or business associate establishes that there is a low probability that the unsecured PHI has been compromised. Various state laws and regulations also may require us to notify affected individuals in the event of a data breach involving individually identifiable information. In many cases, these state laws are limited to electronic data, but states are increasingly enacting or considering stricter and broader requirements. In addition, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) uses its consumer protection authority to initiate enforcement actions in response to data breaches. We have implemented and maintain physical, technical, and administrative safeguards intended to protect all personal data, and have processes in place to assist us in complying with applicable laws and regulations regarding the protection of this data and properly responding to any security incidents and data breaches.
State Laws. In addition to HIPAA, most states have enacted patient confidentiality laws that protect against the unauthorized disclosure of confidential medical information, and many states have adopted or are considering further legislation in this area, including privacy safeguards, security standards, and data security breach notification requirements. Such state laws, if more stringent than HIPAA requirements, are not preempted by the federal requirements, and we must comply with them even though they may be subject to different interpretations by various courts and other governmental authorities. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the “CCPA”) affords consumers expanded privacy protections effective January 1, 2020. The potential effects of this legislation are far-reaching and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses to comply. For example, the CCPA gives California residents expanded rights to access and require deletion of their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches.
Other Requirements. In addition to HIPAA, there are numerous other laws and legislative and regulatory initiatives at the federal and state levels addressing privacy and security concerns. We and our customers may be subject to any federal or state privacy-related laws that are more restrictive than the privacy regulations issued under HIPAA. These laws vary and could impose additional penalties. The FTC has issued guidance for, and several states have issued or are considering new regulations to require, holders of certain types of personally identifiable information to implement formal policies and programs to prevent, detect, and mitigate the risk of identity theft and other unauthorized access to or use of such information. Further, federal and state legislation has been proposed, and through rule making or executive action, several states have taken action, to restrict or discourage the disclosure of medical or other personally identifiable information to individuals or entities located outside of the United States.
International Laws. In addition to data privacy and security statutes in the United States, the European Union (“EU”) introduced the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (“GDPR”). GDPR became applicable on May 25, 2018, and applies to our activities conducted from an establishment in the EU or any targeting activities toward the EU. GDPR creates an enhanced range of compliance obligations, including duties as to privacy notices, legal bases for processing, data retention, data security, and rights for individuals. Additionally, GDPR significantly increases financial penalties for non-compliance, including possible fines of up to 4% of global annual turnover for the preceding financial year or €20 million (whichever is higher) for the most serious infringements. The extent to which our activities conducted from an establishment in the UK or targeting activities toward the UK remain subject to the same or similar requirements as GDPR depends upon how the UK chooses to regulate privacy and data security now that the UK has left the EU. 
Government Regulation of Reimbursement
Our customers are subject to regulation by a number of governmental agencies, including those that administer the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Accordingly, our customers are sensitive to legislative and regulatory changes in, and limitations on, the government healthcare programs and changes in reimbursement policies, processes, and payment rates. During recent years, there have been numerous federal legislative and administrative actions that have affected government programs, including adjustments that have reduced or increased payments to physicians and other healthcare providers and adjustments that have affected the complexity of our work. For example, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (“MACRA”) established a Quality Payment Program (“QPP”) that requires physician groups to track and report a multitude of data relating to quality, clinical practice improvement activities, use of an electronic health record, and cost. Success or failure with respect to these measures may impact reimbursement in future years. Similarly, in 2021, hospitals participating in the Medicare Value-Based Purchasing Program, which requires the reporting of quality and cost measures, may receive a net decrease in payments of up to 1.62%. It is possible that the federal or state governments will implement additional reductions, increases, or changes in reimbursement in the future under government programs that adversely affect our customer base or increase the cost of providing our services. Any such changes could adversely affect our own financial condition by reducing the reimbursement rates of our customers.
Fraud and Abuse Laws
A number of health care fraud and abuse laws apply to hospitals, physicians, and others who (i) furnish health care services to patients and submit claims for reimbursement to government programs and/or commercial insurers, and (ii) refer patients to one another. Given the breadth of these laws, they may affect our business, either directly or because they apply to our customers. These laws and regulations include:
False Claims Laws. There are numerous federal and state laws that forbid (i) submitting a false claim, (ii) causing the submission of a false claims, (iii) retaining a known overpayment, or (iv) engaging in similar types of conduct. The federal civil False Claims Act (“FCA”), 31 U.S.C. §3729 et seq., for example, prohibits (i) knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval, or (ii) knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim. Further, under its so-called “reverse false clams” provision, the federal FCA imposes liability on any person who knowingly conceals or knowingly and improperly avoids or decreases an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the government. An obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the government, in turn, may arise if a person identifies an overpayment and fails to report and return the overpayment to the government within 60 days. Violations of the FCA may result in treble damages and per claim fines ranging from $11,665 to $22,331. The FCA may be enforced by the government or by private whistleblowers under the “qui tam” provisions of the statute. Whistleblowers are entitled to a share of any recovery in an FCA case. Other federal laws, such as those governing the imposition of civil monetary penalties, 42 U.S.C. §1320a-7a, prohibit similar conduct, as do many state laws.
Anti-Kickback Laws. There are numerous federal and state laws that prohibit one person from providing anything of value to another person if one purpose of the arrangement is to induce the payee to refer patients or other business to the payor for services that are covered by a government program (or, in the case of some state laws, a commercial insurer). For example, the federal health care program anti-kickback statute (“AKS”), 42 U.S.C. §1320a-7b(b), prohibits one person from “knowingly and willfully” offering or paying any “remuneration” to another person to induce the recipient to (i) refer an individual for the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of any item or service for which payment may be made in whole or in part under Medicare, Medicaid, or any other federal health care program, or (ii) purchase, lease, order, or arrange for or recommend purchasing, leasing, or ordering any good, facility, service, or item for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a federal health care program. The AKS also prohibits a person from soliciting or receiving remuneration in exchange for engaging in any of these activities. Violation of the AKS can result in imprisonment, fines, exclusion from participation in federal health care programs (“program exclusion”), and exposure under the FCA. Many states have adopted anti-inducement laws similar to the AKS. In some cases, these state laws are narrower than the federal AKS (applying only to certain categories of persons, such as physicians). In other cases, the state laws are broader than the federal AKS (covering inducements to refer not only government program patients and business but commercially insured patients and business as well).
Physician Self-Referral Laws. Under the federal physician self-referral law (or “Stark Law”), 42 U.S.C. §1395nn, if a physician (or one or his or her immediate family members) has a financial relationship with a health care provider (such as a hospital), then, in the absence of an applicable exception (i) the physician may not refer Medicare beneficiaries to that provider for certain so-called “designated health services,” and (ii) in the event of such a referral, the provider may not bill Medicare, the beneficiary, or any other person for those services. Violations of the referral and billing prohibitions of the Stark Law can result in civil monetary penalties, program exclusion, and exposure under the FCA. Many states have their own physician self-referral laws. These state laws vary widely, in some cases being narrower, and in other cases broader, than the Stark Law. 
Health care fraud and abuse laws, such as those described above, apply to many of our customers and, under some circumstances, could apply to us. Although we believe that our practices and our customers’ practices are generally in compliance with these laws, we cannot be certain that governmental officials or others will not assert otherwise.
Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act
The federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (“EMTALA”) was enacted to ensure public access to emergency services regardless of a patient’s insurance status or ability to pay. Specifically, EMTALA requires Medicare-participating hospitals to conduct an appropriate medical screening examination of every individual who presents to the hospital’s emergency room for treatment. If the individual is suffering from an emergency medical condition, the hospital must either stabilize the condition or make an appropriate transfer of the individual to a facility able to handle the condition. The obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of an individual’s ability to pay for treatment. There are severe penalties under EMTALA if a hospital fails to screen or appropriately stabilize or transfer an individual or if the hospital delays appropriate treatment in order to first inquire about the individual’s ability to pay. Sanctions for violating EMTALA include program exclusion and civil monetary penalties. These civil monetary penalties are adjusted annually based on updates to the consumer price index. In addition, the law creates a private right of action for any individual who suffers personal harm as a direct result of a violation of the law. A hospital that suffers a financial loss as a direct result of another hospital’s violation of the law also has a similar right.
EMTALA generally applies to our customers that are Medicare-participating hospitals, and we assist our customers with the intake of their patients. Although we believe that our customers’ practices are generally in compliance with the law and applicable regulations, we cannot be certain that governmental officials or others will not assert that we or our customers are in violation of EMTALA nor can we predict what obligations may be imposed by regulations to be issued in the future.
Laws Limiting Assignment of Reimbursement Claims
Various federal and state laws limit whether and the extent to which claims for reimbursement from a government program can be assigned (by a patient to a provider) or reassigned (by one provider to another person). We do not believe that our customers reassign their claims for Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement to us. Any determination to the contrary, however, could adversely affect our ability to be paid for the services we provide to our customers, require us to restructure the manner in which we are paid, or have further regulatory consequences.
Regulation of Debt Collection Activities
The federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (“FDCPA”) regulates persons who regularly collect or attempt to collect, directly or indirectly, consumer debts owed or asserted to be owed to another person. Certain of our accounts receivable activities may be deemed to be subject to the FDCPA. The FDCPA establishes specific guidelines and procedures that debt collectors must follow in communicating with consumer debtors, including the time, place, and manner of such communications. Further, it prohibits harassment or abuse by debt collectors, including the threat of violence or criminal prosecution, obscene language, or repeated telephone calls made with the intent to abuse or harass. The FDCPA also places restrictions on communications with individuals other than consumer debtors in connection with the collection of any consumer debt and sets forth specific procedures to be followed when communicating with such third parties for purposes of obtaining location information about the consumer. In addition, the FDCPA contains various notice and disclosure requirements and prohibits unfair or misleading representations by debt collectors. Finally, the FDCPA imposes certain limitations on lawsuits to collect debts against consumers.
Debt collection activities are also regulated at the state level. Most states have laws regulating debt collection activities in ways that are similar to, and in some cases more stringent than, the FDCPA. In addition, some states require companies engaged in the collection of consumer debt to be licensed. In all states where we operate, we believe that we (1) currently hold all required licenses, (2) are in the process of requesting and retaining all applicable licenses, or, (3) are exempt from licensing.
We are also subject to the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”). In the process of communicating with our customers’ patients, we use a variety of communications methods. The TCPA places certain restrictions on companies that place telephone calls to consumers.
The FTC has the authority to investigate consumer complaints relating to the FDCPA and the TCPA, and to initiate or recommend enforcement actions, including actions to seek monetary penalties. State officials typically have authority to enforce corresponding state laws. In addition, affected consumers may bring suits, including class action suits, to seek monetary remedies (including statutory damages) for violations of the federal and state provisions discussed above.
Regulation of Credit Card Activities
We process, on behalf of our customers, credit card payments from their patients. Various federal and state laws impose privacy and information security laws and regulations with respect to the use of credit cards. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations or experience a credit card security breach, our reputation could be damaged, possibly resulting in lost future business, and we could be subjected to additional legal or financial risk as a result of non-compliance.
Foreign Regulations
Our international operations are subject to additional regulations that govern the creation, continuation, and winding up of companies, as well as the relationships between the shareholders, the company, the public, and the government.
Intellectual Property 
We rely upon a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws and contractual terms and conditions to protect our intellectual property rights, and have sought patent protection for aspects of our key innovations.
We have been issued four U.S. patents which expire between 2027 and 2030, upon payment of U.S. Patent maintenance fees, and two additional pending U.S. patent applications that relate to key domains of our R1 Access software suite: improving efficiency of client claims' reimbursement, follow-up, and measurement. Legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability, and scope of protection of patents can be uncertain. We do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims. Our patent applications may not result in the grant of patents with the scope of the claims that we seek, if at all, or the scope of the granted claims may not be sufficiently broad to protect our products and technology. Our four granted patents or any patents that may be granted in the future from pending or future applications may be opposed, contested, circumvented, designed around by a third party, or found to be invalid or unenforceable. Third parties may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our proprietary technologies, duplicate, or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technologies or design around patents owned or licensed by us. If our technology is found to infringe any patent or other intellectual property right held by a third party, we could be prevented from providing our service offerings and/or subjected to significant damage awards.
We also rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. We control access to and the use of our application capabilities through a combination of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, customers, contractors, and business partners. We license some of our software through agreements that impose specific restrictions on our customers’ ability to use the software, such as prohibiting reverse engineering and limiting the use of copies. We also require employees and contractors to sign non-disclosure agreements and invention assignment agreements to give us ownership of intellectual property developed in the course of working for us.
Consistent with common industry practices, we occasionally utilize open source software or third party software products to meet our clients' needs. 
Financial Information About Geographic Areas
    The majority of our customers are entities organized and located within the United States. See Note 7, Property, Equipment and Software, to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding the location of our long-lived assets. 
Human Capital Management 
In 2020, our Chief Executive Officer signed the CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion™ Pledge committing to act on supporting inclusive workplaces, and we continued our Inclusion & Diversity (“I&D”) Councils for both our U.S. and India offices. We held our first I&D Awareness Day and enhanced our bias awareness training and other offerings to address issues of culture competency and business ethics and integrity. We have also implemented a data-driven scorecard to advance our internal I&D efforts to systematically promote inclusion of diverse slates of candidates for Company hiring and promotion practices. We also set internal gender, racial, and ethnic diversity recruiting targets for incoming employees.
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 19,000 full-time employees, as well as approximately 1,200 part-time employees. Of these employees, approximately 9,500 full-time and 1,200 part-time employees were located in the U.S., and approximately 9,500 full-time employees were located internationally. Our employees are not represented by a labor union, and we consider our current employee relations to be good.
R1 recognizes that attracting, motivating, and retaining talent at all levels is vital to continuing our success. By improving employee retention and engagement, we also seek to improve our ability to support R1’s customers and protect the long-term interests of our stakeholders and stockholders. We invest in our employees through high-quality benefits and various health and wellness initiatives, and offer competitive compensation packages, which are also designed to ensure fairness in internal compensation practices. We adhere to our Code of Integrity, which emphasizes our four guiding compliance principles of integrity, accountability, collaboration, and vigilance. 
To further engage and incentivize our workforce, we provide a wide range of career development opportunities to support and motivate our employees to operate at their best and succeed. We offer a variety of learning and development resources for our employees, including but not limited to a role-based R1 Certification Program for our hourly staff to support market leading capabilities and an R1 Executive Leadership Experience program in partnership with the Northwestern University Kellogg School of Management to build the leadership capability of our VP and SVP leaders. For professional recognition of our associates, our R1 Stars program provides leaders and fellow associates the opportunity to recognize one another for their contributions, and our Innovation Challenge rewards teams who submit ideas that solve high-value customer business problems. 
We gauge our employees’ level of engagement and satisfaction by conducting engagement surveys with the assistance of a third-party. We also solicit feedback from employees about their people leader’s effectiveness and ability to foster I&D, career and development opportunities, benefits, well-being, and comfort in reporting behavior that does not align to our Code of Integrity. In 2020, 87% of more than 20,000 R1 associates participated in the engagement survey, and we are utilizing their direct input to proactively build ongoing career development and employee growth initiatives. 
Employee health, well-being, and safety is one of our top priorities. The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored for us the importance of keeping our employees safe and healthy. To prioritize employee health and safety, we took the following steps in 2020: restricted all non-essential domestic and international travel; repositioned more than 15,000 global employees to a work-from-home operating environment; offered free COVID-19 testing and telemedicine visits; expanded paid time off for employees impacted by low work volumes; provided appreciation bonuses to our front-line, patient-facing services employees; and provided virtual group coaching sessions for our people leaders to better enable their effectiveness in light of challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic.
At R1, we are committed to making a meaningful impact in our communities by focusing on community service and volunteerism related to health, education, and human services. Our Helping Hands program demonstrates our commitment to continue being a good corporate citizen everywhere we operate, serve, and live. We empower our employees to look beyond themselves and reach out to identify and address social issues in their communities. As a part of that commitment, we provide all employees with 16 hours of paid time off to participate in volunteer activities.
In March, 2021 we plan to release our 2020 Environmental, Social, and Governance (“ESG”) Report, which will be available on our website. We encourage you to review this report for more detailed information regarding our Human Capital programs and initiatives. Nothing on our website, including our 2020 ESG Report or sections thereof, shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report.
