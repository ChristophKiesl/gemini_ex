Overview 
 
We are a television broadcasting and digital media company focused on the acquisition, development and operation of television stations and interactive community websites and digital media services in medium-sized markets in the United States. 
 
As of December 31, 2016, we owned, operated, programmed or provided sales and other services to 104 full power television stations, including those owned by VIEs with which we have local service agreements, in 62 markets in the states of Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New York, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia and Wisconsin. The stations are affiliates of ABC, NBC, FOX, CBS, The CW, MyNetworkTV and other broadcast television networks. Through various local service agreements, Nexstar provided sales, programming and other services to 30 full power television stations owned and/or operated by independent third parties. As of December 31, 2016, we reached approximately 20.8 million viewers or 18.1% of all U.S. television households.
 
On January 17, 2017, we completed the Merger with Media General. Media General owned, operated, or serviced 79 full power television stations in 48 markets, including 10 stations owned by VIEs. Substantially concurrent with the Merger, we sold the assets of 12 full power television stations in 12 markets, five of which were previously owned by us and seven of which were previously owned by Media General. Following these transactions, we own, operate, program or provide sales and other services to 171 full power television stations in 100 markets, reaching approximately 44.7 million viewers or nearly 39% of all U.S. television households.
 
We believe that medium-sized markets offer significant advantages over large-sized markets. First, because there are fewer well-capitalized acquirers with a medium-market focus, we have been successful in purchasing stations on more favorable terms than acquirers of large market stations. Second, in many of our markets only four to six local commercial television stations exist. As a result, we achieve lower programming costs than stations in larger markets because the supply of quality programming exceeds the demand. 
 
The stations we own and operate or provide services to provide free over-the-air programming to our markets’ television viewing audiences. This programming includes (a) programs produced by networks with which the stations are affiliated; (b) programs that the stations produce; and (c) first-run and rerun syndicated programs that the stations acquire. Our television stations’ primary sources of revenue include the sale of commercial air time on our stations to local and national advertisers, revenues earned from our retransmission consent agreements with cable, satellite and other multichannel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”) in our markets, and the sale of advertising on our websites in each of our broadcast markets where we deliver community focused content.
 
We seek to grow our revenue and operating income by increasing the audience and revenue shares of the stations we own, operate, program or provide sales and other services to, as well as through our growing portfolio of digital products and services. We strive to increase the audience share of the stations by creating a strong local broadcasting presence based on highly rated local news, local sports coverage and active community sponsorship. We seek to improve revenue share by employing and supporting a high-quality local sales force that leverages the stations’ strong local brands and community presence with local advertisers. We further improve broadcast cash flow by maintaining strict control over operating and programming costs. The benefits achieved through these initiatives are magnified in our duopoly markets by owning or providing services to stations affiliated with multiple networks, capitalizing on multiple sales forces and achieving an increased level of operational efficiency. As a result of our operational enhancements, we expect revenue from the stations we have acquired or begun providing services to in the last four years to grow faster than that of our more mature stations. 
 
Our digital media businesses provide digital publishing and content management platforms, a digital video advertising platform and other digital media solutions to media publishers and advertisers. We are focused on new technologies and growing our portfolio of digital products and services complementary to our vision of providing local news, entertainment and sports content through broadcast and digital platforms.
 
Our principal offices are at 545 E. John Carpenter Freeway, Suite 700, Irving, TX 75062. Our telephone number is (972) 373-8800 and our website is http://www.nexstar.tv.

Recent Acquisitions 
 
On November 16, 2015, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the assets of three CBS affiliated full power television stations and one NBC affiliated full power television station from West Virginia Media Holdings, LLC (“WVMH”) for $130.0 million in cash, plus working capital adjustments. The stations affiliated with CBS are WOWK in the Charleston-Huntington, West Virginia market, WTRF in the Wheeling, West Virginia-Steubenville, Ohio market and WVNS in the Bluefield-Beckley-Oak Hill, West Virginia market. WBOY in the Clarksburg-Weston, West Virginia market is affiliated with NBC. This acquisition allows us entrance into these markets. We began providing programming and sales services to these stations pursuant to a TBA effective December 1, 2015.
 
On January 4, 2016, we completed the first closing of the transaction and acquired the stations’ assets excluding certain transmission equipment, the FCC licenses and network affiliation agreements and paid $65.0 million, including a deposit paid upon signing the purchase agreement in November 2015 of $6.5 million, all funded through a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. On August 2, 2016, we became the primary beneficiary of our variable interests in WVMH’s stations upon receiving FCC approval to acquire their remaining assets. Therefore, we have consolidated these remaining assets under authoritative guidance related to the consolidation of VIEs as of this date. On January 31, 2017, we completed the second closing of this acquisition and paid the remaining purchase price of $65.0 million, plus working capital adjustments, funded by cash on hand. The TBA was terminated as of this date.
 
On February 1, 2016, we completed our acquisition of the assets of four full power television stations from Reiten Television, Inc. (“Reiten”) for $44.0 million in cash, funded by a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility. The purchase price includes the $2.2 million deposit that we paid upon signing the purchase agreement in September 2015. The stations, all affiliated with CBS at acquisition, are KXMA, KXMB, KXMC and KXMD in the Minot-Bismarck-Dickinson, North Dakota market. KXMA, KXMB and KXMD are satellite stations of KXMC.
 
On March 14, 2016, we completed our acquisition of the assets of KCWI, the CW affiliate in the Des Moines-Ames, Iowa market, from Pappas Telecasting of Iowa, LLC and paid $3.9 million in cash, including the deposit of $0.2 million paid upon signing the purchase agreement in October 2014.
 
Merger with Media General
 
On January 17, 2017, we completed our previously announced Merger with Media General pursuant to the Merger Agreement by and among Nexstar, Merger Sub, and Media General. Media General owned, operated, or serviced 79 full power television stations in 48 markets, including 10 stations owned by VIEs. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, upon the completion of the Merger, each issued and outstanding share of common stock, no par value, of Media General (“Media General Common Stock”) immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), other than shares or other securities representing capital stock in Media General owned, directly or indirectly, by us or any subsidiary of Media General, was converted into the right to receive (i) $10.55 in cash, without interest (the “Cash Consideration”), (ii) 0.1249 of a share of our Class A Common Stock (the “Nexstar Common Stock”), par value $0.01 per share (the “Stock Consideration”), and (iii) one non-tradeable CVR representing the right to receive a pro rata share of the net proceeds from the disposition of Media General’s spectrum in the FCC auction, reduced to account for the indirect benefit that such holder will receive as a shareholder of the combined company from (i) the net proceeds from the disposition of Nexstar’s spectrum in the FCC auction and (ii) the net proceeds from the disposition of Media General’s spectrum in the FCC auction, subject to and in accordance with the contingent value rights agreement governing the CVRs, which is incorporated by reference as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the CVR, together with the Stock Consideration and the Cash Consideration, the “Merger Consideration”). We anticipate to receive, later in 2017, an estimated $479.0 million of gross proceeds from the disposition of Media General’s spectrum in the FCC auction but we do not anticipate any disposition of Nexstar’s spectrum. The value of each CVR is estimated to be worth between $1.70 and $2.10 based on the estimated gross proceeds, less estimated transaction expenses, repacking expenses and taxes.
 
Upon the completion of the Merger, each unvested Media General stock option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time became fully vested and was converted into an option to purchase Nexstar Common Stock at the same aggregate price as provided in the underlying Media General stock option, with the number of shares of Nexstar Common Stock adjusted to account for the Cash Consideration and the exchange ratio for the Stock Consideration. Additionally, the holders of Media General stock options received one CVR for each share subject to the Media General stock option immediately prior to the Effective Time. All other equity-based awards of Media General outstanding immediately prior to the Merger vested in full and were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement.

Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the total consideration paid or issued on the Closing Date in connection with the Merger was as follows:
 
 
• | approximately $1.4 billion in cash payments;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | a total of 15,670,754 shares of Nexstar Common Stock with a fair value of approximately $1.0 billion and the reissuance of a total of 560,316 shares of Nexstar Common Stock held in treasury with a fair value of $35.6 million; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 228,438 stock option replacements with an estimated fair value of $10.7 million.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Simultaneously with the closing of the Merger, certain then-existing indebtedness of the Company and Media General was extinguished, including the Company’s term loans and revolving loans with a principal balance of $668.8 million and $2.0 million, respectively, and Media General’s outstanding term loans and senior unsecured notes with a principal balance of approximately $1.4 billion and $275.0 million, respectively. We inherited the $400.0 million 5.875% senior notes due 2022 (the “5.875% Notes”) issued by LIN Television Corporation, a Delaware corporation (“LIN TV”), which became our indirect subsidiary as of the Closing Date.
 
The Cash Consideration, the refinancing of the then-existing indebtedness of the Company and Media General, and the related fees and expenses were funded through a combination of cash on hand and new borrowings, including:
 
 
• | $2.75 billion in new senior secured Term Loan B due 2024 and payable in consecutive quarterly installments of 0.25% of the principal, with the remainder due at maturity;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | $51.3 million in new senior secured Term Loan A due 2018 and $318.7 million in new senior secured Term Loan A due 2022 both payable in quarterly installments that increase over time from 5.0% to 10.0%;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | $175.0 million in total commitments under new senior secured revolving credit facilities, of which $3.0 million was drawn at closing;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | $900.0 million from the issuance of the 5.625% senior unsecured notes due 2024 (the “5.625% Notes”) by Nexstar Broadcasting, as successor to Nexstar Escrow Corporation, our wholly-owned subsidiary (“Nexstar Escrow”); and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | $547.8 million in total consideration, plus working capital adjustments, from the previously announced sale of the assets of 12 full power television stations in 12 markets.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In respect of the aforementioned television station divestitures, we previously owned five of such stations and seven stations were previously owned by Media General. These divestitures were made to comply with the FCC’s local television ownership rule and the 39% U.S. television household national ownership cap. Our remaining commitments in connection with these transactions, including the bridge facility and the short-term facility totaling $530.0 million, were not funded and were consequently terminated upon closing of the Merger.
 
Also on the Closing Date, in connection with the Merger, we executed a Joinder to the Purchase Agreement, dated July 13, 2016, by and among Nexstar Escrow and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, as representative of the several initial purchasers, relating to the issuance and sale of the 5.625% Notes to such initial purchasers, pursuant to which Nexstar and certain of its subsidiaries became parties to the Purchase Agreement. On the Closing Date, we entered into a supplement to the indenture governing the 5.625% Notes, pursuant to which Nexstar Broadcasting assumed the obligations of Nexstar Escrow under such indenture and the 5.625% Notes, and we and Mission Broadcasting, Inc., a consolidated VIE, (“Mission”) provided guarantees under such indenture and the 5.625% Notes (subject to the definition of “Guarantee” in such indenture). Following the Merger, Nexstar Broadcasting, Nexstar, LIN TV, and The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee, entered into a supplemental indenture (the “5.875% Notes Third Supplemental Indenture”) to the indenture governing the 5.875% Notes, whereby Nexstar Broadcasting assumed the obligations of Media General as a guarantor under such indenture and Nexstar provided a guarantee of the 5.875% Notes (subject to the definition of “Guarantee” in the 5.875% Notes Third Supplemental Indenture). See Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15(a) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

5.625% Notes due 2024 | | 900,000 
 | $ | 5,223,000

Subsequent Debt Prepayment/Redemption
 On February 17, 2017, we prepaid $75.0 million of the outstanding principal balance under our Term Loan B, funded by cash on hand. 
 On February 27, 2017, we called the entire $525.0 million principal amount under our 6.875% senior unsecured notes due 2020 (“6.875% Notes”) at a redemption price equal to 103.438% of the principal plus any accrued and unpaid interest, funded by the new borrowings described above.
Operating Strategy 
 We seek to generate revenue and broadcast cash flow growth through the following strategies: 
 Develop Leading Local Franchises. Each of the stations that we own, operate, program, or provide sales and other services to creates a highly recognizable local brand, primarily through the quality of local news programming and community presence. Based on internally generated analysis, we believe that in over 78.0% of our markets in which we produce local newscasts, we rank among the top two stations in local news viewership. Strong local news typically generates higher ratings among attractive demographic profiles and enhances audience loyalty, which may result in higher ratings for programs both preceding and following the news. High ratings and strong community identity make the stations that we own, operate, program, or provide sales and other services to more attractive to local advertisers. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we earned approximately 31% of our advertising revenue from spots aired during local news programming. Currently, our stations and the stations we provide services to that produce local newscasts provide between 15 and 30 hours per week of local news programming. Extensive local sports coverage and active sponsorship of community events further differentiate us from our competitors and strengthen our community relationships and our local advertising appeal. 
 Invest in Digital Media. We are focused on new technologies and growing our portfolio of digital products and services. Our websites provide access to our local news and information, as well as community centric businesses and services. We delivered audience across all of our web sites in 2016, with 120 million unique visitors, who utilized over 687 million page views. Also in 2016, our mobile platform accounted for 77% of our overall page views by year end. We also launched redesigned web sites, ready for the emerging touch oriented platforms. We have also invested in additional digital media product lines, including a content management solution and a targeted video advertising platform. We are committed to serving our local markets by providing local content to both online and mobile users wherever and whenever they want.
 Emphasize Local Sales. We employ a high-quality local sales force in each of our markets to increase revenue from local advertisers by capitalizing on our investment in local programming and community websites. We believe that local advertising is attractive because our sales force is more effective with local advertisers, giving us a greater ability to influence this revenue source. Additionally, local advertising has historically been a more stable source of revenue than national advertising for television broadcasters. For the year ended December 31, 2016, revenue generated from local advertising represented 72.9% of our consolidated spot revenue (total of local and national advertising revenue, excluding political advertising revenue). In most of our markets, we have increased the size and quality of our local sales force. We also invest in our sales efforts by implementing comprehensive training programs and employing a sophisticated inventory tracking system to help maximize advertising rates and the amount of inventory sold in each time period. 

6

Operate Duopoly Markets. Owning or providing services to more than one station in a given market enables us to broaden our audience share, enhance our revenue share and achieve significant operating efficiencies. Duopoly markets broaden audience share by providing programming from multiple networks with different targeted demographics. These markets increase revenue share by capitalizing on multiple sales forces. Additionally, we achieve significant operating efficiencies by consolidating physical facilities, eliminating redundant management and leveraging capital expenditures between stations. We derived approximately 61.6% of our net revenue, excluding trade and barter revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2016 from our duopoly markets. 
 Maintain Strict Cost Controls. We emphasize strict controls on operating and programming costs in order to increase broadcast cash flow. We continually seek to identify and implement cost savings at each of our stations and the stations we provide services to and our overall size benefits each station with respect to negotiating favorable terms with programming suppliers and other vendors. By leveraging our size and corporate management expertise, we are able to achieve economies of scale by providing programming, financial, sales and marketing support to our stations and the stations we provide services to. 
 Capitalize on Diverse Network Affiliations. We currently own, operate, program, or provide sales and other services to a balanced portfolio of television stations with diverse network affiliations, including ABC, NBC, CBS and FOX affiliated stations which represented approximately 18.8%, 22.4%, 33.9% and 15.6%, respectively, of our 2016 combined local, national and political revenue. The networks provide these stations with quality programming and numerous sporting events such as NBA basketball, Major League baseball, NFL football, NCAA sports, PGA golf and the Olympic Games. Because network programming and ratings change frequently, the diversity of our station portfolio’s network affiliations reduces our reliance on the quality of programming from a single network. 
 Attract and Retain High Quality Management. We seek to attract and retain station general managers with proven track records in larger television markets by providing equity incentives not typically offered by other station operators in our markets. Most of our station general managers have been granted stock options and have an average of over 20 years of experience in the television broadcasting industry. 
Acquisition Strategy 
 We selectively pursue acquisitions of television stations where we believe we can improve revenue and cash flow through active management. When considering an acquisition, we evaluate the target audience share, revenue share, overall cost structure and proximity to our regional clusters. Additionally, we seek to acquire or enter into local service agreements with stations to create duopoly markets.
 The acquisition of Media General has significantly increased the Company’s national audience reach to a level that approaches national television ownership limits imposed by the Communications Act and FCC rules. This may restrict future television station acquisitions by the Company and may require the Company to divest current stations in connection with any future acquisition in order to comply with national television ownership limits.

7

Relationship with VIEs
 Through various local service agreements as of December 31, 2016, we provided sales, programming and other services to 29 full power television stations owned by consolidated VIEs and one full power television station owned by a VIE which is not consolidated. As of December 31, 2016, all of the VIEs and their stations are 100% owned by independent third parties. In compliance with FCC regulations for all the parties, the VIEs maintain complete responsibility for and control over programming, finances, personnel and operations of their stations. However, for the consolidated VIEs, we are deemed under U.S. GAAP to have controlling financial interests in these entities because of (1) the local service agreements Nexstar has with the consolidated VIEs’ stations, (2) Nexstar’s guarantee of the obligations incurred under Mission’s and Marshall’s senior secured credit facilities, (3) Nexstar having power over significant activities affecting the consolidated VIEs’ economic performance, including budgeting for advertising revenue, advertising sales and, for Mission, White Knight and Parker Broadcasting of Colorado, LLC (“Parker”), hiring and firing of sales force personnel and (4) purchase options granted by Mission, White Knight and Parker that permit Nexstar to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of each Mission, White Knight or Parker station, subject to FCC consent. These purchase options are freely exercisable or assignable by Nexstar without consent or approval by Mission, White Knight or Parker. These option agreements expire on various dates between 2017 and 2024. We expect to renew these option agreements upon expiration. Therefore, these VIEs are consolidated into these financial statements. 
 
As a result of the Merger, we began to provide sales, programming and other services to an additional 10 stations owned by VIEs with whom Media General had agreements. These VIEs are Shield Media, LLC (“Shield”), Vaughan Media, LLC (“Vaughan”), Tamer Media, LLC (“Tamer”) and Super Towers, Inc. (“Super Towers”). Nexstar became the primary beneficiaries of these VIEs as of the Closing Date because (1) the local service agreements Nexstar has with these VIEs’ stations, (2) Nexstar’s guarantee of the $24.8 million outstanding obligations under Shield’s senior secured credit facilities, (3) Nexstar having power over significant activities affecting the consolidated VIEs’ economic performance, including budgeting for advertising revenue, advertising sales and hiring and firing of sales force personnel and (4) purchase options granted by Shield, Vaughan, Tamer and Super Towers that permit Nexstar to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of each of these VIEs’ stations at any time, subject to FCC consent. Therefore, the financial results and financial position of these entities have been consolidated by the Nexstar in accordance with the VIE accounting guidance as of January 17, 2017.

On January 17, 2017, we completed the Merger with Media General. Media General owned, operated, or serviced 79 full power television stations in 48 markets. Substantially concurrent with the Merger, we sold the assets of 12 full power television stations in 12 markets, five of which were previously owned by us and seven of which were previously owned by Media General. Following these transactions, we own, operate, program or provide sales and other services to 171 full power television stations in 100 markets, reaching approximately 44.7 million viewers or nearly 39% of all U.S. television households. For additional information with respect to the Merger, refer to Item 1, “Business—Merger with Media General” and Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15(a) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Industry Background 
 Commercial television broadcasting began in the United States on a regular basis in the 1940s. A limited number of channels are available for over-the-air broadcasting in any one geographic area and a license to operate a television station must be granted by the FCC. All television stations in the country are grouped by The Nielsen Company, LLC, a national audience measuring service, into 210 generally recognized television markets, known as designated market areas (“DMAs”) that are ranked in size according to various metrics based upon actual or potential audience. Each DMA is an exclusive geographic area consisting of all counties in which the home-market commercial stations receive the greatest percentage of total viewing hours. Nielsen publishes data on estimated audiences for the television stations in each DMA on a quarterly basis. The estimates are expressed in terms of a “rating,” which is a station’s percentage of the total potential audience in the market, or a “share,” which is the station’s percentage of the audience actually watching television. A station’s rating in the market can be a factor in determining advertising rates. 
 Most television stations are affiliated with networks and receive a significant part of their programming, including prime-time hours, from networks. Whether or not a station is affiliated with one of the four major networks (NBC, CBS, FOX or ABC) has a significant impact on the composition of the station’s revenue, expenses and operations. Network programming is provided to the affiliate by the network in exchange for the payment to the network of affiliation fees and the network’s retention of a substantial majority of the advertising time during network programs. The network then sells this advertising time and retains the revenue. The affiliate retains the revenue from the remaining advertising time it sells during network programs and from advertising time it sells during non-network programs. 
 Broadcast television stations compete for advertising revenue primarily with other commercial broadcast television stations, cable and satellite television systems, the Internet and, to a lesser extent, with newspapers and radio stations serving the same market. Non-commercial, religious and Spanish-language broadcasting stations in many markets also compete with commercial stations for viewers. In addition, the Internet and other leisure activities may draw viewers away from commercial television stations. 
 Advertising Sales 
 General 
 Television station revenue is primarily derived from the sale of local and national advertising. All network-affiliated stations are required to carry advertising sold by their networks which reduces the amount of advertising time available for sale by stations. Our stations sell the remaining advertising to be inserted in network programming and the advertising in non-network programming, retaining all of the revenue received from these sales. A national syndicated program distributor will often retain a portion of the available advertising time for programming it supplies in exchange for no fees or reduced fees charged to stations for such programming. These programming arrangements are referred to as barter programming. 
 Advertisers wishing to reach a national audience usually purchase time directly from the networks or advertise nationwide on a case-by-case basis. National advertisers who wish to reach a particular region or local audience often buy advertising time directly from local stations through national advertising sales representative firms. Local businesses purchase advertising time directly from the station’s local sales staff. 
 Advertising rates are based upon a number of factors, including: 
  
• | a program’s popularity among the viewers that an advertiser wishes to target;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the number of advertisers competing for the available time;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | the size and the demographic composition of the market served by the station;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the availability of alternative advertising media in the market;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | the effectiveness of the station’s sales force;
--+------------------------------------------------


• | development of projects, features and programs that tie advertiser messages to programming; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the level of spending commitment made by the advertiser.
--+---------------------------------------------------------

 Advertising rates are also determined by a station’s overall ability to attract viewers in its market area, as well as the station’s ability to attract viewers among particular demographic groups that an advertiser may be targeting. Advertising revenue is positively affected by strong local economies. Conversely, declines in advertising budgets of advertisers, particularly in recessionary periods, adversely affect the broadcast industry and, as a result, may contribute to a decrease in the revenue of broadcast television stations. 
 12

Seasonality 
 Advertising revenue is positively affected by national and regional political election campaigns, and certain events such as the Olympic Games or the Super Bowl. Stations’ advertising revenue is generally highest in the second and fourth quarters of each year, due in part to increases in consumer advertising in the spring and retail advertising in the period leading up to, and including, the holiday season. In addition, advertising revenue is generally higher during even-numbered years when state, congressional and presidential elections occur and advertising is aired during the Olympic Games. 
Local Sales 
 Local advertising time is sold by each station’s local sales staff who call upon advertising agencies and local businesses, which typically include car dealerships, retail stores and restaurants. Compared to revenue from national advertising accounts, revenue from local advertising is generally more stable and more predictable. We seek to attract new advertisers to our television stations and websites and to increase the amount of advertising time sold to existing local advertisers by relying on experienced local sales forces with strong community ties, producing news and other programming with local advertising appeal and sponsoring or co-promoting local events and activities. We place a strong emphasis on the experience of our local sales staff and maintain an on-going training program for sales personnel. 
National Sales 
 National advertising time is sold through national sales representative firms which call upon advertising agencies, whose clients typically include automobile manufacturers and dealer groups, telecommunications companies, fast food franchisers, and national retailers (some of which may advertise locally). 
Compensation for Retransmission Consent
 We receive compensation from cable, satellite and other MVPDs in our markets in return for our consent to the retransmission of the signals of our television stations. The revenues primarily represent payments from the MVPDs and are typically based on the number of subscribers they have. Our successful negotiations with MVPDs have created agreements that now produce meaningful sustainable revenue streams.
Network Affiliations 
 All of the full power television stations that we own and operate, program or provide sales and other services to as of December 31, 2016 are affiliated with a network pursuant to an affiliation agreement. The agreements with ABC, FOX, NBC, and CBS are the most significant to our operations. The terms of these agreements expire as discussed below:

Network Affiliations | Expiration Date 
ABC | Of the 20 agreements, two expired in December 2016 and have been extended pending renewal negotiations, 17 expire in December 2017 and one expires in June 2019. 
FOX | Of the 26 agreements, 25 expired in December 2016 and have been extended pending renewal negotiations, and one expires in December 2017. 
NBC | Of the 19 agreements, one expires in December 2018 and 18 expire in December 2019. 
CBS | Of the 23 agreements, one expires in January 2018, two expire in June 2018, three expire in September 2018, nine expire in December 2018 and eight expire in June 2020.

 
Each affiliation agreement provides the affiliated station with the right to broadcast all programs transmitted by the network with which it is affiliated. In exchange, the network receives affiliation fees and has the right to sell a substantial majority of the advertising time during these broadcasts. We expect the network affiliation agreements listed above to be renewed upon expiration.
 
Prior to the Merger, Media General owned, operated, or serviced 79 full power television stations in 48 markets. Of the 79 full power television stations, 26 are affiliated with CBS, 17 with NBC, 13 with ABC and eight with FOX. Substantially concurrent with the Merger, we sold the assets of 12 full power television stations in 12 markets. Of the 12 stations divested, four are affiliated with CBS, three with FOX, two with ABC and two with NBC. Following these transactions, we own, operate, program or provide sales and other services to 171 full power television stations in 100 markets, reaching approximately 44.7 million viewers or nearly 39% of all U.S. television households. For additional information with respect to the Merger, refer to Item 1, “Business—Merger with Media General” and Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15(a) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Competition 
 Competition in the television industry takes place on several levels: competition for audience, competition for programming and competition for advertising.
 Audience. We compete for audience share specifically on the basis of program popularity. The popularity of a station’s programming has a direct effect on the advertising rates it can charge its advertisers. A portion of the daily programming on the stations that we own or provide services to is supplied by the network with which each station is affiliated. In those periods, the stations are dependent upon the performance of the network programs in attracting viewers. Stations program non-network time periods with a combination of self-produced news, public affairs and other entertainment programming, including movies and syndicated programs. The major television networks have also begun to provide their programming directly to the consumer via portable digital devices such as tablets and cell phones, which presents an additional source of competition for television broadcaster audience share. Other sources of competition for audience include home entertainment systems (such as VCRs, DVDs and DVRs), video-on-demand and pay-per-view, the Internet (including network distribution of programming through websites and mobile platforms) and gaming devices.
 Although the commercial television broadcast industry historically has been dominated by the ABC, NBC, CBS and FOX television networks, other newer television networks and the growth in popularity of subscription systems, such as local cable and direct broadcast satellite (“DBS”) systems and video streaming services which air exclusive programming not otherwise available in a market, have become significant competitors for the over-the-air television audience.
 Programming. Competition for programming involves negotiating with national program distributors or syndicators that sell first-run and rerun packages of programming. Stations compete against in-market broadcast station operators for exclusive access to off-network reruns (such as Two and a Half Men) and first-run product (such as Entertainment Tonight) in their respective markets. Cable systems generally do not compete with local stations for programming, although various national cable networks from time to time have acquired programs that would have otherwise been offered to local television stations. Time Warner, Inc., Comcast Corporation, Viacom Inc., CBS Corporation, The News Corporation Limited and the Walt Disney Company each owns a television network and multiple cable networks and also owns or controls major production studios, which are the primary sources of programming for the networks. It is uncertain whether in the future such programming, which is generally subject to short-term agreements between the studios and the networks, will be moved from or to the networks. Television broadcasters also compete for non-network programming unique to the markets they serve. As such, stations strive to provide exclusive news stories and unique features such as investigative reporting and coverage of community events and to secure broadcast rights for regional and local sporting events. 
 Advertising. Stations compete for advertising revenue with other television stations in their respective markets and other advertising media such as newspapers, radio stations, magazines, outdoor advertising, transit advertising, yellow page directories, direct mail, MVPDs and the Internet. Competition for advertising dollars in the broadcasting industry occurs primarily within individual markets. Generally, a television broadcast station in a particular market does not compete with stations in other market areas. 
 
The broadcasting industry is continually faced with technological change and innovation which increase the popularity of competing entertainment and communications media. Further advances in technology may increase competition for household audiences and advertisers. The increased use of digital technology by MVPDs, along with video compression techniques, will reduce the bandwidth required for television signal transmission. These technological developments are applicable to all video delivery systems, including over-the-air broadcasting, and have the potential to provide vastly expanded programming to highly targeted audiences. Reductions in the cost of creating additional channel capacity could lower entry barriers for new channels and encourage the development of increasingly specialized “niche” programming. This ability to reach very narrowly defined audiences is expected to alter the competitive dynamics for advertising expenditures. We are unable to predict the effect that these or other technological changes will have on the broadcast television industry or on the future results of our operations or the operations of the stations to which we provide services.

Federal Regulation 
 Television broadcasting is subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the “Communications Act”). The following is a brief discussion of certain (but not all) provisions of the Communications Act and the FCC’s regulations and policies that affect the business operations of television broadcast stations. Over the years, the U.S. Congress and the FCC have added, amended and deleted statutory and regulatory requirements to which station owners are subject. Some of these changes have a minimal business impact whereas others may significantly affect the business or operation of individual stations or the broadcast industry as a whole. For more information about the nature and extent of FCC regulation of television broadcast stations, you should refer to the Communications Act and the FCC’s rules, case precedent, public notices and policies. 
 License Grant and Renewal. The Communications Act prohibits the operation of broadcast stations except under licenses issued by the FCC. Television broadcast licenses are granted for a maximum term of eight years and are subject to renewal upon application to the FCC. The FCC is required to grant an application for license renewal if during the preceding term the station served the public interest, the licensee did not commit any serious violations of the Communications Act or the FCC’s rules, and the licensee committed no other violations of the Communications Act or the FCC’s rules which, taken together, would constitute a pattern of abuse. A majority of renewal applications are routinely granted under this standard. If a licensee fails to meet this standard the FCC may still grant renewal on terms and conditions that it deems appropriate, including a monetary forfeiture or renewal for a term less than the normal eight-year period.
 After a renewal application is filed, interested parties, including members of the public, may file petitions to deny the application, to which the licensee/renewal applicant is entitled to respond. After reviewing the pleadings, if the FCC determines that there is a substantial and material question of fact whether grant of the renewal application would serve the public interest, the FCC is required to hold a hearing on the issues presented. If, after the hearing, the FCC determines that the renewal applicant has met the renewal standard, the FCC will grant the renewal application. If the licensee/renewal applicant fails to meet the renewal standard or show that there are mitigating factors entitling it to renewal subject to appropriate sanctions, the FCC can deny the renewal application. In the vast majority of cases where a petition to deny is filed against a renewal application, the FCC ultimately grants the renewal without a hearing. No competing application for authority to operate a station and replace the incumbent licensee may be filed against a renewal application. 
 In addition to considering rule violations in connection with a license renewal application, the FCC may sanction a station licensee for failing to observe FCC rules and policies during the license term, including the imposition of a monetary forfeiture. 
 Under the Communications Act, the term of a broadcast license is automatically extended during the pendency of the FCC’s processing of a timely renewal application. 
 Station Transfer. The Communications Act prohibits the assignment or the transfer of control of a broadcast license without prior FCC approval. 
 Ownership Restrictions. The Communications Act limits the extent of non-U.S. ownership of companies that own U.S. broadcast stations. Under this restriction, the holder of a U.S. broadcast license may have no more than 20% non-U.S. ownership (by vote and by equity). The Communications Act further prohibits more than 25% indirect foreign ownership or control of a licensee through a parent company unless the FCC determines the public interest will be served by waiver of such restriction. The FCC has interpreted this provision of the Communications Act to require an affirmative public interest finding before indirect foreign ownership of a broadcast licensee may exceed 25%, and historically the FCC has made such an affirmative finding only in limited circumstances. In November 2013, the FCC clarified that it would entertain and authorize, on a case-by-case basis and upon a sufficient public interest showing, proposals to exceed the 25% indirect foreign ownership limit in broadcast licensees. In September 2016, the FCC adopted rules to simplify and streamline the process for requesting authority to exceed the 25% indirect foreign ownership limit and reformed the methodology that publicly traded broadcasters may use to assess their compliance with the foreign ownership restrictions. 

15

The FCC also has rules which establish limits on the ownership of broadcast stations. These ownership limits apply to attributable interests in a station licensee held by an individual, corporation, partnership or other entity. In the case of corporations, officers, directors and voting stock interests of 5% or more (20% or more in the case of certain passive investors, such as insurance companies and bank trust departments) are considered attributable interests. For partnerships, all general partners and non-insulated limited partners are attributable. Limited liability companies are treated the same as partnerships. The FCC also considers attributable the holder of more than 33% of a licensee’s total assets (defined as total debt plus total equity), if that person or entity also provides over 15% of the station’s total weekly broadcast programming or has an attributable interest in another media entity in the same market which is subject to the FCC’s ownership rules, such as a radio or television station or daily newspaper. If a shareholder of Nexstar holds a voting stock interest of 5% or more (20% or more in the case of certain passive investors, such as insurance companies and bank trust departments), we must report that shareholder, its parent entities, and attributable individuals and entities of both, as attributable interest holders in Nexstar. 
 Two of Nexstar’s directors currently serve on the board of directors of Radio One, Inc., which owns and operates approximately 55 radio stations in 16 markets. The FCC considers the radio stations owned by Radio One, Inc. as attributable to Nexstar due to this common director relationship.
 Local Television Ownership (Duopoly Rule). Under the current local television ownership, or “duopoly,” rule, a single entity is allowed to own or have attributable interests in two television stations in a market if (1) the two stations do not have overlapping service areas, or (2) after the combination there are at least eight independently owned and operating full-power television stations in the DMA with overlapping service contours and one of the combining stations is not ranked among the top four stations in the DMA. The duopoly rule allows the FCC to consider waivers to permit the ownership of a second station only in cases where the second station has failed or is failing or unbuilt. The FCC reconfirmed that the Duopoly Rule continues to serve the public interest in its 2016 quadrennial review decision.  We have sought reconsideration of this decision.
 Under the duopoly rule, the FCC attributes toward the local television ownership limits another in-market station when one station owner programs that station pursuant to a time brokerage or local marketing agreement, if the programmer provides more than 15% of the second station’s weekly broadcast programming. However, local marketing agreements entered into prior to November 5, 1996 are exempt attributable interests until the FCC determines otherwise. This “grandfathering,” when reviewed by the FCC, is subject to possible extension or termination. 
 In August 2016 the FCC completed its most recent quadrennial media ownership review and adopted a rule that attributes another in-market station toward the local television ownership limits when one station owner sells more than 15% of the second station’s weekly advertising inventory under a JSA (this rule had been previously adopted, but was vacated by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit).  Parties to JSAs entered into prior to March 31, 2014 may continue to operate under these JSAs until September 30, 2025.  We have sought FCC reconsideration of the JSA attribution rule.
 In certain markets, the Company owns and operates both full-power and low-power television broadcast stations. The FCC’s duopoly rules and policies regarding ownership of television stations in the same market apply only to full-power television stations and not low-power television stations. 
 In a number of markets, the Company owns two stations in compliance with the duopoly rule. We also are permitted to own two or more stations in various other markets pursuant to waivers under the FCC’s rules permitting common ownership of a “satellite” television station in a market where a licensee also owns the “primary” station.  Additionally, we are permitted to own two stations in the Quad Cities, Illinois/Iowa, Greenville-Spartanburg, South Carolina-Asheville, North Carolina and Hartford-New Haven, Connecticut markets pursuant to waivers allowing ownership of a second station where that station is “failing.” 
 In all of the markets where we have entered into local service agreements, except for five, we provide programming comprising less than 15% of the second station’s programming. In the five markets where we provide more programming to the second station—WFXP in Erie, Pennsylvania, KHMT in Billings, Montana, KFQX in Grand Junction, Colorado, KNVA in Austin, Texas and WNAC-TV in Providence, Rhode Island—the local marketing agreements were entered into prior to November 5, 1996 and are considered grandfathered. Therefore, we may continue to program these stations under the terms of these agreements until the FCC determines otherwise.
 With respect to our other local service agreements, the FCC’s JSA attribution rule makes a majority of our JSAs attributable, but we are allowed to maintain those agreements in effect through September 30, 2025.  Our shared services agreements with independently owned same-market stations remain permissible, but the FCC may in the future consider regulations with respect to such agreements.

National Television Ownership. There is no limit on the number of television stations which a party may own. However, the FCC’s rules limit the percentage of U.S. television households which a party may reach through its attributable interests in television stations to 39%. This rule formerly provided that when calculating a party’s nationwide aggregate audience coverage, the ownership of an ultra-high frequency (“UHF”) station would be counted as 50% of a market’s percentage of total national audience.  In August 2016, the FCC adopted an order eliminating this “UHF discount.”  Certain parties have filed for reconsideration of this decision, while others have sought court review. 
 The stations that Nexstar owns have a combined national audience reach of 38.9% of television households without the UHF discount. 
 Radio/Television Cross-Ownership Rule (One-to-a-Market Rule). In markets with at least 20 independently owned media “voices,” ownership of one television station and up to seven radio stations, or two television stations (if allowed under the television duopoly rule) and six radio stations is permitted. If the number of independently owned media “voices” is fewer than 20 but greater than or equal to 10, ownership of one television station (or two if allowed) and four radio stations is permitted. In markets with fewer than 10 independent media “voices,” ownership of one television station (or two if allowed) and one radio station is permitted. In calculating the number of independent media “voices” in a market, the FCC includes all independently owned radio and television stations, independently owned cable systems (counted as one voice), and independently owned daily newspapers which have circulation that exceeds 5% of the households in the market. In all cases, the television and radio components of the combination must also comply, respectively, with the local television ownership rule and the local radio ownership rule. 
 Because two of Nexstar’s directors also currently serve on the board of directors of Radio One, Inc., which owns and operates approximately 55 radio stations in 16 markets, the FCC considers the radio stations owned by Radio One, Inc. as attributable to Nexstar.  Therefore, depending on the number of radio stations owned by Radio One, Inc. in a given market, we may not be able to purchase a television station in that market. 
 Local Television/Newspaper Cross-Ownership Rule. Under this rule, a party is prohibited from having an attributable interest in a television station and a daily newspaper in the same market. 
 
The FCC is required to review its media ownership rules every four years to eliminate those rules it finds no longer serve the “public interest, convenience and necessity.” In August 2016, the FCC adopted a Second Report and Order (the “2016 Ownership Order”) concluding the agency’s 2010 and 2014 quadrennial reviews.  The 2016 Ownership Order (1) retains the existing local television ownership rule and radio/television cross-ownership rule (with minor technical modifications to address the transition to digital television broadcasting), (2) extends the current ban on common ownership of two top-four television stations in a market to network affiliation swaps, (3) retains the existing ban on newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership in local markets while considering waivers and providing an exception for failed or failing entities, (4) retains the existing dual network rule, (5) makes JSA relationships attributable interests and (6) defines a category of sharing agreements designated as SSAs between stations and requires public disclosure of those SSAs (while not considering them attributable).  The FCC’s 2016 Ownership Order is subject to pending petitions for reconsideration and court appeals.  We have sought FCC reconsideration of the order. 
 
Local Television/Cable Cross-Ownership. There is no FCC rule prohibiting common ownership of a cable television system and a television broadcast station in the same area. 
 
MVPD Carriage of Local Television Signals. Broadcasters may obtain carriage of their stations’ signals on cable, satellite and other MVPDs through either mandatory carriage or through “retransmission consent.” Every three years all stations must formally elect either mandatory carriage (“must-carry” for cable distributors and “carry one-carry all” for satellite television providers) or retransmission consent. The next election must be made by October 1, 2017, and will be effective January 1, 2018. Must-carry elections require that the MVPD carry one station programming stream and related data in the station’s local market. However, MVPDs may decline a must-carry election in certain circumstances. MVPDs do not pay a fee to stations that elect mandatory carriage.
 
A broadcaster that elects retransmission consent waives its mandatory carriage rights, and the broadcaster and the MVPD must negotiate in good faith for carriage of the station’s signal. Negotiated terms may include channel position, service tier carriage, carriage of multiple program streams, compensation and other consideration. If a broadcaster elects to negotiate retransmission terms, it is possible that the broadcaster and the MVPD will not reach agreement and that the MVPD will not carry the station’s signal.

MVPD operators are actively seeking to change the regulations under which retransmission consent is negotiated before both the U.S. Congress and the FCC in order to increase their bargaining leverage with television stations. On March 3, 2011, the FCC initiated a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to reexamine its rules (i) governing the requirements for good faith negotiations between MVPDs and broadcasters, including implementing a prohibition on one station negotiating retransmission consent terms for another station under a local service agreement; (ii) for providing advance notice to consumers in the event of dispute; and (iii) to extend certain cable-only obligations to all MVPDs. The FCC also asked for comment on eliminating the network non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity protection rules, which may permit MVPDs to import out-of-market television stations in certain circumstances.
 
In March 2014, the FCC amended its rules governing “good faith” retransmission consent negotiations to provide that it is a per se violation of the statutory duty to negotiate in good faith for a television broadcast station that is ranked among the top-four stations in a market (as measured by audience share) to negotiate retransmission consent jointly with another top-four station in the same market if the stations are not commonly owned.  Under this rule, top-four stations may not (1) delegate authority to negotiate or approve a retransmission consent agreement to another non-commonly owned top-four station located in the same DMA or to a third party that negotiates on behalf of another non-commonly owned top-four station in the same DMA; or (2) facilitate or agree to facilitate coordinated negotiation of retransmission consent terms between themselves, including through the sharing of information.  This rule took effect on June 18, 2014. On December 5, 2014, the U.S. Congress extended the joint negotiation prohibition to all non-commonly owned television stations in a market. Retransmission consent agreements jointly negotiated prior to June 18, 2014 remain enforceable until the end of their current terms; however, contractual provisions between separately owned same-market stations to consult or jointly negotiate retransmission consent agreements are void.  Accordingly, the VIEs with which we have sharing agreements must separately negotiate their respective retransmission consent agreements with MVPDs.  Concurrently with its adoption of the prohibition on certain joint retransmission consent negotiations, the FCC also adopted a further notice of proposed rulemaking which seeks additional comment on the elimination or modification of the network non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity rules.  Comments and reply comments on the further notice were filed in 2014.
 
In addition, in the STELA Reauthorization Act of 2014, which was adopted and signed into law in December 2014, the U.S. Congress directed the FCC to commence a rulemaking to “review its totality of the circumstances test for good faith [retransmission consent] negotiations.”  The FCC commenced this proceeding in September 2015, and comments and reply comments were filed in 2015 and 2016.  In July 2016, the then-Chairman of the FCC publicly announced that the agency would not adopt additional rules in this proceeding; however, the proceeding remains open.
 
The FCC’s rules also govern which local television signals a satellite subscriber may receive. The U.S. Congress and the FCC have also imposed certain requirements relating to satellite distribution of local television signals to “unserved” households that do not receive a useable signal from a local network-affiliated station and to cable and satellite carriage of out-of-market signals. 
 
In June 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court held that an over-the-top video distributors’ (“OTTDs”) retransmissions of broadcast television signals without the consent of the broadcast station violate copyright holders’ exclusive right to perform their works publicly as provided under the Copyright Act.  In December 2014, the FCC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposing to interpret the term “MVPD” to encompass OTTDs that make available for purchase multiple streams of video programming distributed at a prescheduled time, and seeking comment on the effects of applying MVPD rules to such OTTDs.  Comments and reply comments were filed in 2015. Although the FCC has not classified OTTDs and MVPDs to-date, several OTTDs are actively seeking to negotiate agreements for retransmission of local stations within their markets.
 
The Company has elected to exercise retransmission consent rights for all of its stations where it has legal rights to do so. The Company has negotiated retransmission consent agreements with the majority of MVPDs serving its markets to carry the stations’ signals and, where permitted by its network affiliation agreements will negotiate agreements with OTTDs.
