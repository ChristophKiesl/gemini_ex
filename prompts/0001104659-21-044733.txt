ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
Except as expressly stated or the context otherwise requires, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” “the Company” and “GNOG” refer to Golden Nugget Online Gaming, Inc.
 
We are an online gaming, or iGaming, and digital sports entertainment company focused on providing our customers with the most enjoyable, realistic and exciting online gaming experience in the market. We currently operate in New Jersey and Michigan where we offer patrons the ability to play their favorite casino games and bet on live-action sports events. Our desire to innovate, improve and offer the most realistic online gaming platform drives our employees and defines our business, as we pursue our vision to be the leading destination for online gaming players with a modern mindset. We maintain an expansive catalogue of online casino games in the New Jersey market with over 800 titles.
 
We are authorized by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement (“DGE”) and the Michigan Gaming Control Board (“MGCB”) to operate interactive real money online gaming in New Jersey and Michigan. We were one of the first online gaming operators to enter the New Jersey market in 2013 and one of the first to enter the Michigan market in January of 2021. As an affiliate of the Golden Nugget/Landry’s (“GNL”) family of companies, we aspire to live up to the reputation of Golden Nugget, a storied brand in the gaming industry, by providing customers with an online gaming experience consistent with Golden Nugget’s land-based casinos. Our technology is designed to create superior online betting experiences for the avid casino and sports bettor. Our goals have been shaped with these players in mind, both in who he or she is today and who we anticipate he or she will become as the gaming industry evolves. The Golden Nugget vision underpins our position as a market leader and innovator in today’s rapidly expanding online gaming industry.
 
We believe we are well-positioned for continued growth with the support of the Golden Nugget brand and its seasoned management team, together with its commitment to innovation. We believe that this enviable combination of expertise, brand recognition and infrastructure will not only support our continued success in the New Jersey market, but also allow the company to capture market share in other key iGaming states in the future. We recently entered the Michigan market, and are currently targeting Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Virginia and Illinois as states in which we plan to enter in the near future, subject to regulatory approvals, while continuing to evaluate entry into additional markets.
 
We have experienced tremendous growth since we began operations. According to information published by the DGE, as of December 31, 2020, our market share in the New Jersey online gaming market was 11%. Our gross gaming revenues, or GGR (as defined below), have grown from $9.6 million in 2014 to $60.9 million in 2019, and $101.9 million in 2020. In addition, we have steadily grown our average monthly net casino revenue per depositing user (“Net Casino ARPU”) from $467 in 2014 to $566 in 2019, and $631 in 2020. Our GGR is defined as the sum of all customer wagers (including the amount of all promotional credits wagered by such customers), minus all winnings paid to such customers on such wagers. For purposes of calculating our GGR, we include only settled wagers, and exclude all pending online casino or online sports bets which have not yet settled (e.g., sports bets on sports events that have not concluded as of the date of determination of GGR).
 
Corporate History
 
Golden Nugget Online Gaming, Inc. (formerly known as Landcadia Holdings II, Inc. or “Landcadia”) was originally incorporated as CAPS Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company on August 11, 2015 and converted into a Delaware corporation on February 4, 2019 for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, recapitalization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses. On May 9, 2019, Landcadia consummated an initial public offering, after which its securities began trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market LLC.
 
On December 29, 2020 we completed the acquisition of Golden Nugget Online Gaming, LLC (formerly known as Golden Nugget Online Gaming, Inc.) (“GNOG LLC”),, a New Jersey limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of GNOG Holdco (as defined below). The acquisition was completed pursuant to the purchase agreement, dated June 28, 2020 (as amended on September 17, 2020 and December 20, 2020) by and among the Company, LHGN HoldCo, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and newly formed, wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“Landcadia Holdco”), Landry’s Fertitta, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (“LF LLC”), GNOG Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and newly formed, wholly-owned subsidiary of LF LLC (“GNOG Holdco”), and GNOG LLC. Following the closing of the acquisition, we changed our name from “Landcadia Holdings II, Inc.” to “Golden Nugget Online Gaming, Inc.”

GNOG LLC was incorporated in New Jersey in February 2011 under the name Landry’s A/C Gaming, Inc., which was subsequently changed to Landry’s Finance Acquisition Co. in November 2011 and ultimately Golden Nugget Online Gaming, Inc. on May 6, 2020. In December 2020 and in connection with the transaction, GNOG Inc. converted into a limited liability company by merging with and into GNOG LLC.
 
We operate as an umbrella partnership C-corporation, or “Up-C,” meaning that substantially all of our assets are held indirectly through GNOG LLC, our indirect subsidiary, and our business is conducted through GNOG LLC.
 
Industry Background/Market Opportunity
 
We are focused on becoming a leader in U.S. online gaming, which is a fast-growing part of the larger U.S. gaming industry. iGaming includes all online casino games played on a computer or mobile device such as slots, video poker, electronic table games and live dealer table games, but does not include online sports wagering. The iGaming market includes both “Pure Casino” players who sign up for the primary purpose of playing online casino games, such as slots or table games, as well as sports betting players who also want to play casino games. According to the DGE, the iGaming market in New Jersey has grown significantly, from approximately $221 million in total iGaming revenues in 2017 to approximately $462 million in 2019.
 
The current COVID-19 pandemic has served as a catalyst to accelerate growth in the U.S. iGaming industry as many people are spending more time at home. The pandemic has changed the way people work and live, with an increased use and dependence on technology and a need for at-home entertainment options. The number of people engaging in iGaming has increased significantly as a result of these changes, some of which are currently expected to continue for an indefinite period of time or may become permanent. Total iGaming revenues in New Jersey for 2020 were $931.5 million, representing a 101.7% increase over the same period in 2019, according to the DGE.
 
We operate real money online gaming within the State of New Jersey, and since January 2021, in the State of Michigan. We are also contracted to manage certain third parties that are also authorized to operate real money online gaming in New Jersey, for which we receive royalties and cost reimbursement. Today, iGaming is legal in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Michigan, and West Virginia, and online sports betting is legal in fourteen states and the District of Columbia. In addition, legislation to legalize iGaming and/or sports betting is pending in several states. We anticipate that legalization of iGaming and online sports betting will expand across the U.S. as states understand and appreciate the revenue potential.
 
Over the last few years, iGaming revenue as a percentage of land-based gaming revenue has grown. Based on data released by the DGE, between 2016 and 2019, iGaming revenue grew from 7% to 17% of land-based gaming revenue in New Jersey. For 2020, iGaming revenue in New Jersey represented 62% of land-based gaming revenue, according to data published by the DGE. On March 16, 2020, all Atlantic City land-based casinos were required to close because of the governmental response to the COVD-19 pandemic. In January, February and March 2020, online gaming revenues represented 27.7%, 23.0% and 75.8% of Atlantic City land-based casino gaming revenues, respectively. During April, May and June 2020, Atlantic City land-based casino gaming revenues was $0. Atlantic City casinos reopened on July 2, 2020, resulting in the percentage of online gaming revenues compared to Atlantic City land-based casino gaming revenues decreasing to 65.6% for the month of December 2020. The increase in online gaming revenues in 2020 is attributable, in part, to the temporary closure of Atlantic City casinos, leading traditional casino players to utilize online gaming. Nonetheless, we believe the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the growth trend in online gaming. Our management estimates that, on a run-rate basis, the iGaming market in the U.S. over time will achieve 30% penetration versus the land-based market. Based on nationwide land-based commercial and tribal gaming revenues of $75 billion in 2018, 30% penetration implies a $22 billion revenue potential in the long-term U.S. iGaming market.

Strength of the Golden Nugget Brand
 
One of the unique features that has contributed to our success is our affiliation with GNL and Tilman Fertitta, GNL’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. GNL is a household name in the U.S., with a diversified restaurant, hospitality, entertainment and gaming portfolio that includes:

• | 600 outlets;
--+-------------


• | three hotels;
--+--------------


• | four aquariums;
--+----------------


• | two amusement parks; and
--+-------------------------


• | five Golden Nugget casinos.
--+----------------------------

 
The Golden Nugget name is a well-known and storied brand in the gaming industry. Celebrated since opening as a gambling hall in Las Vegas in 1946, Golden Nugget today is associated with gaming and high-quality service at an attractive value. Golden Nugget maintains a geographically diverse portfolio of five land-based casinos: Golden Nugget Las Vegas, Nevada; Golden Nugget Laughlin, Nevada; Golden Nugget Lake Charles, Louisiana; Golden Nugget Biloxi, Mississippi; and Golden Nugget Atlantic City, New Jersey. The Golden Nugget casino properties offer popular slot machines and table games as well as a wide selection of amenities.
 
As the online gaming affiliate of Golden Nugget Atlantic City, we have taken the best aspects of its legacy brand and modified them to attract today’s online gaming customer.
 
Tilman Fertitta is an internationally recognized businessman with a significant media presence throughout the U.S. According to CNBC, Mr. Fertitta’s TV show, “Billion Dollar Buyer,” was the network’s “most watched premiere hour ever” in 2016 and has aired three successful seasons. In addition, he is a New York Times Best-Selling author with his book “Shut Up and Listen,” which outlines his business philosophies. In addition to GNL, Mr. Fertitta is the sole owner of the NBA’s Houston Rockets. Our brand has been significantly enhanced through Mr. Fertitta’s promotion and support of our company.
 
iGaming Focus Targeting High Value Customers
 
As one of the only true iGaming-focused online gaming companies, we believe we are well positioned to continue to acquire the highest value customers in the iGaming market. While we offer both iGaming and online sports betting, our management believes the combination of higher lifetime player value (“LTV”) and player demographics of iGaming players creates a superior value proposition for iGaming. As a result, we intend to focus our efforts on acquiring high value iGaming players. Nevertheless, we believe offering online sports betting increases our competitive advantage because many online sports betting players also choose to play casino games.
 
3

 

A key to our success is our superior ability to acquire and retain the highest value iGaming players, resulting in higher engagement as measured by LTV. We believe that the average iGaming player plays longer, reinvests his or her winnings more quickly and has a higher disposable income, all of which contributes to a higher total engagement per active month than land-based casino players and online sports bettors. As of December 31, 2020, our five-year gross LTV in gross gaming revenue was approximately $7,671, which we believe is greater than that of our competitors. In addition, we have steadily grown our Net Casino ARPU from $467 in 2014 to $566 in 2019, and $631 in 2020.
 
Player demographics for our iGaming players are relatively split between gender, with around 55% of customers being male and 45% being female. In contrast, approximately 95% of our online sports bettors are male. Similarly, our average iGaming player is between 40 and 45 years old, whereas our online sports player tends to be between 30 and 35 years old.
 
Profitable Customer Acquisition
 
Another component of our success is our ability to attract new high value customers through GNL’s customer database. Landry’s Select Club, a restaurant loyalty program implemented in 2009 by GNL, had over 3 million members as of December 31, 2020, and prior to the outbreak of COVID-19, was adding more than 5,500 members per week. Approximately 18% of GNL’s restaurant sales are associated with Landry’s Select Club transactions. The Golden Nugget 24k Select Club, a loyalty program for Golden Nugget casino customers, had over 3.9 million members as of December 31, 2020, and prior to the outbreak of COVID-19, was adding over 7,000 new members per week on average since July of 2019. In 2019, approximately 80% of rated play revenue at Golden Nugget casinos was associated with 24k members. Management believes that access to this database is an advantage in promoting our products to new customers and will accelerate our growth into new jurisdictions as the legalization of online gaming spreads across the U.S.
 
In addition to using the GNL databases, we target our marketing efforts through high-quality traffic sources including TV advertising, targeted digital spend, and extensive relationships with leading affiliates in the U.S. market to increase our customer base. As is typical in high-growth industries, we believe most companies in the online gaming vertical to date have allocated a disproportionate amount of their capital to marketing and advertising to build a customer database in the hopes of capturing market share. In contrast, we have been able to keep customer acquisition costs relatively low as a percentage of our revenue while achieving significant growth. We estimate that new players typically reach a break-even return on investment, or ROI, by month five, earn the company an approximately 2.2x ROI by year one, and an approximately 8.0x ROI by year five, in each case where ROI is calculated as cumulative GGR divided by advertising spend.
 
Market-Leading Innovation and Content
 
We offer customers a superior platform for iGaming with what we believe to be a best-in-class iGaming content mix, combined with continued innovation and new product offerings. As of December 31, 2020, we offered over 800 game titles in New Jersey, which we believe gives us a significant lead in the New Jersey market in terms of total available content. We believe that our ability to offer a wider array of iGaming products effectively reduces our customer acquisition costs and player churn by providing a superior product offering as compared to our competitors.
 
We believe that our commitment to innovation is demonstrated by consistently being first-to-market with the latest iGaming offerings:
 

• | Live Dealer Studio. We were the first company to launch a Live Dealer studio in the United States. The Live Dealer studio provides a more realistic environment for customers through interactions with a live dealer and fellow players, which our management believes has been a significant factor in convincing casino players to use iGaming. Because of the success of the Live Dealer studio, we have 18 tables in our Live Dealer studio as of December 31, 2020, increased from four tables when we first offered this product in 2016.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Golden Nugget Branded Video Slot Games. We believe that we were also the first to offer a branded video slot game online, the “Golden Nugget Video Slot,” which gives players the experience of being in one of Golden Nugget’s land-based casinos. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | New Games. We have been successful in introducing new game categories to its customers, such as Steppers and Megaways.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We are well positioned to maintain our status as an online gaming innovator through our strategic partnerships with the top gaming equipment suppliers in the industry, including Scientific Games Digital (“SGD”). We have a multi-year, multi-state, multi-product, multi-channel agreement with SGD for iGaming and sports betting, whereby SGD provides us with its core platform (Player Account Management, Wallet, Bonusing Tools), online casino platform (Open Gaming System), and online games, and has agreed to provide us with its online sports betting platform and sports managed trading services through June 30, 2024 in New Jersey, and will provide such platforms and services in the future for terms of generally three or four years following specified milestone events such as the initial deployment of our software in a state or of any additional vertical in Nevada, Mississippi and Pennsylvania. This and other partnerships have enabled us to launch 20 exclusive games in 2020, with 80 more games that are expected to be released from the date hereof through the end of 2021.
 
Continued Support from GNL
 
We receive significant support from GNL through several contractual arrangements described below. We believe our relationship with GNL is highly constructive and will enable us to be successful in the long-term. Set forth below is a summary of the terms of these contractual arrangements.
 
Trademark License Agreement. Pursuant to this agreement, GNLV has granted to GNOG LLC an exclusive license to use certain “Golden Nugget” trademarks (and other trademarks related to GNOG LLC’s business) in connection with operating online real money casino gambling and sports wagering in the U.S. and any of its territories, subject to certain restrictions. The license has a twenty-year term that commenced on December 29, 2020, the date that we completed the acquisition of GNOG LLC (the “Closing Date”). During the term of the agreement, GNOG LLC has agreed to pay Golden Nugget a monthly royalty payment equal to 3% of net gaming revenue (as such term is defined in such agreement). Upon the tenth and fifteenth anniversary of the effective date of the Trademark License Agreement, the monthly royalty amount payable to GNLV will be adjusted to equal the greater of (i) 3% of net gaming revenue and (ii) the fair market value of the licenses (as determined by an independent appraiser, if necessary).
 
While the trademarks licensed under the Trademark License Agreement generally will be exclusively licensed to GNOG LLC, in the event that (i) a new market or opportunity becomes available (e.g., pursuant to the legalization of online gaming in another jurisdiction), and (ii) GNOG LLC is unwilling, unable or otherwise fails to pursue such market or opportunity, Golden Nugget will be permitted to pursue such market or opportunity and utilize the trademarks covered by the Trademark License Agreement with respect thereto. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in the Trademark License Agreement will restrict GNOG LLC (or Golden Nugget) from owning or operating an online-based casino using marks that are not covered by the Trademark License Agreement.
 
A&R Online Gaming Operations Agreement with GNAC. Pursuant to this agreement, GNAC granted GNOG LLC the right to host, manage, control, operate, support and administer, under GNAC’s land-based casino operating licenses, the Golden Nugget-branded online gaming business, live dealer studio in New Jersey and the third-party operators. Under the agreement, GNOG LLC is responsible for managing, administering and operating its online gaming business and providing services to GNAC in connection with the management and administration of certain platform agreements and GNAC is required to provide certain operational and infrastructure services to GNOG LLC in connection with its New Jersey operations. In addition to the 3% royalty payable pursuant to the Trademark License Agreement as described above, GNOG LLC is also obligated to reimburse GNAC for certain expenses incurred by GNAC in connection with the New Jersey online gaming business, such as New Jersey licensing costs, regulatory fees, certain gaming taxes and other expenses incurred by GNAC directly in connection with GNOG LLC’s operations in New Jersey. The A&R Online Gaming Operations Agreement has a term of five years commencing from April 2020 and is renewable by GNOG LLC for an additional five-year term. The A&R Online Gaming Operations Agreement also provides for, among other things, (a) minimum performance standards under which GNOG LLC is required to operate the Golden Nugget online gaming business, and (b) an arms-length risk allocation framework (including with respect to insurance and indemnification obligations).

Other Agreements. Pursuant to the Services Agreement, GNAC and Golden Nugget have agreed to provide certain services and facilities, including payroll, accounting, financial planning and other agreed upon services, to GNOG LLC from time to time and GNOG LLC has agreed to provide continued management, consulting and administrative services to Golden Nugget’s applicable subsidiary in connection with retail sports wagering conducted and such subsidiary’s brick-and-mortar casino. Under this agreement, each party is responsible for its own expenses and the employer of any shared employee is responsible for such shared employee’s total compensation. GNOG LLC is also obligated to reimburse the party providing the service or facilities at cost. In addition, at Closing, GNOG LLC entered into the Office Leases with Golden Nugget, GNAC and/or their respective affiliates for the use of certain office space in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and Houston, Texas.
Agreement with Danville Development. On November 18, 2020, GNOG LLC entered into a definitive agreement with Danville Development, LLC (“Danville Development”) for market access to the State of Illinois. Danville Development is a joint venture between Wilmot Gaming Illinois, LLC and GN Danville, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Golden Nugget and an affiliate of GNOG LLC, formed to build a new Golden Nugget branded casino in Danville, Illinois, pending obtaining all regulatory approvals. GN Danville, LLC will own a 25% equity interest in Danville Development and has an option to purchase the other equity interests in the future at a price to be determined pursuant to the definitive agreement. The definitive agreement has a term of 20 years and requires GNOG LLC to pay Danville Development a percentage of its online net gaming revenue, subject to minimum royalty payments over the term. In addition, under the definitive agreement, GNOG LLC holds the exclusive right to offer online sports wagering and, if permitted by law in the future, online casino wagering. GNOG LLC has committed to cause to be provided a mezzanine loan in the amount of $30.0 million to Danville Development, which will indirectly benefit GN Danville, LLC, for the development and construction of the casino.
Seasoned Management Team of Industry Experts
 
We are led by a seasoned management team of industry experts that enable the company to continue to achieve success in the online gaming space. Tilman Fertitta, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, has established himself as one of the preeminent businessmen in the United States regardless of industry focus. Mr. Fertitta has an extensive track record in the consumer, hospitality and gaming sectors with over 30 years of experience. Thomas Winter, our President, is a gaming industry veteran and has served as Senior Vice-President and General Manager of the online gaming division of Landry’s LLC for seven years. Prior to Landry’s LLC, Mr. Winter served as Chief Executive Officer of Betclic, a major European online sports betting and gaming operator, which merged with Expekt.com.
Best-In-Class Customer Support
 
We strive to provide our patrons with a best-in-class customer support network and unparalleled service. We believe that this commitment to excellent customer service has enabled us to retain more of our acquired players by offering users the live support needed to facilitate an enjoyable online gaming experience. Our customer service representatives, who are available via phone, live chat, email and help center 24 hours of the day, seven days a week, have an average of three years of experience in the online gaming industry, providing users with a knowledgeable network of professionals to facilitate connectivity with our interface, answer questions and improve user play. Our commitment to our customers has resulted in superb customer support reviews.
 
Based on a survey of over 27,000 customers, we earned a customer satisfaction rate of 96% in 2019. Based on our bi-weekly statistics that we reported to the DGE, in 2019 our inbound answer rate for customer calls was 95%, meaning that 95% of customer calls were answered by a live customer support agent before going to voicemail.

Short-Term Growth Plan and Opportunities
 
Currently, we are targeting Pennsylvania, Illinois, West Virginia and Virginia as states we plan to enter in the near future, subject to regulatory approvals. However, as the legalization of iGaming expands in the U.S., we intend to evaluate the financial viability of entering other new markets. We commenced operations in Michigan in January 2021.
 
Michigan
 
We began offering iGaming and online sports betting in Michigan in January 2021 through an arrangement with a licensed Tribal casino. According to the Michigan Lawful Internet Gaming Act, as of December 31, 2020, Michigan has authorized up to 15 licenses for iGaming (three commercial land-based casinos and 12 Tribes), and the applicable Michigan law allows for only one iGaming operating brand per licensee.
 
On June 17, 2020, we entered into a market access agreement with Keweenaw Bay Indian Community, a federally recognized Indian tribe (“KBIC”), pursuant to which KBIC agreed to grant us the right operate a “Golden Nugget” branded online casino (including, at our discretion, online poker) and online sportsbook in the State of Michigan under KBIC’s casino license held in connection with KBIC’s ownership of the Ojibwa Casinos located in Baraga, Michigan and Marquette, Michigan. The initial term is 15 years with an optional ten-year renewal period. 
 
Pennsylvania
 
We and GNL are pursuing regulatory approvals to enter the iGaming market in Pennsylvania. iGaming was legalized in Pennsylvania in July 2019, shortly after the legalization of online sports betting in that state in November 2018. As of December 31, 2020, there are 11 total licenses (primary and Qualified Gaming Entity (as defined below)) available in the Pennsylvania market for online gaming operators, with no limits on skins (as defined below). According to the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board, in December 2020, there were 10 licenses operating iGaming under 13 different brands in Pennsylvania generating approximately $68.9 million in aggregate gaming revenues.
 
We are seeking regulatory approvals to be licensed as a “Qualified Gaming Entity” in Pennsylvania, and as a result will not be subject to market access royalties. As a Qualified Gaming Entity, we will also have the option, subject to regulatory approvals, to partner with competing online gaming companies (“skins”) in a revenue share arrangement. The estimated cost of the online slots and online table gaming certificates necessary to offer online casino games in Pennsylvania is $8.0 million. Pending issuance of the appropriate licenses and approvals, we currently expect to launch our iGaming operations in Pennsylvania in late third quarter or early fourth quarter of 2021.

Illinois
 
We are pursuing online sports betting, and once legalized, iGaming in Illinois through an arrangement with Danville Development, LLC (“Danville Development”). Danville Development is a joint venture between Wilmot Gaming Illinois, LLC and GN Danville, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Golden Nugget and an affiliate of GNOG LLC, formed to build a new Golden Nugget branded casino in Danville, Illinois, pending obtaining all regulatory approvals. Online sports betting was legalized in Illinois in June 2019. According to amended Senate Bill 690, as of December 31, 2020, Illinois has authorized up to 22 statewide licenses for online sports betting (10 existing casinos, 6 new casinos, 3 racetracks and 3 untethered), and the applicable Illinois law allows for only one brand per licensee.
 
On November 18, 2020, we entered into a market access agreement with Danville Development, LLC which will give us the exclusive right to offer online sports wagering and, if permitted by future legislation, iGaming wagering in the State of Illinois. The initial term of the agreement between us and Danville Development, LLC is 20 years and requires GNOG LLC to pay a percentage of its online net gaming revenue, subject to minimum royalty payments over the term. In addition, we have committed to cause to be provided a mezzanine loan in the amount of $30.0 million to Danville Development, LLC for the development and construction of the casino. Pending issuance of the appropriate licenses and approvals, we currently expect to launch our online sports betting operations in Illinois by the end of 2021.
 
West Virginia
 
We are pursuing iGaming and online sports betting in West Virginia through an arrangement with Greenbrier Hotel Corporation. Online sports betting was legalized in West Virginia in March 2018 and iGaming in March 2019. According to the West Virginia Lottery Interactive Wagering Act and the West Virginia Lottery Sports Wagering Act, as of December 31, 2020, West Virginia has authorized up to 5 statewide licenses for online sports betting and iGaming each, and the applicable West Virginia laws allow for three brands per licensee.
 
On November 20, 2020, we entered into a market access agreement with Greenbrier Hotel Corporation which will give us the right to offer online sports wagering and iGaming wagering in the State of West Virginia. The agreement is for 10 years and will allow us to use the “Golden Nugget” brand. As part of the agreement, we GNOG LLC will be paying a percentage of its online net gaming revenue, subject to making minimum royalty payments to Greenbrier Hotel Corporation over the term. Pending issuance of the appropriate licenses and approvals, GNOG currently expects to launch its iGaming and online sports betting operations in West Virginia by the end of the second quarter of 2021.
 
New Jersey
 
We also plan to continue investing heavily in our New Jersey online gaming operations to retain market share and continue to acquire new high value customers. While we are a market leader in the New Jersey iGaming market, our management believes the potential for growing our share of the online sports betting market represents a lucrative opportunity based on our management’s estimates that the online sports betting market in New Jersey will be $800.0 million by 2025 as measured by gaming revenues. Based on a report released by the DGE on January 13, 2021, there are seven iGaming permit holders in New Jersey. Each holder of an iGaming permit may grant up to five iGaming skins and each holder of a sports wagering license may grant up to three online sports wagering skins.
Intellectual Property
 
We do not currently own any registered intellectual property. Our intellectual property portfolio consists substantially of licensed intellectual property, including the “GOLDEN NUGGET” trademarks licensed pursuant to the Trademark License Agreement with Golden Nugget and GNLV, each of which are our affiliates.
 
Pursuant to the Trademark License Agreement, GNLV granted GNOG LLC an exclusive license to use certain “GOLDEN NUGGET” trademarks (and other trademarks related to its business) and domain names, including goldennuggetcasino.com, solely in connection with online real money casino gambling and sports wagering in the U.S. and any of its territories.

In addition to the intellectual property licensed by GNOG LLC under the Trademark License Agreement, we license certain third-party intellectual property (such as our platform and/or games) under licenses and service agreements with those third parties to operate our online real money casino gambling and sports wagering business, including through agreements with gaming content creators and service providers. Although we believe the licenses under the Trademark License Agreement and these third-party agreements are sufficient for the operation of our business, these licenses limit the use of the licensed intellectual property in specific manners and for specific time periods and we rely entirely on such rights granted by third parties or affiliates to operate our business. We may also rely in part on the counterparties to the Trademark License Agreement and such other third-party agreements to appropriately register, protect and defend the licensed intellectual property.
 
Companies in the gaming, sports betting, casino, technology and other industries may own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and trademarks and may frequently request license agreements, threaten litigation or file suit against us based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or other violations of intellectual property rights. From time to time, we may face allegations by third parties, including our competitors and non-practicing entities, that we have infringed, misappropriated, or otherwise violated their trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, patents and other intellectual property rights. As our business grows, we will likely face more claims of infringement.
 
Government Regulation
 
We are subject to various U.S. and foreign laws and regulations that affect our ability to operate in the iGaming and sports betting industries. These industries are generally subject to extensive and evolving regulations that could change based on political and social norms and that could be interpreted in ways that could negatively impact our business.
 
The gaming industry, which includes iGaming and sports betting, is heavily regulated and in order to continue our operations, we must maintain licenses and pay gaming taxes or a percentage of revenue in each jurisdiction from which we operate. Our business is subject to extensive regulation under the laws, rules and regulations of the jurisdictions from which we operate. These laws, rules and regulations generally concern the responsibility, financial stability, integrity and character of the owners, managers and persons with material financial interests in gaming operations, along with the integrity and security of our iGaming and sports betting offerings. Violations of laws or regulations in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in that and other jurisdictions.
 
Gaming laws are generally based upon declarations of public policy designed to protect gaming consumers and the viability and integrity of the gaming industry. Gaming laws also may be designed to protect and maximize state and local tax revenues, as well as to enhance economic development and tourism. To accomplish these public policy goals, gaming laws establish stringent procedures to ensure that participants in the gaming industry meet certain standards of character and responsibility. Among other things, gaming laws require gaming industry participants to:
 

• | ensure that unsuitable individuals and organizations have no role in gaming operations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | establish procedures designed to prevent cheating and fraudulent practices;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | establish and maintain anti-money laundering practices and procedures;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | establish and maintain responsible accounting practices and procedures;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | maintain effective controls over their financial practices, including establishing minimum procedures for internal fiscal affairs and the safeguarding of assets and revenues;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | maintain systems for reliable record keeping;
--+----------------------------------------------


• | file periodic reports with gaming regulators;
--+----------------------------------------------


• | establish programs to promote responsible gaming; and
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | enforce minimum age requirements.
--+----------------------------------

Typically, a state regulatory environment is established by statute and underlying regulations and is administered by one or more regulatory agencies (typically a gaming commission or state lottery) who regulate the affairs of owners, managers and persons with financial interests in gaming operations. Among other things, gaming authorities in the various jurisdictions in which we conduct or intend to conduct our business:
 

• | adopt rules and regulations under the implementing statutes;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | interpret and enforce gaming laws and regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | impose fines and penalties for violations;
--+-------------------------------------------


• | review the character and fitness of participants in gaming operations and make determinations regarding their suitability or qualification for licensure;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | grant licenses for participation in gaming operations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | collect and review reports and information submitted by participants in gaming operations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | review and approve certain transactions, which may include acquisitions or change-of-control transactions of gaming industry participants and securities offerings and debt transactions in which such participants engage; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | establish and collect fees and taxes in jurisdictions where applicable.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
While we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable iGaming and sports betting laws, licenses and regulatory requirements, we cannot assure that our activities or the activities of our users will not become the subject of any regulatory or law enforcement investigation, proceeding or other governmental action or that any such proceeding or action, as the case may be, would not have a material adverse impact on us or our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 
Licensing and Suitability Determinations
 
In order to operate in certain jurisdictions, we must obtain either a temporary or permanent license or determination of suitability from the responsible authorities. We seek to ensure that we obtain all necessary licenses to develop and put forth our offerings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and where our users are located.
 
Gaming laws require us, and often each of our holding and intermediary companies as well as subsidiaries, certain of our directors, officers and employees, and in some cases, certain of our shareholders, to obtain licenses from, or found suitable by, gaming authorities. Licenses and suitability findings require a determination that the applicant is qualified. Where not mandated by statute, rule or regulation, gaming authorities typically have broad discretion in determining who must apply for a license or finding of suitability and whether an applicant qualifies for licensing or should be deemed suitable to conduct operations within a given jurisdiction. When determining to grant a license to an applicant, gaming authorities generally consider: (i) the financial stability, integrity, responsibility and suitability of the applicant and its applicable affiliated entities and individuals (including verification of the applicant’s sources of funding); (ii) the quality and security of the applicant’s online real-money gaming platform, hardware and related software, including the platform’s ability to operate in compliance with local regulation, as applicable; (iii) the applicant’s history; (iv) the applicant’s ability to operate its gaming business in a socially responsible manner; and (v) in certain circumstances, the effect on competition.
 
Gaming authorities may, subject to certain administrative procedural requirements, (i) deny an application, or limit, condition, revoke or suspend any license issued, or suitability finding made, by them; (ii) impose fines, either on a mandatory basis or as a consensual settlement of regulatory action; (iii) demand that named individuals or shareholders be disassociated from a gaming business; and (iv) in serious cases, liaise with local prosecutors to pursue legal action, which may result in civil or criminal penalties.

Events that may trigger revocation of a gaming license or another form of sanction vary by jurisdiction. However, typical events include, among others: (i) conviction in any jurisdiction of certain persons with an interest in, or key personnel of, the licensee of an offense that is punishable by imprisonment or may otherwise cast doubt on such person’s integrity; (ii) failure to comply with any material term or condition of the gaming license; (iii) declaration of, or otherwise engaging in, certain bankruptcy, insolvency, winding-up or discontinuance activities, or an order or application with respect to the same; (iv) obtaining the gaming license by a materially false or misleading representation or in some other improper way; (v) violation of applicable anti-money laundering or terrorist financing laws or regulations; (vi) failure to meet commitments to users, including social responsibility commitments; (vii) failure to pay in a timely manner all gaming or betting taxes or fees due; or (viii) determination by the gaming authority that there is another material and sufficient reason to revoke or impose another form of sanction upon the licensee.
 
As noted above, in addition to us and our direct and indirect holding companies and subsidiaries, gaming authorities generally also have the right to investigate individuals or entities having a material relationship to, or material involvement with, us or any of our affiliates, to determine whether such individual or entity is suitable as a business associate. Specifically, as part of our obtaining iGaming and sportsbook licenses, certain of our officers, directors, and employees and in some cases, certain of our shareholders (typically, beneficial owners of more than 5% of a company’s outstanding equity, with most jurisdictions providing that “institutional investors” (as defined by a particular jurisdiction) can seek a waiver of these requirements) must file applications with the gaming authorities and may be required to be licensed or to qualify or be found suitable in many jurisdictions. Qualification and suitability determinations generally require the submission of extensive and detailed personal and financial disclosures followed by a thorough investigation. The applicant must pay all the costs of the investigation. Changes with respect to the individuals who occupy licensed positions must be reported to gaming authorities and in addition to the authority to deny an application for licensure, qualification, or a finding of suitability, gaming authorities have jurisdiction to disapprove a change in a corporate position. If any director, officer, employee or significant shareholder is found unsuitable (including due to the failure to submit required documentation) by a gaming authority, we may deem it necessary, or be required, to sever our relationship with such person. Furthermore, the charter provides that any of our capital stock owned or controlled by an unsuitable person or its affiliates is transferred to the Company or one or more third-party transferees, as and to the extent required by a gaming authority or deemed necessary or advisable by the Board in its sole and absolute discretion.
 
Generally, any person who fails or refuses to apply for a finding of suitability or a license within the prescribed period after being advised that it is required by gaming authorities may be denied a license or found unsuitable, as applicable. Furthermore, we may be subject to disciplinary action or our licenses may be in peril if, after we receive notice that a person is unsuitable to be a stockholder or to have any other relationship with us or any of our subsidiaries, we: (i) pay that person any dividend or interest upon our voting securities; (ii) allow that person to exercise, directly or indirectly, any voting right conferred through securities held by that person; (iii) pay remuneration in any form to that person for services rendered or otherwise; or (iv) fail to pursue all lawful efforts to require such unsuitable person to relinquish his voting securities.

iGaming. We previously operated our iGaming platform in New Jersey pursuant to a transactional waiver order issued by the DGE. We previously applied to the CCC for the issuance of a casino license as an Internet Gaming Affiliate of GNAC and for qualification of the Company as a holding company of casino licensee GNOG. We also sought qualification as a financial source of GNAC in connection with our business. On November 25, 2020, regulatory approvals were received in New Jersey for the issuance of a casino license to GNOG as an Internet Gaming Affiliate of GNAC; the Company to act as a holding company of casino licensee GNOG; and, GNOG to qualify as a financial source of GNAC. We are seeking regulatory approvals to be a “Qualified Gaming Entity” in Pennsylvania. As a Qualified Gaming Entity, we would have the option, subject to regulatory approvals, to partner with competing online gaming companies (“skins”) in a revenue share arrangement. We have also entered into an agreement with a Tribal casino in Michigan, which allows us to conduct our iGaming operations under the Tribe’s license pursuant to a revenue share arrangement. We have also recently executed similar agreements in Illinois and West Virginia. Generally, online gambling in the United States is only lawful when specifically permitted under applicable state law. At the federal level, several laws provide federal law enforcement with the authority to enforce and prosecute gambling operations conducted in violation of underlying state gambling laws. These enforcement laws include the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act (the “UIGEA”), the Illegal Gambling Business Act and the Travel Act. No violation of the UIGEA, the Illegal Gambling Business Act or the Travel Act can be found absent a violation of an underlying state law or other federal law. In addition, the Wire Act of 1961 (the “Wire Act”) provides that anyone engaged in the business of betting or wagering knowingly uses a wire communication facility for the transmission in interstate or foreign commerce of bets or wagers or information assisting in the placing of bets or wagers on any sporting event or contest, or for the transmission of a wire communication which entitles the recipient to receive money or credit as a result of bets or wagers, or for information assisting in the placing of bets or wagers, will be fined or imprisoned, or both. However, the Wire Act notes that it shall not be construed to prevent the transmission in interstate or foreign commerce of information for use in news reporting of sporting events or contests, or for the transmission of information assisting in the placing of bets or wagers on a sporting event or contest from a State or foreign country where betting on that sporting event or contest is legal into a State or foreign country in which such betting is legal. There is ongoing legal action as to whether the Wire Act applies beyond sports betting. A federal court of first instance has ruled that it does not.
 
Sportsbook. We previously operated our online sports betting platform in New Jersey pursuant to the transactional waiver order referenced above. On November 25, 2020, we obtained regulatory approval in New Jersey for the issuance of a casino license to GNOG as an Internet Gaming Affiliate of GNAC. Our agreement with a Tribal casino in Michigan and our market access agreements in Illinois and West Virginia will also allow us to conduct future online sports betting operations in those states. On May 14, 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court issued an opinion determining that the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 (“PASPA”) was unconstitutional. PASPA prohibited a state from “authorizing by law” any form of sports betting. In striking down PASPA, the Supreme Court opened the potential for state-by-state authorization of sports betting. Several states and territories, including Arkansas, Colorado, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Mississippi, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Washington, D.C. and West Virginia already have laws authorizing and regulating some form of sports betting online or in brick- and-mortar establishments. Sports betting in the United States is subject to additional laws, rules and regulations at the state level.
Data Protection and Privacy
 
Because we handle, collect, store, receive, transmit and otherwise process certain personal information of our users and employees, we are also subject to federal, state and foreign laws related to the privacy and protection of such data. The regulatory framework for privacy issues is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future.
Competition
 
Given that the U.S. online gaming market is vast and rapidly expanding, we believe any company competing for the time and disposable income of customers within such market to be a competitor. Currently there are several online gaming companies in the U.S. that provide iGaming, online sports betting, or both, including, but not limited to, DraftKings, FanDuel, Betfair, Caesars Entertainment, BetMGM, Roar Digital, Penn National Gaming and Rush Street Interactive. We currently compete with FanDuel, DraftKings, Caesars Entertainment, Roar Digital, Rush Street Interactive and Hard Rock, among others, in New Jersey and expect to compete with Rush Street Interactive, FanDuel, DraftKings, PokerStars, Kindred and Penn National Gaming, among others, in Pennsylvania and FanDuel, DraftKings, Roar Digital, Penn National Gaming and Rush Street Interactive, among others, in Michigan when it begins operations in those states. Additionally, we expect competition from new entrants over time.
 
We believe the principal competitive factors in the business include reliability, gaming offerings, the ability to acquire and retain users, regulatory compliance, market access, brand equity, customer service, and innovation.
