Substantially all of our revenue has historically been attributable to our Video Cloud product, and we expect that revenue from Video Cloud will continue to comprise a significant portion of our revenue. 
 Our Solutions 
 Our solutions provide our customers with the following key benefits: 
 

 | Comprehensive, modular and scalable solutions. Video Cloud provides a single, integrated solution to meet a range of video publishing and distribution needs.

 | Easy to use and low total cost of ownership. Our products were designed to be intuitive and easy to use. We provide reliable, cost-effective, on-demand solutions to our customers, relieving them of the cost, time and resources associated with in-house solutions and enabling them to be up and running quickly after signing with us.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Open platforms and extensive ecosystem. Our open and extensible platforms enable our customers to customize standard features and functionality and easily integrate third-party technology to meet their own specific requirements and business objectives. We have an extensive ecosystem of partners, which we refer to as the Brightcove Partner Program. More than 150 members of the Brightcove Partner Program have built solutions that rely upon, or are already integrated with, our platforms. This ecosystem includes leading technology companies such as Akamai, comScore, Google and Oracle and providers of niche technology services.

 | Help customers achieve business objectives. Our customers use our products to achieve key business objectives such as driving site traffic, increasing viewer engagement on their sites, monetizing content, increasing conversion rates for transactions, increasing brand awareness and expanding their audiences, internal communications, employee training and customer support. We believe our customers view us as a strategic partner in part because our business model is not dependent on building our own audience or generating our own ad revenue. Our business interests align with our customers interests as we each benefit from the success of our customers online strategy.

 | Ongoing customer-driven development. Through our account managers, customer support teams, product teams and regular outreach from senior leadership, we solicit and capture feedback from our customer base for incorporation into ongoing enhancements to our solutions. We regularly provide our customers with enhancements to our products. For example, in 2016 we introduced Brightcove Social, which allows customers to manage their video presence across social networks from a single interface, we launched OTT Flow, we added support for 4K Ultra High-Definition (UHD) content in Zencoder, we added a Salesforce integration to Brightcove Audience, which is used to send video engagement data to popular marketing automation platforms, and added support for 360-degree video in the Brightcove video player.

These professional services are priced on a time and materials basis or a per project basis and include projects such as content migrations from other vendors or in-house solutions, video player enhancements and the creation of web pages optimized for video. 
 
9 
 
Support 
 Our products generally include basic support for technical and operational issues. The premium editions of our products generally include telephone support during normal business hours. We also offer 24/7 global telephone support to customers paying for premium support packages.
Training 
 We offer free basic online training to registered users of our products. We also offer customized, onsite training for customers that is priced on a per engagement basis. 
Sales and Marketing 
 We sell our products primarily through our global direct sales organization. Our sales team is organized by the following geographic regions: Americas, Europe and the Middle East, Asia Pacific, and Japan. We further organize our go-to-market approach by focusing our sales and marketing teams on selling primarily to (i) media companies, who generally want to distribute video content to a broad audience and (ii) digital marketers in a wide range of enterprises and organizations, who generally use video for marketing or communication purposes. A small amount of sales are generated through referral partners, channel partners and resellers. We also sell some of our products online through our website. 
 We generate customer leads, accelerate sales opportunities and build brand awareness through our marketing programs. Our marketing programs target executives, technology professionals and senior business leaders. Like our sales teams, our marketing team and programs are organized by geography and industry segment. Our principal marketing programs include: 
 

 | public relations and social media;
--+-----------------------------------


 | online event marketing activities, direct email, search engine marketing and display ads and blogs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | field marketing events for customers and prospects;
--+----------------------------------------------------


 | participation in, and sponsorship of, user conferences, trade shows and industry events;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | use of our website to provide product and organization information, as well as learning opportunities for potential customers;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | cooperative marketing efforts with partners, including joint press announcements, joint trade show activities, channel marketing campaigns and joint seminars;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | telemarketing and lead generation representatives who respond to incoming leads to convert them into new sales opportunities; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | customer programs, including user meetings and our online customer community.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Operations 
 We operate data center facilities in the greater Boston area and the greater Chicago area, and also use third-party cloud computing platforms. We operate our own servers for systems that manage meta-data, business rules and archival storage of media assets. We take advantage of geographically dispersed, third-party, cloud computing capacity to improve the responsiveness of our service and lower network latency for our customers. 
 Media delivery to end users, including video, audio, images and JavaScript components, is served primarily through CDN providers, including Akamai and Limelight. We believe our agreements with our CDN providers are based on competitive market terms and conditions, including service level commitments from these CDN providers. 
 We entered into our agreement with Akamai in July 2010. It enables us to use Akamai CDN services for our own benefit and to resell Akamai CDN services to our customers in every geographic location in which we offer our products. The current expiration date of the agreement is December 31, 2019.
 
10 
 
We entered into our agreement with Limelight in March 2006. Our agreement with Limelight enables us to use Limelight CDN services for our own benefit and to resell Limelight CDN services to our customers in every geographic location in which we offer our products. The current expiration date of the agreement is April 30, 2017. We believe the agreement will be renewed or the term of the agreement will be extended again prior to the expiration of the service continuation period described below. 
 Each agreement contains a service continuation period following expiration of the agreement, which we believe is sufficient to enable transition to an alternative provider to avoid material disruption to our business or to our customers. Our agreement with Akamai provides that, upon termination for any reason, Akamai will continue to provide CDN services to our existing customers for up to twelve months. Our agreement with Limelight provides that, upon termination for any reason, Limelight will continue to provide CDN services for our benefit for up to six months. 
 Intellectual Property 
 We rely principally on a combination of trademark, patent, copyright and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology, confidential information, business strategies and brands. We also believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our employees coupled with the creation of new features, functionality and products are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position. We enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and confidentiality agreements with other third parties, and we rigorously control access to our proprietary technology. 
 In the United States, we have 31 issued and/or allowed patents and 11 patent applications pending. Internationally, we have 13 issued and/or allowed patents and 21 patent applications pending, including two patent applications undergoing examination at the European Patent Office. We currently have patent applications pending in Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, Hong Kong and Japan, and we may seek coverage in additional jurisdictions to the extent we determine such coverage is appropriate and cost-effective. Our issued patents cover a variety of technical domains relevant to our business, including aspects of publishing and distributing digital media online, cloud-based stream delivery and ad insertion. 
 Our registered trademarks in the United States include BRIGHTCOVE, ZENCODER, ONCEVOD and our logo. These trademarks are also registered in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, including the European Union and Canada. We may apply for registrations for these and other marks in additional jurisdictions to the extent we determine such coverage is appropriate and cost-effective. 
 Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology to develop products with the same functionality as our solutions. Policing unauthorized use of our technology is difficult and expensive. Our competitors could also independently develop technologies equivalent to ours, and our intellectual property rights may not be broad enough for us to prevent competitors from selling products incorporating those technologies. 
 Competition 
 We compete with video-sharing sites such as YouTube, in-house solutions, online video platforms and a broad range of other technology providers. Some of our actual and potential competitors may enjoy competitive advantages over us, such as larger marketing budgets and larger sales teams, as well as greater financial, technical and other resources. The overall markets for our products are fragmented, rapidly evolving and highly competitive. 
 
11 
 
We expect that the competitive landscape will change as our markets consolidate and mature. We believe the principal competitive factors in our industry include the following: 
 

 | total cost of ownership;
--+-------------------------


 | breadth and depth of product functionality;
--+--------------------------------------------


 | ability to innovate and respond to customer needs rapidly;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


 | level of resources and investment in sales, marketing, product and technology;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | ease of deployment and use of solutions;
--+-----------------------------------------


 | level of integration into existing workflows, configurability, scalability and reliability;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | customer service;
--+------------------


 | brand awareness and reputation;
--+--------------------------------


 | ability to integrate with third-party applications and technologies;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


 | size and scale of provider; and
--+--------------------------------


 | size of customer base and level of user adoption.
--+--------------------------------------------------

 The mix of factors relevant in any given situation varies with regard to each prospective customer. We believe we compete favorably with respect to all of these factors. 
 Some of our competitors have made or may make acquisitions or enter into partnerships or other strategic relationships to offer a more comprehensive service than we do. These combinations may make it more difficult for us to compete effectively, including on the basis of price, sales and marketing programs, technology or service functionality. We expect these trends to continue as organizations attempt to strengthen or maintain their market positions. 
 Research and Development 
 We have focused our research and development efforts on expanding the functionality and scalability of our products and enhancing their ease of use, as well as creating new product offerings. We expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we intend to continue to regularly release new features and functionality, expand our product offerings, continue the localization of our products in various languages, upgrade and extend our service offerings, and develop new technologies. Over the long term, we believe that research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue will decrease, but will vary depending upon the mix of revenue from new and existing products, features and functionality, as well as changes in the technology that our products must support, such as new operating systems or new Internet-connected devices. 
 Our research and development expenses were $30.2 million, $29.3 million and $28.3 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which included stock-based compensation expense of $1.3 million, $1.4 million and $1.4 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, we had 159 employees in research and development. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2016, we had 490 employees, of which 382 were located in the United States and 108 were located outside of the United States. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
