Item 1. BUSINESS 
GENERAL 
 AVITA Medical, Inc. (“AVITA” or the “Company”, and its subsidiaries, including AVITA Medical Pty Limited (“AVITA Medical”), the former parent company, (collectively, “AVITA Group” or “we”, “us”)) is a regenerative medicine company that is developing and commercializing a technology platform that enables point-of-care autologous skin restoration for multiple unmet needs. Our patented and proprietary platform technology provides innovative treatment solutions derived from the regenerative properties of a patient’s own skin. Our RECELL® Autologous Cell Harvesting System (“RECELL System” or “RECELL”) enables clinicians to prepare Spray-On Skin™ Cells, an autologous skin cell suspension that is sprayed onto the patient to regenerate natural healthy skin.   
 CORPORATE
 AVITA Medical, the former parent company of the AVITA Group, began as a laboratory spin-off in the Australian State of Western Australia.  AVITA Medical was formed under the laws of the Commonwealth of Australia in December 1992 and has operated as AVITA Medical since 2008. AVITA Medical’s ordinary shares originally began trading in Australia on the Australian Securities Exchange (“ASX”) on August 9, 1993. AVITA Medical’s American Depositary Shares (“ADSs”) traded over the counter on the OTCQX under the ticker symbol “AVMXY” from May 14, 2012 through September 30, 2019 and its ADSs began trading on the NASDAQ on October 1, 2019, under the ticker symbol “RCEL”. 
 On June 29, 2020, a statutory scheme of arrangement under Australian law to effect a redomiciliation of the AVITA Group from Australia to the United States of America was implemented (the “Redomiciliation”). The Redomiciliation was approved by shareholders on June 15, 2020 and approved by the Federal Court of Australia on June 22, 2020. 
 Pursuant to the Redomiciliation, all ordinary shares in AVITA Medical, the former parent company of the AVITA Group, were exchanged for shares of common stock in the Company.  As a result, the Company became the sole shareholder of AVITA Medical and the new parent company of the AVITA Group.  In conjunction with the Redomiciliation, an implicit consolidation or reverse split on a 1 for 100 basis was implemented whereby shareholders of AVITA Medical received one share of common stock in the Company for every 100 shares held in AVITA Medical. 
 Under the Redomiciliation, eligible shareholders in AVITA Medical received consideration in the form of :
  
• | five CHESS Depositary Interests (“CDIs”) in the Company for every 100 ordinary shares in AVITA Medical that were held by them; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | one share of common stock in the Company for every 5 ADSs in AVITA Medical that were held by them.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Company’s CDI’s are quoted on the ASX under AVITA Medical’s former ASX ticker code, “AVH”. The Company’s shares of common stock are quoted on NASDAQ under AVITA Medical’s former NASDAQ ticker code, “RCEL”. One share of common stock on NASDAQ is equivalent to five CDIs on the ASX.
 As a result of the ‘implicit consolidation’ that occurred under the Redomiciliation, the number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding in the Company (as set out in the consolidated financial statements) is less than the number of ordinary shares in AVITA Medical that was set out in the consolidated financial statements of AVITA Medical prior to August 28, 2020.  
 COVID-19 IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS
 The coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic has created significant disruptions to the global economies and financial markets.  In the United States, State and Local Governmental authorities have responded by issuing orders, of varying degrees, requiring quarantines, restrictions on travel, mandatory closures of certain non-essential businesses, as well as providing recommendations to minimize social gatherings or interactions. The Company’s business and operations have been impacted by COVID-19 as the effects of COVID-19 related travel restrictions have reduced accidents and the incidence of burns and burns admissions.  In addition, during the pandemic, our commercial team’s access to hospitals was limited to case attendance and training. As COVID-19 abates and the restrictions are lifted, we anticipate that burn related accidents will resume to pre-COVID levels. In response to the pandemic, we have taken certain business measures which include institution of various workplace protections to ensure the safety of our employees (e.g., 
 2


wearing of masks, wiping down high touch areas, etc.), and the limiting of vendors and visitors to our facilities. We have limited activities at our corporate headquarters, encouraged our employees to work from home, encouraged virtual meetings, restricted non-essential business travel, made physical modifications and enhancements to our facilities to effect social distancing, and provided personal protective equipment to our employees. We have increased safety stocks of our product, established temporary satellite product storage locations, and accelerated initiatives to increase sourcing options. Throughout the pandemic, we have remained focused on managing the business for the long-term, including maintaining our employee workforce as well as continuing to invest in critical research and development, clinical, and corporate infrastructure-related programs.
 STRATEGY
 Our objective is to become the leading provider of regenerative medicine addressing unmet medical needs in burn injuries, trauma injuries, and in dermatological and aesthetics indications, including vitiligo as well as cell and gene therapies. To achieve this objective, we intend to:

--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RECELL® PLATFORM
 The RECELL System has a long-established safety profile, and clear potential for clinical and health-economic value propositions across a range of skin-related clinical indications. The patented and proprietary platform technology underlying Spray-On Skin Cells originated in Australia, based on the seminal work of Professor Fiona Wood and fellow scientist Marie Stoner. RECELL was initially launched in the E.U. during 2005, and then in Australia in 2006, ahead of pivotal outcomes data demonstrating clinical performance relative to standard care. Pivotal trials were conducted in the U.S. beginning in 2010. On September 2018 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approved the Class 3 device through a premarket approval (“PMA”) for the treatment of acute thermal burn injuries in patients 18 years and older.  Following receipt of our PMA, we commenced promoting the RECELL System in January 2019 in the U.S.  RECELL is a first-of-kind medical device approved through FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, and the first Class 3 device approved for use in burn care in over 20 years. 
 The RECELL System is a single use (disposable), stand-alone, battery operated, autologous cell harvesting device containing enzymatic and buffer solutions, sterile surgical instruments, and actuators to achieve the disaggregation and delivery of skin cells.  The platform technology of the RECELL System allows for the preparation and delivery of Spray-On Skin Cells, an autologous cellular suspension comprised of the patient’s own skin cells necessary to regenerate natural healthy epidermis. These Spray-On Skin Cells are prepared at the point of care in as little as 30 minutes, providing a new way to treat thermal burns, other wounds, skin injuries or 
 3


defects of the skin. The skin cell suspension includes keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and melanocytes, all of which play critical roles in skin regeneration. The treatment of burns with RECELL yields proven and significant reduction in the harvesting of donor skin. Donor sites are of great concern amongst burn patients. Burn wounds treated using RECELL show comparable results in burn wound healing outcomes relative to conventional grafting, despite the use of 32.0-97.5% less donor site tissue. The ability of RECELL to retain melanocytes in the cell suspension is notable as these cells are critical for the restoration of natural pigmentation to the area treated, which is being further evaluated in ongoing clinical trials. Skin cell suspension is a powerful therapeutic with the potential for addressing unmet needs in a number of clinical indications, including burns, soft tissue reconstruction, and vitiligo. 
  RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT 
 The launch of the RECELL System into the U.S. market provided an opportunity to gain valuable, in-depth insight into the patient care pathway, as well as the workflow for surgical management of burn wounds. We continue to commit significant and increasing resources in product development to ensure that our device continues to evolve and has robust patent protection. The next iteration of the RECELL System is currently under review with the FDA and will present a more streamlined workflow for enhanced ease-of-use in the clinical setting, while producing the same autologous skin cell suspension. This new version of the RECELL System is expected to be commercialized in the first half of calendar year 2022 and will offer improved convenience along with an opportunity to expand our intellectual property portfolio. 
 Further product development is ongoing on a next generation device for more automated implementation of the core Spray-On Skin Cells technology, to advance the user experience toward less hands-on processing time. With each iteration of our RECELL System development, we anticipate preservation of the therapeutic power of Spray-on Skin Cells, deployed in devices that become appropriate for use in an increasing range of clinical settings. This is particularly important as we aim to enter the dermatology space, where there is a shift toward an emphasis on the volume of patients treated in a day. 
 Cell-based gene therapeutic applications are an extension of the platform, where modified skin cells are applied in suspension for regeneration of skin (from genetically corrected or molecularly reverse-aged cells). For instance, in the case of rejuvenation, rather than skin regeneration directly from the patient’s own skin cells, harvested cells are planned to undergo a process of molecular reverse aging prior to reintroduction to the patient. Similarly, for Epidermolysis Bullosa (“EB”), harvested cells are planned to undergo a gene modification process to correct the underlying defect, such that when the EB wounds are treated, skin is regenerated that does not exhibit the characteristic blistering and fragility associated with EB. 
 In summary, our research and development efforts are currently focused on: 
  
• | Further clinical development of the RECELL System in additional skin-focused clinical indications where the platform can be leveraged. Specifically, to expand our footprint within wounds and dermatology, such as soft tissue reconstruction and vitiligo. These activities are generally characterized by pivotal studies for which FDA has approved an Investigational Device Exemption (“IDE”)
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | RECELL platform technology evolution to improve workflow, speed, and ease of use
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expansion of the technology platform underlying the RECELL System into cell-based gene therapy, including combining the platform with other technologies, to allow development of the platform in other indications (including orphan indications)
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Further research and characterization of the RECELL System design and the composition and activity of the Spray-On Skin Cells suspension to support further clinical development of the platform, and to expand our intellectual property estate
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TARGET MARKETS
 Burns
 Acute thermal burns are life-threatening and debilitating injuries that are among the most challenging and expensive to manage. These injuries require complex surgical procedures, long and costly hospitalization, and have a high potential for clinical complications and requirement for rehabilitation and scar treatment. In the U.S., the largest market for the treatment of burns, approximately 486,000 people seek treatment for burns each year. Of these, at least 40,000 have burn injuries severe enough to require hospital admission, and it is estimated that 3,300 patients die each year. The majority of patients treated on an inpatient basis in the U.S. are treated in specialized burn centers. 
 Severe burns (typically defined as second- and third-degree) are commonly treated with autologous split-thickness skin grafts (“STSGs”) to achieve definitive closure of the burn wound. In a STSG, or autograft, donor skin is harvested from a healthy area of the patient’s skin. The donor skin is then typically perforated into a mesh that can be expanded and transferred to cover the prepared burn 
 4


injury. Treatment with STSG results in additional trauma for the patient due to creation of a new donor site wound. Although the use of STSG has been a standard treatment for more than 50 years, autografting is associated with significant pain, itching, infection, dyschromia, dyspigmentation, delayed healing, and hypertrophic scarring of the donor site. 
 The clinical benefits of earlier wound closure are well recognized and include increased survival, reduced hospital length of stay, decreased pain duration, and reduced infection-related complications. However, in large burn injuries, the patient may have insufficient donor skin available to allow for immediate and complete treatment of the entire burn injury area when using traditional grafting techniques. The lack of available healthy donor skin in patients with large burn injuries is often the central problem impacting time to autografting and definitive closure of the wounds. In extensively burned patients, surgeons often must wait until the donor sites have healed so they can re-harvest from the sites, resulting in delays in treatment and closure, requiring multiple procedures, and extending hospital stay. While waiting for donor skin, the burn wounds may be temporarily covered by allogeneic skin (allograft, cadaver skin) or xenograft (typically pig skin). The overall cost of treatment with STSG is expensive - for example it would cost approximately $579,000 and 59.4 days in hospital for a patient with a 40% Total Body Surface Area (“TBSA”) mixed-depth burn injury to recover and return to normal day to day activities. 
 The RECELL System was approved by the FDA in September 2018 for the treatment of second- and third-degree acute thermal burn injuries in patients 18 years and older. In June 2021, the FDA approved an expanded indication for use to also include treatment of full-thickness (third-degree) pediatric burns, which represent close to a quarter of all burn injuries in the U.S., as well as full-thickness burn injuries greater than 50% TBSA. As a result of having achieved an expanded indication for use in pediatric burns, the BARDA-funded U.S. Pediatric Burns trial has been closed to new enrollment (refer to BARDA Contract section below).
 The pivotal studies leading to the RECELL System’s FDA PMA for the treatment of acute thermal burns demonstrated that the RECELL System treated burns used 97.5 percent less donor skin when used alone in second-degree burns, and 32 percent less donor skin when used with autograft for third-degree burns, compared to standard of care autografting. In these studies, a statistically significant reduction in donor skin required to treat burn patients with the RECELL System was realized without any associated compromise to healing or safety outcomes. Donor site outcomes from the clinical trial for second-degree burns also revealed a statistically significant reduction in patient-reported pain, increased patient satisfaction and improved scar outcomes. 
 The RECELL System offers fewer procedures required for definitive closure versus conventional autografts. In pediatric cases using the RECELL System, there were 56% fewer mean surgical procedures (N = 284) compared to the American Burn Association’s National Burn Repository (“NBR”). Additionally, in patients with >50% TBSA, the RECELL System provided 60% fewer mean surgical procedures versus NBR (N =354).
 In addition to robust clinical data, RECELL has proven health economic benefits and a compelling cost-effectiveness model which shows that treatment using the RECELL System for deep partial-thickness burns reduces total treatment costs by an average of 26%, or approximately $37,000, for patients with 10% TBSA and approximately $150,000, for patients with 40% TBSA. For full-thickness burns, treatment using the RECELL System reduced total treatment cost by 3%, or approximately $6,000 for patients with 10% TBSA and by 42% or approximately $243,000, for patients with 40% TBSA. These cost reductions are attributed to decreasing the length of hospital stay, reducing the number of procedures required to close the burn wound, and minimizing the donor site size and associated wound care. All of these cost savings estimates are net of the cost of the RECELL System.
 A budget impact model was developed and has been used to calculate the annual budget impact of current standard of care for the treatment of burns versus treatment using the RECELL System for a burn center with 200 patients. The model shows that treatment using the RECELL System reduces annual total treatment costs from approximately $39.4 million to $32.6 million, saving 17% or approximately $6.8 million per year. 
 The market for treatment of burns in the U.S. is highly concentrated, with approximately 136 burn centers and approximately 300 burn surgeons who treat the majority of severe burns in the country (i.e., ~75%). Accordingly, our target market is predominantly focused on burn centers. Our goal is to establish RECELL as the standard of care for any burn injury that requires grafting for patients with 5% TBSA injury or greater. Within burn centers, we estimate that there are approximately 25,000 patients annually that could benefit from our technology and equates to a serviceable annual addressable market of ~$260 million. Each RECELL System can treat up to 10% TBSA, and many patients will require more than one device. 
 AVITA has a policy of not providing the RECELL System to a provider until they have been certified, which includes extensive training in the use of the product and in the aftercare of the patient. In general, we have found that most U.S. burn centers follow the industry-standard process of evaluating the RECELL System and then taking it through their hospital’s Value Analysis Committee (“VAC”) prior to purchasing. This process can sometimes be a lengthy one, taking 6 months or more to complete. As a result of training requirements and the VAC process, we have found that full adoption of the RECELL System among U.S. burn 
 5


centers occurs on a gradual basis, in many cases over multiple years. In general, most surgeons follow a typical adoption curve, starting from where they see the greatest economic and clinical value, which is the use of RECELL for treatment of larger burns. With time and continued use, surgeons typically progress to adoption of RECELL for smaller, less severe burns and facial burns. Each surgeon traverses the adoption curve at a different rate – some in as few as 6 months and others expected in 3-5 years.
 In the U.S., existing reimbursement codes were in place prior to the commencement of commercial sales of the RECELL System. For inpatient treatment of burn patients, U.S. hospitals are reimbursed under DRG (Diagnosis Related Group) Codes based on diagnosis of a patient’s injuries. Future expansion of use of the RECELL System for treatment of burns in the outpatient setting will require us to successfully obtain incremental reimbursement coverage for use of the RECELL System in that setting. In August 2020, we filed a Transitional Pass-through Payment Application (“TPT”) with The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) to support separate, additional Medicare payment for use of the RECELL System. If approved, CMS would create a new “C code” and would allow use of the RECELL System to be billed and paid separately in hospital outpatient facilities and ambulatory surgical centers. On July 19, 2021, CMS released the 2022 Medicare Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System proposed rule which contained a review of RECELL’s Transitional Pass-through Payment application. CMS is inviting public comment on whether the RECELL System meets the device pass-through payment criteria discussed in the document. The Company expects to be informed of CMS’s decision on our TPT submission towards the end of December 2021, with the code expected to go into effect in early 2022. Importantly, the Company will then need to work with commercial carriers to ensure broader coverage once the code has been granted. The TPT code is not indication specific, so as AVITA gains approval of additional indications outside of acute thermal burn treatment, the same code will apply. For physicians, CPT (Current Procedural Terminology) codes for use in RECELL System procedures are recommended by the American Burn Association and are the same for both inpatient and outpatient use. 
 Outside of the U.S., Japan is the second largest healthcare market.  There are approximately 6,000 patients/per year who suffer from severe burns in Japan who would be a target for the RECELL System. Large patient populations coupled with healthy reimbursement coverage makes Japan an attractive market for the RECELL System. In February 2019 we entered into a collaboration with Cosmotec Company, Ltd (“COSMOTEC”), an M3 Group company, to market and distribute the RECELL System for the treatment of burns, other wounds, and vitiligo in Japan. We continue to work with COSMOTEC to advance our application for approval to market the RECELL System in Japan pursuant to Japan’s Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Act (“PMDA”). The Company anticipates regulatory approval in Japan by the end of December 2021 and that COSMOTEC will commercially launch RECELL in Japan during calendar year 2022. Although RECELL was submitted for a broad indication for use including all acute wounds and vitiligo, it is unclear whether the PMDA will grant COSMOTEC labelling outside of burns where the Company has the most robust data.
 Given the size and concentration of the U.S. & Japanese markets, our commercial efforts are almost exclusively focused on these geographies. Our highly limited effort in other non-U.S. regions is based on our assessment that the acute burn market in many countries is proportionately less than the market in the U.S., and the investments in full marketing and sales including the effort to obtain reimbursement are not justified until we have obtained pivotal clinical results in additional indications. In Australia and Europe, the RECELL System is no longer actively promoted, and our commercialization efforts are limited to filling sales orders as received from a small group of customers previously trained in use of the product. As additional pivotal data for the RECELL System are generated in additional indications, we plan to accelerate commercialization of the RECELL System in countries outside the U.S. through a combination of collaborations and direct efforts, depending upon the region and indication. 
 Soft Tissue Reconstruction 
 Soft tissue reconstruction includes treatment of injuries caused by non-burn trauma, including excision of infected tissue, such as necrotizing soft tissue infections. While minor skin defects may be primarily closed with sutures or standard wound care, larger open defects require more complicated approaches, including skin grafts, tissue flaps and dermal matrices. 
 Similar to the burns indication, soft tissue reconstruction is associated with large areas of skin loss and as such, some of the top unmet needs identified by surgeons are closely aligned:
  
• | Reduced donor skin harvesting
--+------------------------------


• | Reduced scarring
--+-----------------


• | Reduced pain
--+-------------


• | Uniform pigmentation with surrounding skin
--+-------------------------------------------

 Given the interest to reduce donor skin harvesting, just as with the burns indication, we designed a clinical trial to demonstrate the use of less donor skin without compromising healing outcomes relative to conventional autografting. The trial is essentially a repeat of the successful previous trial in full-thickness burns, but with a population of patients with full-thickness, non-burn injuries.

On September 17, 2019, the FDA approved an Investigational Device Exemption (“IDE”) to conduct a pivotal trial evaluating the safety and effectiveness of the RECELL System in combination with meshed autografting for the treatment of acute full-thickness skin defects. Subsequently, on March 2, 2020, we initiated a prospective, multi-center, randomized controlled study for soft tissue reconstruction with the enrollment of the first patient at the Arizona Burn Center at Valleywise Medical Health Center in Phoenix, AZ. Each patient will have a control wound treated with conventional skin grafting and a wound treated with expanded skin grafting in combination with RECELL. Enrollment of this pivotal study is ongoing. As of the end of our 2021 fiscal year, we had enrolled 32 out of 65 patients and we expect enrollment to be completed during calendar year 2022.
 Open wounds associated with traumatic injuries caused over 4.5 million hospital visits in the U.S. in 2017, and traumatic wounds rank among the five most costly medical conditions. We estimate that the total annual addressable market for RECELL in soft tissue reconstruction is approximately $1 billion. Approximately 80% of our current burn accounts represent opportunities for use of RECELL in soft tissue reconstruction. We plan to build out our existing field team to cover >400 target accounts in acute wounds (representing burn and high-volume trauma accounts). As such, our estimated annual serviceable addressable market in soft tissue reconstruction is approximately $450 million. Degloving (a type of injury where the skin is ripped from the underlying tissue), abrasions and infectious disease (e.g., necrotizing soft tissue infections, like flesh-eating disease), have the greatest stated intent to use, based on market research. We believe RECELL will be used in both the inpatient & outpatient settings and in general, with wounds 5% TBSA and larger.
 From a reimbursement perspective, the same CPT (physician payment) coding that is currently being used in burns can be leveraged. Assuming we are successful securing an outpatient TPT code, this same TPT code, which is not indication specific, could be utilized for soft tissue reconstruction. 
 RECELL has been successfully used outside the U.S. for many years and there exist several case reports on the treatment of traumatic injuries (soft tissue reconstruction) that have been the subject of peer-reviewed scientific publications and presentations at medical conferences. Patients with traumatic injuries have also been treated using the RECELL System under the U.S. Compassionate Use program and although AVITA does not promote the use of RECELL in soft tissue reconstruction in the U.S., some surgeons have started successfully using the product. This is not surprising as many burn surgeons also work in Level 1/Level 2 trauma centers and treat a great deal of traumatic wounds and as mentioned earlier, acute wounds (regardless of burn or non-thermal origin) present the same unmet needs and have similar treatment protocols. In summary, soft tissue reconstruction is a significant opportunity which AVITA can pursue leveraging its existing resources. Further, this opportunity is significantly de-risked based on the historical performance of the product in this indication. 
 Vitiligo
 Vitiligo is a disease that causes the loss of skin pigmentation, or color, in patches that tend to increase in size over time. The extent and rate of color loss from vitiligo is unpredictable, can affect the skin on any part of the body, and may also affect hair and the inside of the mouth. Vitiligo occurs when melanocytes, the pigment-producing skin cells, die or stop producing melanin, the pigment that gives skin, hair, and eyes color. Vitiligo is believed to be an autoimmune disorder in which a patient’s immune system attacks and destroys the melanocytes in the skin. It may also be caused by heredity factors or a triggering event, such as sunburn, stress, or exposure to industrial chemicals. Vitiligo affects people of all skin types, but it may be more noticeable in people with darker skin. It is estimated that worldwide vitiligo prevalence is between 0.5-2% of the population. The condition is not life-threatening or physically painful, but it can significantly alter physical appearance, have negative emotional and psychological consequences, and impair quality of life. 
 Vitiligo cannot be cured at present, and medical treatments generally fall into one of two categories: 
  
1. | Treatments to arrest the spread of vitiligo, such as steroid creams and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory creams. There are also a number of therapies under development designed to target the underlying autoimmune disease. One challenge in terms of achieving the desired patient outcome is that stopping the spread of vitiligo may not restore pigmentation to the areas already damaged.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Treatments to restore pigmentation include skin grafting, laser phototherapy (with and without topicals), and Melanocyte-Keratinocyte Transplantation Procedure (“MKTP”). MKTP requires expensive and substantial laboratory equipment and is currently only available in 4 locations in the U.S.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 RECELL does not treat the underlying disease. Rather, it addresses the second category only and works to restore pigmentation. The key unmet need is a durable, one-time treatment that has potential to be scalable. MKTP has been proven to be effective but is only available in 4 U.S. locations due to complexity and the associated substantial investment in lab equipment. The procedure is also lengthy (3 hours). RECELL is a similar procedure, however, it can be done in as little as 30 minutes, in any dermatology setting. Compared to MKTP, RECELL is essentially a lab in a box that can be easily distributed.
 7


Interest in vitiligo treatment tends to increase in individuals who have lesions in more visible areas (such as the face and hands) as well as the younger population (<40). We estimate that there are approximately 1.3 million people in the U.S. with stable vitiligo who would be both eligible and interested in a surgical approach which equates to a total addressable market of over $5 billion. The RECELL treatment is initially anticipated to be provided by a vitiligo specialist and surgical dermatologist in the office setting and we estimate that this will likely not exceed 1,000 physicians. Approximately 188,000 vitiligo patients who have insurance or the ability to pay are likely at those target call points, and this equates to a serviceable market opportunity of approximately $750 million.  
 The market is expected to grow, especially over the next decade with the advent of novel treatment options including oral and topical Janus Kinase (“JAK”) inhibitors. Although these new products will both stabilize and re-pigment some patients, it is anticipated that many patients will need additional modes of treatment for re-pigmentation. Further, large pharmaceutical companies with assets in development will likely invest in disease awareness campaigns which will further grow consumer awareness and the market. 
 
On December 23, 2019, the FDA approved our IDE application to conduct a feasibility study evaluating the safety and effectiveness of the RECELL System for re-pigmentation of depigmented lesions associated with stable vitiligo. This study is a single site study being conducted at the University of Massachusetts Medical School in ten (10) patients that have had vitiligo stable for at least one year. Areas of the vitiligo lesion will be randomly treated with slightly varying cell suspensions prepared using RECELL to confirm response rates and optimal suspension parameters, as well as to compare outcomes and cell suspension characteristics with MKTP. The randomized controlled study’s primary effectiveness measure is the percent area of repigmented skin 24 weeks after treatment, as evaluated by a clinician blinded to the treatment assignment. Additional effectiveness data collected over the course of the 24-week study will include blinded evaluator categorization of treatment success and patient rating of repigmentation. The Company commenced enrollment in the vitiligo feasibility study in September 2020 and as of the end of the 2021 fiscal year had completed treatment of 5 of the 10 patients. 
 In addition to the abovementioned feasibility study, on July 1, 2020, the FDA approved our IDE application for a pivotal study in vitiligo which is titled “A Prospective Multi-Arm Blinded-Evaluator Within-Subject Randomized Controlled Clinical Study to Investigate the Safety and Effectiveness of RECELL for Repigmentation of Stable Vitiligo.” The primary endpoint compares the incidence of 80% repigmentation of RECELL-treated areas versus that of phototherapy control-treated areas. The Company commenced enrollment in the vitiligo pivotal study in September 2020 and had treated 16 patients as of June 30, 2021.  While the pivotal trial design initially had 3 separate arms evaluating the clinical performance of varying cell suspensions (1:5, 1:10, and 1:20 donor expansion), we are in discussion with FDA concerning a single-arm design to evaluate only the 1:20 cell suspension. With a single arm design, it will be possible to complete enrollment in the pivotal program during calendar year 2021.
 We expect revenue from the vitiligo business to stem from both cash pay as well as patients for whom treatment is covered by insurance. Vitiligo rates a ‘7.61’ on the Dermatology Life Quality Index (“DLQI”), which is in the same range of other aesthetic dermatological disease analogs which receive healthy positive reimbursement such as Rosacea (5.2), Psoriasis (9.3) and Atopic Dermatitis (12.79). As such, we are optimistic that we will achieve both coding and coverage for the desired indication. Further, large commercial carriers such as Cigna have recently announced coverage up to $38,000 annually for excimer laser phototherapy for vitiligo, indicating yet another signal in the importance of therapy for this disease. 
 The Company has a high degree of confidence that the RECELL System can be an effective therapeutic offering for patients with stable vitiligo. More than 1,000 patients have been successfully treated with the RECELL System for stable vitiligo outside of the U.S., and to date there are eleven (11) publications demonstrating the benefits of the RECELL System in vitiligo. Vitiligo is a large and untapped market with no FDA-approved treatments. RECELL would be the first point-of-care device for preparation of pigment cell suspension which could offer a single application treatment for patients with stable vitiligo. 
 Epidermolysis Bullosa
 The RECELL System has been studied in a wide variety of indications and has been shown to enable patients to regenerate natural healthy skin in instances where the patient’s outer skin covering, or epidermis, has been lost or damaged. In addition to these applications of the RECELL System, we are pursuing related opportunities where the RECELL System’s ability to harness the natural healing capabilities of the body could be augmented with the use of genetically modified cells for treatment of certain genetic skin disorders. In this way, the RECELL System could potentially be used as a vehicle for other therapeutic offerings. 
 Epidermolysis Bullosa (“EB”) is a rare and incurable group of disorders caused by mutations in genes encoding structural skin proteins. EB is characterized by skin fragility and blistering leading to chronic wounds due to normal mechanical trauma. Dystrophic EB (“DEB”) is often associated with widespread blistering, pain, pruritus, extensive scarring, increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma with increased mortality. Signs typically occur at birth and persist over a lifetime. Currently, there are no FDA-

approved treatments. All treatment options are palliative—focused primarily on pain and nutritional management, itching relief, and wound care (bandaging) with a significant cost burden ranging from $200,000-$500,000 per year per patient. 
 In November 2019, AVITA entered into a research agreement with the Gates Center for Regenerative Medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine (“Gates Center”) for the purpose of seeking to establish pre-clinical proof-of-concept for a spray-on treatment of genetically corrected cells. Pursuant to this agreement, we are pairing the RECELL System Spray-On Skin Cells technology and expertise with the Gates Center’s innovative patent-pending combined reprogramming and gene-editing technology, to allow the skin cells of patients with EB to function properly. Under the arrangement with the Gates Center, we retain the option to exclusively license technologies emerging from the partnership for further development and commercialization. 
 There are several products in development for EB, including other gene therapies, but to our knowledge this will be the first spray-on method explored for the delivery of a gene therapy for a genetic skin disease. We expect the developed technology to be widely applicable, and agnostic to the gene correction approach used. Further, Gates Center’s patented approach is unique in that it is designed to correct the underlying defect in the gene and not just augment with additional copies of genes. It also enables a single step, integration-free reprogramming which enables expansion of corrected cells. Further, many of the products in development are targeted at addressing symptoms of the disease and are not curative, while others will require repeat administration versus a “one and done” approach. Others have faced significant developmental delays. In addition, we believe that spray-on delivery of genetically corrected cells for in situ skin regeneration will have significant benefits over epidermal sheet-based delivery. Without the requirement for cultured sheets, delivery of the therapeutic will be faster and more logistically practical without the challenges associated with production and transportation of fragile, confluent sheets. Moreover, Spray-On Skin Cell delivery to patients is significantly less complex as the treatment area is sprayed and dressed as opposed to suturing on an epidermal graft that does not always “take.”
 DEB is an orphan disease with a prevalence of approximately 6 per million with the majority of individuals not surviving past their 30th birthday.  In the U.S., we estimate there are approximately 900 EB patients eligible for the technology that we have in development and that the price point would be in the range of $850,000, leading to a $750 million addressable market. We also believe there are potential faster regulatory pathways to market by leveraging FDA programs for orphan diseases, and a high probability of reimbursement success and quick adoption given the dire need from patients. 
 This agreement marks an important milestone in AVITA’s strategy to expand the potential of our regenerative medicine platform and is another step towards our mission of improving patients’ lives and addressing unmet needs, including those conditions that are driven by genetic aberrations.  Further, this program could enable diversification beyond EB as the technology has potential applicability to other EB sub-types and over 50 other genetic skin disorders such as epidermolytic icthyosis and Hailey-Hailey disease. We expect to realize proof of concept with its EB-related work with Gates Center by the end of December 2021.   
 Rejuvenation
 We believe that reversing aging at a cellular level has the potential to impact rejuvenation by driving functional changes to skin cells. This will be significantly different from existing products, such as cosmeceuticals that supplement proteins to cells, and surgical approaches that do not alter cellular stat but alter tissue morphology. An approach for molecular reversal of the underlying defects resulting in aging could have a profound effect on rejuvenation.
 In November 2020, AVITA announced a preclinical research agreement with the Houston Methodist Research Institute (“HMRI”) to explore molecular reversal of cellular aging through a novel cell suspension delivery system. AVITA retains the option to exclusively license HMRI’s patented technology as well as the right of first negotiations to HMRI’s technologies emerging from the partnership for further development and commercialization.  AVITA expects to realize proof of concept with its rejuvenation work with HMRI by the end of December 2021.  
 HMRI is a compelling partner for this work. Dr. John Cooke and his team have developed a novel, patented approach of telomerase reverse transcriptase delivery to reverse cellular aging and have been widely recognized as leaders in this space with multiple peer reviewed publications, grants, and awards. Further, HMRI has a strong program in translational medicine, including the Center for Rapid Device Translation that supports preclinical testing and GLP environments which could enable rapid translation from research into clinical trials. 
 American consumers spend over $16 billion on aesthetic procedures per year. 10 million injectable cosmetic procedures were performed in 2019. While these are popular procedures, they do not address skin tone, texture, or tightness. Approximately 350,000 facelift and forehead lift procedures were performed in the same time period. The dramatic differences in procedure volumes are likely due to invasiveness and fear of surgery (including general anesthesia) as well as cost. Consumers are seeking a natural, more youthful appearance and there is a whitespace in the market for a minimally invasive procedure that provides meaningful results.

SALES AND MARKETING
 We sell the RECELL System in the U.S. through our direct commercial organization consisting of 23 field personnel who are supported by corporate marketing, reimbursement, scientific and medical affairs, operations, and corporate leadership. The field sales team was recruited and hired subsequent to the September 2018 FDA PMA and trained prior to the U.S. market launch of RECELL in January 2019. Our field organization is composed of highly experienced medical sales representatives as well as former burn nurses averaging 19 years of sales experience and 10 years of burns experience. We believe that our current field organization is of an appropriate size, without significant additions, to reach the burn surgeons and other key decision makers and staff associated within U.S. burn centers. 
 A primary objective of our field sales team is to build upon burn community awareness that has resulted from an extensive series of RECELL System related burn conference presentations and scientific publications to further expand interest in the clinical and economic benefits of the RECELL System. In addition, our field sales team provides robust clinical case support and staff training. It is not uncommon in the burn community to have rotating staff and it is our commitment for all those working with RECELL to be comfortable with the technology both during the procedure as well as during aftercare.
 HUMAN CAPITAL
 AVITA’s investment in the U.S. commercial success of RECELL has led to the development of best-in-class teams supporting sales, clinical education and training, reimbursement, medical affairs, as well as corporate management and infrastructure. As of June 30, 2021, we had approximately 108 employees full-time and part-time employees. As of June 30, 2021, 97.3% of our workforce was based in the United States, with a significant number of our management and professional employees having prior experience with leading medical product, biotech, or pharmaceutical companies. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. 
 We embrace differences, diversity and varying perspectives amongst our employee base and are proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate based on race, religious creed, color, national origin, ancestry, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, sex, gender, gender identity, gender expression, age, military or veteran status, sexual orientation or any other protected characteristic established by federal, state, or local laws. A diverse workforce as well as an inclusive culture and work environment are fundamentally important and strategic to us beginning with our Board of Directors and CEO and extending to all levels of the Company. As of June 30, 2021, our executive leadership team was 50% female, our senior leadership team was 40% female, and our total employee base was 47% female. In addition to promoting gender diversity, we encourage ethnic diverse talent when recruiting as well as provide employee training and development focusing on workplace diversity and inclusion.
 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 
 We seek to protect our intellectual property, core technologies and other know-how through a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets, non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements, licenses, assignments of invention and other contractual arrangements with our employees, consultants, partners, suppliers, customers, and others. Additionally, we rely on our research and development program, clinical trials, know-how and marketing programs to advance our products and product candidates, and to expand our intellectual property rights.   
 
As of June 30, 2021, we have been granted a total of 56 patents and have 26 pending patent applications worldwide. AVITA owns granted patents in Austria, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, United Kingdom and USA, as well as pending patent applications in Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, and the United States. AVITA’s patent portfolio covers AVITA’s core RECELL System, methods of using the RECELL System, the Regenerative Epidermal Suspension (“RES®”) suspension, methods of evaluating the therapeutic potential of RES, methods of preparing a cell suspension with exogenous agents to promote wound healing, as well as to one or more automated systems for tissue processing and preparation of cell suspension. AVITA’s pending patent applications cover an all-in-one RECELL System embodiment, as well as new modifications to RES that are showing potential for therapeutic results. We expect that our research and development pipeline, strategic partnerships with universities, and improvements to the RECELL System and RES will result in additional and diverse patent applications for both compositions of matter and related methods of use in the next calendar year.
 
In 2019, AVITA filed a Patent Term Extension (“PTE”) application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office requesting an extension of the patent term of U.S. Patent No. 9,029,140, “Cell suspension preparation technique and device” as a result of the time required for the FDA regulatory process. If the term extension requested in the PTE application is approved, the patent term of U.S. Patent No. 9,029,140, which covers the RECELL System, will be extended to April 9, 2024. AVITA’s other patents have expected expiration dates ranging from 2022 to 2040.

Additionally, AVITA owns and defends a global trademark portfolio comprising over 120 registered trademarks and pending trademark applications, including the trademarks “RECELL,” “Spray-On Skin,” the RECELL System logo, “RES,” and others in the U.S. and international markets. In addition to patent and trademark protection, we also rely on trade secrets, know-how, and other proprietary information to develop and maintain our competitive position. We have robust confidentiality and invention disclosure procedures in place that incentivize our employees to innovate and allow us to maintain our rights to AVITA innovations.
 FACILITIES
 AVITA leases approximately 17,500 square feet of administrative and office space in Valencia, CA that is currently leased through July 31, 2022. The Company operates an FDA-registered production plant in Ventura, California, in a 27,480 square foot facility that is currently leased through September 30, 2024. We have two 3-year options to extend the lease, at our sole option, which allows for a total lease extension period through September 30, 2030. We also lease a limited amount of incubator space in Irvine, CA for scientific research and product development activities. 
MANUFACTURING, SUPPLY AND PRODUCTION
We produce the RECELL System in the Ventura facility under current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) and per ISO 13485, which also meets the regulatory requirements of other jurisdictions in which we sell the RECELL System. We maintain a state of regulatory compliance and inspection readiness at all times, and any future material changes to our production processes for the RECELL System will be submitted for approval to the FDA and regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions as required. 
 Within the Ventura facility we perform the final manufacturing, assembly, packaging, and warehousing of the RECELL System. Also included within the Ventura facility is a secure controlled-temperature warehouse that complies with the vendor-managed inventory (“VMI”) requirements of the contract with Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (“BARDA”). See below for details.
 AVITA sources multiple components, sub-assemblies, and materials from third-party suppliers, who are required to meet our cGMP quality specifications and associated regulatory requirements. To ensure continuity of supply, we maintain multiple sources of supply for key components, subassemblies and materials, and the majority of critical raw materials and services have multiple qualified suppliers. While a small number of materials remain single sourced, we are actively working to qualify and validate additional suppliers for these materials as we continue to evaluate methods of removing risk from the supply chain for the RECELL System. We believe that our current manufacturing capacity at the Ventura facility is sufficient to meet the expected commercial demand for the RECELL System for burns, as well as other indications under development, for the foreseeable future. 
 AVITA serves the U.S. burn market by shipping the RECELL System directly from our Ventura facility to U.S. burn centers. From time-to-time we also store small quantities of the RECELL System at satellite distribution sites within the U.S. to better support access of the RECELL System to our U.S. customers.
 BARDA CONTRACT 
 We have a contract with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (“BARDA”), under the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, valued at approximately $53.4 million. The contract provided funding for the development of the RECELL System.  The contract will continue to provide funding for future use of the product as a medical countermeasure to assist disaster preparedness and response in the U.S. for mass casualty events involving burn injuries. We entered into the contract on September 29, 2015, and the scope has expanded through a number of amendments to the contract. The contract may be terminated earlier at the option of BARDA, but otherwise continues to December 31, 2023. 
 Under the contract, BARDA has provided funding and technical support for the development of the RECELL System. BARDA funded the completion of two randomized, controlled pivotal clinical trials, as well as Compassionate Use and Continued Access programs, and development of the health economic model demonstrating the cost savings associated with the RECELL System. BARDA exercised a contract option to fund a randomized, controlled clinical trial for a pediatric early intervention study which commenced enrollment in March 2020, and closed to enrollment in June 2021, subsequent to FDA-approval of an expanded RECELL indication for use that includes treatment of pediatric patients. Also included in the BARDA contract was a provision for procurement of the RECELL System under a vendor-managed inventory system to bolster emergency preparedness in the amount of $7.6 million. Further, BARDA expanded the awarded contract to provide supplemental funding of $1.6 million to support the logistics of emergency deployment of RECELL Systems for use in mass casualty or other emergency situations. Delivery of RECELL Systems 
 11


under the VMI plan was completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021. As of June 30, 2021, we had received cumulative payments of $30.9 million under the BARDA contract.
 COMPETITION
 The medical device, biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive and subject to significant technological change and changes in practice. While we believe that our innovative technology, knowledge, experience, and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we may face competition from many different sources with respect to the RECELL System or any product candidates that we may seek to develop and commercialize in the future. Possible competitors may include medical device, pharmaceutical and wound care companies, academic and medical institutions, governmental agencies, medical practitioners, and public and private research institutions, among others. Any product that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with both existing therapies and any new therapies that may become available in the future. 
 Our primary competitor in the burns market is the current standard of care, primarily split-thickness autografts. Although the RECELL System is complementary with autografts for the treatment of many burn injuries, we face competition from this traditional surgical procedure for many burn patients. However, based on our clinical trials, we believe that the RECELL System has sustainable competitive clinical and economic advantages over this current standard of care. We face additional competition in the burns market from other FDA-approved products such as Epicel® provided by Vericel Corporation as well as from Stratagraft® provided by Mallinckrodt.
 
GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS 
 FDA and International Regulation 
 The production and marketing of the RECELL System and any additional product candidates developed in future ongoing research and development activities are subject to regulation by numerous governmental authorities including the FDA in the U.S. and similar agencies in other countries throughout the world.  Pursuant to its authority under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), the FDA has jurisdiction over medical devices in the U.S. The FDA regulates the design, development, manufacturing, and distribution of medical devices to ensure that medical products distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses. The FD&C Act classifies medical devices into one of three categories based on the risks associated with the device and the level of control necessary to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously 510(k) cleared device are categorized as Class III. These devices typically require submission and approval of a PMA. The RECELL System is categorized as a Class III medical device, and in September 2018 the FDA granted our PMA for use in the treatment of acute thermal burns in patients 18 years and older. In June 2021, the FDA approved a supplement to our PMA to expand the use of RECELL in pediatric patients with full-thickness burns. Approval of the RECELL System for use in the treatment of new indications in the U.S. will require additional PMA supplement submissions to the FDA following successful completion of clinical studies. 
 To support PMA supplements in the U.S. or applications for approval in other regions, the completion of additional clinical and non-clinical studies and supporting development activities will likely be required. Clinical trials can take many years to complete and require the expenditure of substantial resources. The length of time varies substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use of the product candidate. We cannot make any assurances that once clinical trials are completed by us or a collaborative partner, that we will be able to submit as scheduled a marketing approval request to the applicable governmental regulatory authority, or that such request and application will be reviewed and cleared by such governmental authority in a timely manner, or at all. Although we intend to make use of fast-track and abbreviated regulatory approval programs when possible and commercially appropriate, we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain the clearances and approvals necessary for clinical testing or for manufacturing and marketing our product candidates. Delays in obtaining regulatory approvals could adversely affect the development and commercialization of our product candidates and could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. During the course of clinical trials and non-clinical studies, product candidates may exhibit unforeseen and unacceptable safety considerations. If any unacceptable side effects were to occur, we may, or regulatory authorities may require us to, interrupt, limit, delay or abort the development of our potential products. 
 Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to regulatory approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA and similar agencies in other countries, including maintaining records supporting manufacturing and distribution under Current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) regulations, periodic reporting, advertising, promotion, compliance with any post-approval requirements imposed as a conditional of approval, recordkeeping and reporting requirements, including adverse events experiences. After approval, material changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, or changes to the manufacturing process, are subject to prior approval by FDA and other regulatory agencies. Medical device manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA, certain state agencies and international agencies. 
 12


Subcontractors are subject to periodic announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA and other agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. We have established processes in place for categorization of vendor criticality and the associated activities for qualification and monitoring of vendors. These activities include but are not limited to, requiring certification of supplier in conformance to relevant cGMP regulations and other FDA and international agency regulatory requirements, approved supplier lists, and regular Company conducted audits. In addition, all goods and services purchased from suppliers by us must be purchased from only those suppliers on the approved supplier list. Furthermore, the Company itself will continue to comply with all relevant FDA requirements and regulations and any applicable international agency regulatory requirements in its continued manufacturing and promotion of its FDA approved commercial product. 
 
In addition to FDA approval in the U.S., the RECELL System is TGA-registered in Australia for use in the treatment of burns, acute wounds, scars, and vitiligo. In the European Union, the RECELL System has received CE-mark approval for the treatment of burns, chronic wounds, scars, and vitiligo. In February 2019, our marketing partner COSMOTEC filed a Japan’s Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Act (“JPMDA”) application for approval to market the RECELL System in Japan for the treatment of burns and other wounds. The JPMDA has accepted the application and the review is ongoing with approval expected to occur during 2021.

--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Additionally, certain state laws require medical device companies to comply with voluntary compliance guidelines promulgated by global trade associations and relevant compliance guidance issues by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General. Such laws prohibit medical device manufacturers from offering or providing certain types of payments or gifts to health care providers; and/or require the disclosure of gifts or payments to healthcare providers.
 
Interactions with Foreign Officials and Entities
 
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party, or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the U.S. to comply with accounting provisions requiring the companies to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the companies, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. We are also subject to similar regulations under the Australian bribery laws and other anti-corruption laws that apply in countries where we do business.

Federal and State Reporting
 
Pursuant to the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, AVITA is required to report annually to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, as well as in accordance with all relevant state marketing reporting regulations, any payments, and transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as other categories of disclosures. 
Privacy
 AVITA must comply with the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) which imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other conduct, making false statements relating to healthcare matters and executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program.  It also imposes criminal and civil liability and penalties on those who violate requirements such as mandatory contractual terms which are intended to safeguard the security, transmission and use of individually identifiable health information. 
 
Various state and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information such as the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). GDPR governs the use of individual health data and other personal information and imposes strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to use, access, process, and disseminate health data from clinical trials and adverse event reporting, among others.
 
ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY MATTERS
 We are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in a number of jurisdictions, primarily in California and the U.S., governing, among other things: the use, storage, registration, handling, emission and disposal of chemicals, waste materials and sewage; chemicals, air, water and ground contamination; and air emissions and the cleanup of contaminated sites, including any contamination that could result from spills due to our failure to properly dispose of production waste materials. Our operations at our Ventura manufacturing facility produce a small amount of waste materials that are considered minimally hazardous, and we use a third-party waste disposal company to remove any waste generated during operations from the facility. Our activities require permits from various governmental authorities including local municipal authorities. Local and state authorities may conduct periodic inspections in order to review and ensure our compliance with the various regulations. We are not presently aware of any violations or deficiencies. These laws, regulations and permits could potentially require the expenditure by us for compliance or remediation.
