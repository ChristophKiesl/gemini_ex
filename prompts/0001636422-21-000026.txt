Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a leading provider of data and analytics technology and services to healthcare organizations. Our Solution comprises a cloud-based data platform, analytics software, and professional services expertise. Our customers, which are primarily healthcare providers, use our Solution to manage their data, derive analytical insights to operate their organizations, and produce measurable clinical, financial, and operational improvements. We envision a future where all healthcare decisions are data informed.
The Health Catalyst Way
Our Mission
Our mission is to be the catalyst for massive, measurable, data-informed healthcare improvement. We fulfill our mission through a confluence of the following elements:
•Data Platform: integrate data in a flexible, open, and scalable platform to power healthcare’s digital transformation;
•Analytics Applications: deliver insights on how to measurably improve through the use of analytics applications;
•Services Expertise: enable data-informed improvement by providing analytical, clinical, financial, and operational experts; and
•Engagement: attract, develop, and retain world-class team members by being a best place to work.
The Health Catalyst Flywheel
We accomplish our mission with each of our customers by following a process we call the Health Catalyst Flywheel or the Flywheel. This process includes delivering on the three components of our Solution: data platform, analytics applications, and services expertise, which together drive measurable improvements. At the center of the Flywheel is the engagement of our team members. Team member engagement is foundational to everything we do and is the #1 priority of our CEO and broader leadership team. When team members feel connected to our mission and are listened to, cared for, and respected at an extraordinary level, they produce outstanding work, which enables our customers to measurably improve. As customers realize improvements, their trust in Health Catalyst builds, their engagement in our shared work increases, and they choose to renew and expand their relationship with us, while also referring Health Catalyst to key decision-makers at other potential customers. Customer renewal, expansion, and referral produce growing, scalable, and predictable financial performance.
The virtuous cycle described above creates momentum for our business and is encapsulated in the following diagram:
Given the central importance of team member engagement to our company’s long-term success, we have been purposeful in defining and emphasizing operating principles and cultural attributes that reinforce the commitment to our mission and to team member engagement. We consistently focus on our operating principles and cultural attributes, as well as our mission and Flywheel (collectively, the Health Catalyst Way), which we review in all new hire orientations, company-wide meetings, and board of directors’ meetings. Furthermore, we regularly measure our team member engagement and adjust our practices based on team member feedback. We have demonstrated an elite, consistent level of team member engagement over time as demonstrated by a 95th to 99th percentile ranking by Gallup.
We will continue to emphasize the Health Catalyst Way, including our operating principles and cultural attributes, which we believe will be central to our long-term success.

Business Overview
Healthcare organizations operate in an environment that is characterized by waste, changing economics, and data complexity. Organizations that leverage analytics to make data-informed decisions will be better positioned to succeed in this environment. Our customers, which are primarily healthcare providers, use our Solution to manage their data, derive analytical insights to operate their organizations, and produce measurable clinical, financial, and operational improvements.
The core elements of our Solution include:
•Data platform. The Data Operating System (DOS) is a healthcare-specific, cloud-based, open, flexible, and scalable data platform that provides customers a single comprehensive environment to integrate and organize data from their disparate software systems. Our data platform has been built with modern technology and is deeply embedded with healthcare domain knowledge, enabling a broad range of analytics. DOS has amassed one of the largest and most comprehensive data assets of its kind, which enables us to deliver differentiated insights to our customers.
•Analytics applications. Our analytics applications build on top of our data platform and are designed to analyze the most common problems our customers face. These analytics applications allow our customers to pinpoint opportunities for measurable improvement across their entire enterprise and are employed by a broad range of users from healthcare executives to front-line clinicians providing care. We developed this suite of foundational and domain-specific software analytics applications over the last few years based on thoughtful measurement of the most critical analytics needs faced by our customers. Our software analytics applications are further enhanced by a broad range of analytics accelerators, which are pre-built, configurable data models with customizable visualizations that can be tailored to specific customer needs.
•Services expertise. Our world-class team consists of both analytics experts, such as data analysts, data engineers, and data scientists, and domain experts, such as healthcare administrators, physicians, and nurses. Our services are comprised of data & analytics services, domain expertise services, outsourcing services, and implementation services. Our services team members leverage our technology to help our customers shorten time-to-value and achieve sustainable measurable improvements. Examples of the services expertise we provide include opportunity analysis and prioritization, data governance, data modeling and analysis, quality and process improvement strategy, cost accounting, data abstraction, and population health strategies. Our approach to integrate data, analytics, and expertise into a holistic Solution is differentiated and has been recognized as among the best in the industry by multiple third parties, including KLAS, Chilmark Research, and Black Book. 
We have generated over a thousand documented, customer-verified improvements across clinical, financial, and operational domains. In addition to the positive ROI of customers utilizing our Solution versus a costly homegrown solution, each of these documented improvements is highly valuable to our customers, enabling them to realize substantial clinical improvements, financial savings, or operational efficiencies. As we deliver measurable improvements, trust builds, and our customers engage with us more broadly and refer new business. This is evidenced by a continued increase in improvements achieved by our customers over time. Customers who have recently contracted with us have already started achieving measurable improvements, while longer-standing customers have seen the number of annual improvements meaningfully grow.
We serve the majority of our customers through a subscription-based contract model. As of December 31, 2020, we served 74 customers with a DOS subscription contract and over 300 other customers. The majority of our customers who are not on a DOS subscription contract are technology customers resulting from our historical acquisitions. Our customers include academic medical centers, integrated delivery networks, community hospitals, large physician practices, ACOs, health information exchanges, health insurers, and other risk-bearing entities. Example customers include Acuitas Health, Allina Health, AlohaCare, Children's Hospital of Orange County, Community Health Network, Mass General Brigham, Northwell Health, Steward Health Care, UnityPoint Health, and UPMC.
We currently employ more than 1,000 team members including over 340 analytics experts and over 75 domain experts. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, our total revenue was $188.8 million, $154.9 million, and $112.6 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, we incurred net losses of $115.0 million, $60.1 million, and $62.0 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, our Adjusted EBITDA was $(21.3) million, $(27.4) million, and $(38.1) million, respectively. See “Selected Consolidated Financial and Other Data - Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for more information about Adjusted EBITDA, including the limitations of such measure and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with GAAP.
Our Strengths
Our operational and financial success is based on the following key strengths:
Healthcare-specific, flexible, open, and scalable data platform. DOS was purpose-built to handle healthcare-specific data management and analytics use cases, including the ingestion of disparate healthcare data sources. By linking healthcare-specific vocabularies and rules with a flexible and adaptable framework, we enable faster and more repeatable analytics. As an open and self-service platform, we support the development of analytics and applications on top of DOS, which accelerates the adoption and integration of our platform by our customers. The majority of analytics that are run on top of DOS are client-generated as opposed to outputs of our applications. The scalable, cloud-based infrastructure enables quicker product iteration and deployment.
Integrated and comprehensive nature of our Solution creates measurable improvements. Through the delivery of our comprehensive and integrated Solution of data, analytics, and services expertise, we enable measurable improvements for our customers. Our Solution has generated over a thousand documented, customer-verified improvements across clinical, financial, and operational domains. 
Attractive operating model. We have an attractive operating model due to the recurring nature of our revenue and the scalability of our data platform and analytics applications. Our recurring revenue subscription model provides a high degree of revenue visibility. The open and flexible nature of DOS makes it highly scalable, which allows us to deliver additional applications on top of DOS with limited incremental costs. We expect the benefits of our operating model and cost structure to generate operating leverage in our business.
Unique and differentiated culture focused on team member engagement. Our leadership team’s commitment to the team member is central to our long-term success. Our commitment to building and maintaining a culture where team members are highly engaged in our mission directly benefits not only team members, but also customers and other stakeholders.
The team member experience is the #1 priority of our CEO and other members of our leadership team. On a daily basis, our leadership focuses on the team member experience, by listening carefully to team member feedback and making changes based on this feedback, by erring in favor of the team member, and by working as an advocate for each team member. This focus enables team members to become highly engaged in fulfilling our mission to be the catalyst for massive, measurable, data-informed improvement in healthcare.
This deep team member engagement in our mission leads team members to build world-class data and analytics technology and to provide industry-leading expertise. The care that the leadership team shows to team members becomes the same care that team members show to our customers, and through this care and commitment, our customers experience accelerating and measurable improvement, which leads them to renew, expand, and refer. By focusing on the team member experience, our customers realize greater improvements, which leads to a high-growth, predictable business model.
Recognized industry leader by multiple third parties. The strength of our Solution has been recognized by multiple third-parties as among the best in the industry. These include KLAS Overall Customer Satisfaction Scores that are frequently among the highest in the peer group, as well as Chilmark Research and Black Book. We recognized early on that healthcare organizations need purpose-built technology products and services to support data-driven insights, and have spent more than a decade building and commercializing our healthcare-specific Solution. We invested meaningful time and resources over the last decade to build a comprehensive and differentiated set of products and services for our customers, which is not easily replicated by other healthcare and/or technology companies. Our customers benefit from our technology innovation and expertise which allows them to avoid the significant time, financial resources, and technical proficiency they would need to invest to build related capabilities in-house. Similarly, the overall complexity and dynamic nature of healthcare require purpose-built products and services to address the challenges our customers face, preventing traditional technology companies from easily leveraging and deploying existing platforms.
Tenured management team with healthcare technology experience. Health Catalyst is led by a team of healthcare and data veterans with many years of combined experience leading digital transformation at health systems, such as Intermountain Healthcare. Our founders and executives collaborated for nearly a decade to pioneer and develop a new data warehousing architecture that resolves many of the problems encountered using traditional data warehousing methodologies. The unique combination of talent and experience across healthcare and technology, as well as our management team’s commitment to the Health Catalyst Way, underpin everything we do.
Our Growth Strategies
Our growth strategies reflect our mission to be the catalyst for massive, measurable, data-informed healthcare improvement. Our focus on multiple channels, as well as our collaborative company culture, results in high levels of sustainable growth. Our strategic levers to drive growth include:
•Grow our overall customer base. We have a substantial opportunity to continue growing our customer base through our active sales and marketing strategy and significant word-of-mouth references. We currently estimate our total core addressable market to include more than 1,200 healthcare organizations, including health systems and risk-bearing entities. We believe there is ample room to win new business and deepen market penetration in our core market. Further, healthcare providers outside of the United States face similar challenges to those in the United States and can implement our Solution to address them. We plan to opportunistically pursue international markets by expanding our business in the United Kingdom, Canada, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East.
•Expand within our current customer base. We intend to deepen and expand the relationships we have with our existing customer base. Our relationship with a new customer oftentimes starts through the use of targeted analytics applications and services to pinpoint and achieve a single measurable clinical, financial, or operational improvement. As we deliver measurable improvements, trust builds, and our customers engage with us more broadly and purchase additional applications and services. We have achieved continued DOS Subscription customer growth in part due to strong customer retention and customer referrals. This is evidenced by our positive Dollar-based Retention Rates of 102%, 109%, and 107% for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. We will continue to invest in helping customers identify additional uses for our Solution, ensuring they achieve measurable improvements throughout our relationship with them.
•Add new analytics applications and services offerings. The expansion of our Solution and enhancement of our applications library will accelerate as we deepen our customer relationships and add to our dataset. Because our platform is open and we partner with our customers, we are able to identify new opportunities for further improvements and leverage that insight with other customers across our core market to develop new analytics applications and services offerings. We have used this process to build eight new software applications over the past few years, and we will continue to invest in product development, particularly at the analytics applications layer of our technology stack.
•Grow our addressable market through additional healthcare business segment adjacencies. We believe there are significant applications for our Solution outside of our core market, as evidenced by our recent expansion into the life sciences market and certain international markets. Other business segment adjacencies include serving the employer space and additional types of providers and risk-bearing entities. While we believe there are significant opportunities in our core market, these business segment agencies have the potential to significantly grow our addressable market and business over time.
•Selectively pursue acquisitions and partnerships. We plan to continue evaluating and identifying opportunities where we can leverage our platform to scale and consolidate both data assets and best-of-breed applications. We believe that competing point solutions vendors will have difficulty in growing their offerings into sustainable businesses, which we believe translates into a robust mergers and acquisitions pipeline for us. We have a track record of identifying and integrating new and complementary capabilities, including our acquisitions of Healthcare Data Works, Medicity, Able Health, Healthfinch, and Vitalware. Moreover, we believe the companies we partner with and acquire choose us because of our collaborative, best-in-class culture which we view as a differentiating factor in sourcing acquisitions and partnerships.
Our Solution
Our Solution empowers our customers to run a data-informed business. Our healthcare-specific, open, flexible, and scalable data platform, advanced analytics applications, and services expertise guide our customers to greater levels of digital maturity, enabling clinical, financial, and operational improvements. The diagram below illustrates the three layers of our comprehensive Solution.
Data Platform - the Data Operating System (DOS)
DOS is a healthcare-specific, open, flexible, and scalable data platform that allows customers to integrate and organize their disparate data sources to enable analytics. It serves as a digital backbone, allowing customers to easily extract data from transactional source systems, combine disparate data sets into a unified source of truth and query the dataset directly. DOS is a cloud-based technology that we primarily provide through Microsoft Azure and through our private data center. In order to enable more advanced feature development and functionality, we are in the process of migrating our customers hosted in our private data center, and a few remaining on-premise customers, to Microsoft Azure.
DOS was uniquely designed and purpose-built to handle the complex, ever-evolving nature of healthcare-specific data. This includes healthcare-specific terminology, data governance, and meta-data management. By creating healthcare-specific data models to organize industry-specific data, we enable faster and more repeatable analytics and insights. We have developed the capabilities to turn these insights into actions by connecting our analytics into the workflow systems, such as an electronic health record (EHR or EMR).
Differentiating attributes of our DOS include:
•Data warehouse. We believe our innovative late-binding architecture has a proven track record of agility and adaptability to new rules, vocabularies, and data content. Our open and self-service platform enables database-level querying and custom analytics use-cases.
•Source connectors. Our platform is designed to quickly ingest data from the numerous information systems and siloed data sources our customers possess. We have prebuilt connectors to the most common transactional software systems used by healthcare organizations. The DOS data management console enables customers to manage robust ETL processes and scheduling.
•Cloud-based. Modern cloud-based architecture is secure and scalable. Being cloud-based enables quicker product iteration and innovation.
•Reusable data logic. Registries, value sets, and other data logic sit on top of the raw data and can be accessed, reused, and updated through open APIs, enabling customer and third-party application development. We update hundreds of registries, value sets, and measure logic regularly. This reusable, healthcare data content enables customers to achieve analytic value more quickly than leveraging homegrown or cross-industry products and services.
•Machine learning. Embedded within DOS are machine learning algorithms that our customers can easily leverage for predictive analytics. Customers can also build their own machine learning data pipelines within DOS.
•Terminology services. By standardizing the complex language used to code entries in various health records and clinical systems, DOS facilitates decision support, consistent reporting, and analytics and interoperability.
•Closed-loop EMR integration. Bridges the gap between insight and action by reducing data lag, interjecting knowledge at the point of decision-making, including back into the workflow of source systems, such as an EMR.
•Text processing. Enables the extraction of additional data currently trapped in various unstructured text blocks. The ability to gather insight from clinical notes remains an area of untapped healthcare intelligence with tremendous potential.
•Real-time streaming and interoperability. Near or real-time data streaming from the source all the way to the expression of that data through DOS, supporting both transaction-level exchange of data and analytic processing.
•Big data. Ability to access, organize, and analyze massive and unique, structured and unstructured, data sets allows us to drive differentiated analytic insights for our customers.
Analytics Applications
We have thoughtfully developed several scalable analytics applications that allow us to deliver the right data to the right place at the right time. Combining this pioneering technique with our data asset of more than one hundred million patient records, our customers systematically uncover opportunities for actionable interventions. We have organized our analytics applications into two categories: foundational software applications and domain-specific software applications. In addition, we have created a suite of analytics accelerators, which provide customers with a starting point to leverage for tailored insights.
Foundational Software Applications
•Registry and Measures Authoring (Population Builder). Enables non-SQL writers like clinicians and administrators to dynamically author, manage, view, and publish pre-built and custom population ruleset definitions using an elegant drag-and-drop interface. Rulesets can be published as a registry, leveraged across the DOS analytics platform and augmented with summary metrics using our tools. These registries can be used for internal quality improvement and research efforts or for reporting to external organizational registries.
•Benchmarking (Touchstone). Uses artificial intelligence to proactively identify where a customer is performing relative to benchmark sets composed of proprietary and publicly-available data; subsequently recommends and prioritizes opportunities for improvement.
•Dashboards and Reporting (Leading Wisely). Enables users to quickly and easily add clinical, financial, and operational measures in an executive dashboard format. Measures are trended over time and updated on a near real-time basis from DOS. Users can customize information, share it with others, and set their own alerts and notifications. As a result, executives and their teams are empowered to take control of the data deluge to plan, prioritize improvement projects, create alignment among groups, strategize the best products and services, and communicate decisions more effectively.
Domain-Specific Software Applications
•Activity-Based Costing (CORUS).  Activity-based costing software application that leverages clinical and operational data from DOS to calculate a true cost of clinical processes and patients on the most granular level. Enables CFOs, physicians, service line leaders, and clinical and financial analysts to understand the true cost of providing care and relate those costs to patient outcomes.
•Patient Safety (Patient Safety Monitor). Trigger-based surveillance system enabled by DOS. This application monitors patient-level data and applies machine learning algorithms to predict whether a patient is currently at risk for a safety event so that the patient's clinicians can intervene as they deem necessary to prevent harm events.
•Care Management. Patient-centric population health service that utilizes data integration, patient stratification and intake, care coordination, patient engagement, and performance measurement to optimize care delivery for high-risk patients.
•Population Health Foundations. Product suite designed to help health systems manage risk-based contracts and bundled payment models and allow providers to tailor patient care based upon population metrics and benchmarks.
•Quality and Regulatory Measures. Foundational product for integrating hundreds of measures across financial, regulatory, and quality departments and reporting those measures to third-party entities like CMS. Enables proactive measures surveillance to enhance outcomes and facilitates monitoring behaviors, interventions, and activities needed to influence, manage, or change outcomes.
•EMR Embedded Insights (Care Gap Closure): Cloud-based product suite that provides a workflow integration engine delivering insights and analytics into EMR workflows to automate physicians’ ability to close patient care gaps in real-time.
•Revenue Improvement and Workflow Optimization: Revenue workflow optimization and analytics SaaS technology solution portfolio, including products related to chargemaster management, price transparency and revenue integrity. 
Analytics Accelerators
•To further enhance our analytics applications we have also developed a library of tailored analytics accelerators. Analytics accelerators are pre-built data models and customizable visualizations that leverage the broad set of integrated data stored within our DOS platform for a specific analytic use-case. Customers who utilize our analytics accelerators achieve a much faster time-to-value compared to building an analytic model from the ground up. Our customers frequently rely on our analytics expertise to customize our analytics accelerators, as well as our domain expertise in order to successfully leverage our analytics accelerators to drive data-informed improvement. The breadth of our analytics accelerators facilitates analytic insights across clinical, financial, and operational use-cases. Our suite of more than 40 analytics accelerators provides highly-specific clinical, financial, and operational insights. Examples of these accelerators include:

•regulatory compliance verification and functionality;
•domain expertise with respect to healthcare; and
•ability to integrate with legacy enterprise infrastructures and third-party applications.
We believe that we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors. However, many of our competitors and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technological, and other resources and name recognition than we do and more established distribution networks and relationships with healthcare providers. As a result, many of these companies may respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and standards and changes in customer requirements. These companies may be able to invest more resources in research and development, strategic acquisitions, sales and marketing, patent prosecution, litigation, and financing capital equipment acquisitions for their customers.
Government Regulation
Our business is subject to extensive, complex, and rapidly changing federal and state laws and regulations. Various federal and state agencies have discretion to issue regulations and interpret and enforce healthcare laws. While we believe we comply in all material respects with applicable healthcare laws and regulations, these regulations can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and interpretation of existing laws and regulations may change periodically. Federal and state legislatures also may enact various legislative proposals that could materially impact certain aspects of our business. The following are summaries of key federal and state laws and regulations that impact our operations:
Government Regulation of Health-Related and Other Personal Information
In the United States, numerous state and federal laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information privacy laws, and consumer protection laws and regulations, govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information could apply to our operations or the operations of our customers. 
For example, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, and regulations implemented thereunder (collectively, HIPAA) impose obligations on “covered entities,” including certain health care providers, health plans, and health care clearinghouses, and their respective “business associates” that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information (PHI) for or on behalf of such covered entities, as well as their covered subcontractors with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of PHI. 
Since we provide services that require us to use and disclose PHI on behalf of our covered entity customers, we are a business associate. Our covered entity customers are required under HIPAA to enter into business associate agreements (BAAs) with us and we are required to enter into BAAs with our downstream subcontractors that access or otherwise process PHI on our behalf. As a business associate, we are required to comply with the HIPAA security standards, and certain provisions of the HIPAA privacy standards and breach notification rule, and may be subject to significant civil and criminal penalties for failure to do so. 
In addition to HIPAA, most states have enacted patient confidentiality laws that protect against the disclosure of confidential medical information, including privacy safeguards, and security standards. Many states have also adopted data security breach notification requirements. Such state laws, if more stringent than HIPAA requirements, are not preempted by the federal requirements, and we must comply with them. In addition, certain states have adopted other laws governing the use and disclosure of personal information. For example, California recently enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which went into effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA, among other things, creates new data privacy obligations for covered companies and provides new privacy rights to California residents, including the right to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA also creates a private right of action with statutory damages for certain data breaches, thereby potentially increasing risks associated with a data breach. Further, the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) was recently voted into law by California residents. The CPRA significantly amends the CCPA, and imposes additional data protection obligations on covered companies doing business in California, including additional consumer rights processes and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data. It also creates a new California data protection agency specifically tasked to enforce the law, which would likely result in increased regulatory scrutiny of California businesses in the areas of data protection and security. The substantive requirements for businesses subject to the CPRA will go into effect on January 1, 2023, and become enforceable on July 1, 2023.
Federal and state consumer protection laws are being applied increasingly by the FTC, Federal Communications Commission and states’ attorneys general to regulate the collection, use, storage and disclosure of personal or patient information, through websites or otherwise, and to regulate the presentation of website content and to regulate direct marketing, including telemarketing and telephonic communication. Courts may also adopt the standards for fair information practices promulgated by the FTC, which concern consumer notice, choice, security, and access.
Fraud, Waste, and Abuse
Even though we do not directly order or provide healthcare services that are reimbursable by Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors or submit claims or receive reimbursement from any such payor, certain federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud, abuse and waste apply or may apply to our business and to the financial arrangements through which we market, sell and provide our services to our healthcare provider customers. These laws and regulations include or may include the following:
•The federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, in exchange for, or intended to induce or reward, including arranging for or recommending, either the referral of an individual, or the purchase, lease, order, prescription, or recommendation of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid program. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation.
•The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, such as the federal False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws impose criminal and civil penalties and authorizes civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for, among other things: knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to a federal government healthcare program, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent; making, using or causing to be made or used, a false statement or record material to payment of a false or fraudulent claim or obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the federal government; or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. The government may deem entities to have “caused” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to our customers. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act. Moreover, private individuals have the ability to bring actions on behalf of the U.S. government under the federal False Claims Act as well as under the false claims laws of several states.
•HIPAA also contains a provision that imposes criminal and civil liability for knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program (including private payors) or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private) and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items, or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Similarly, the federal false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services.
In addition, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes and regulations that apply regardless of the payor, including commercial payors and self-pay patients. Violations of federal and state fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including significant penalties, fines, disgorgement, additional reporting requirements and oversight under a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of noncompliance with these laws, imprisonment and/or exclusion or suspension from federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, and debarment from contracting with the U.S. government. 
Corporate Practice of Medicine and Fee-Splitting Laws
In many states, there are laws that that prohibit business entities, such as us, from providing professional medical services or directly employing or otherwise exercising control over professional judgment or medical decisions by physicians or other licensed health care professionals (such activities generally referred to as the “corporate practice of medicine”). Corporate practice of medicine regulations and other similar laws may also prevent fee-splitting, or the sharing of professional service income with non-professional or business interests. Overseeing a care coordination or care management team could be alleged in some cases to involve treatment or diagnosis of patients which requires a clinic license or other state license or permission. Any determination that we are acting in the capacity of a healthcare provider and acting improperly as a healthcare provider, exercising undue influence or control over a healthcare provider or impermissibly sharing fees with a healthcare provider, may result in additional compliance requirements, expense, and liability to us, and require us to change or terminate some portions of our contractual arrangements or business.
Patient Safety Organization Certification and Other Certification Requirements
Our patient safety organization (PSO) is certified by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), an agency of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). We must meet certain requirements to maintain this certification. In addition, there may be other federal and state certification requirements that we may be required to meet from time to time in connection with our Solution. We cannot be certain that our Solution will continue to meet these standards. The failure to comply with these certification requirements could result in the loss of certification.
Interoperability Standards. ONC is charged under the 21st Century Cures Act with developing a Trusted Exchange Framework that establishes governance requirements for trusted health information exchange in the United States. ONC has developed the U.S. Common Data Set for Interoperability which may lay the groundwork for future data exchange requirements for trusted exchange. ONC continues to modify and refine these standards. We may incur increased software development and administrative expense and delays in delivering technology and services if we need to update our services to conform to these varying and evolving requirements. In addition, delays in interpreting these standards may result in postponement or cancellation of our clients’ decisions to purchase our services. If our services are not compliant with these evolving standards, our market position and sales could be impaired, and we may have to invest significantly in changes to our technology and services.
The 21st Century Cures Act includes provisions related to data interoperability, information blocking, and patient access. CMS and the ONC recently issued final rules related to these provisions, which include, among other things, requirements surrounding information blocking, changes to ONC's Health IT Certification Program and requirements that CMS-regulated payors make relevant claims/care data and provider directory information available through standardized patient access and provider directory application programming interfaces (APIs) that connect to provider electronic health records. Any failure to adequately comply with these rules may adversely impact our business and our ability to compete.
In a regulatory climate that is uncertain, our operations may be subject to direct and indirect adoption, expansion or reinterpretation of various federal and state laws and regulations. Compliance with these amended and/or future laws and regulations may require us to change our practices at an undeterminable and possibly significant initial monetary and annual expense. There could be laws and regulations applicable to our business that we have not identified or that, if changed, may apply to our business operations. Additionally, the introduction of new services may require us to comply with additional, yet undetermined, laws and regulations.
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
The FDA regulates medical or health-related software, including machine learning functionality and predictive algorithms, if such software falls within the definition of a “medical device” under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA). Medical devices are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA and by other federal, state and local authorities. The FDCA and related regulations govern the conditions of safety, efficacy, clearance, approval, manufacturing, quality system requirements, labeling, packaging, distribution, storage, recordkeeping, reporting, marketing, advertising, and promotion of medical devices. However, historically, the FDA has exercised enforcement discretion for certain low-risk software, and has issued several guidance documents outlining its approach to the regulation of software as a medical device. In addition, the 21st Century Cures Act includes exemptions for certain medical-related software, including software used for administrative support functions at a healthcare facility, software intended for maintaining or encouraging a healthy lifestyle, software designed to store electronic health records, software for transferring, storing, or displaying medical device data or in vitro diagnostic data, and certain clinical decision support software. Accordingly, we believe our currently marketed products are not currently regulated by the FDA as medical devices, or are otherwise subject to FDA’s current enforcement discretion policies.
FDA Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements - Unless an exemption applies, each medical device commercially distributed in the United States requires either FDA clearance of a 510(k) premarket notification, or approval of a premarket approval application (PMA). Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of manufacturer and regulatory control needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness. Class I includes devices with the lowest risk to the patient and are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the FDA’s General Controls for medical devices, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the Quality System Regulation (QSR), facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Class II devices are subject to the FDA’s General Controls, and special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. These special controls can include performance standards, postmarket surveillance, patient registries and FDA guidance documents. 
While most Class I devices are exempt from the 510(k) premarket notification requirement, manufacturers of most Class II devices are required to submit to the FDA a premarket notification under Section 510(k) of the FDCA requesting permission to commercially distribute the device. The FDA’s permission to commercially distribute a device subject to a 510(k) premarket notification is generally known as 510(k) clearance. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or some implantable devices, or devices that have a new intended use, or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device, are placed in Class III, requiring approval of a PMA. Some pre-amendment devices are unclassified, but are subject to the FDA’s premarket notification and clearance process in order to be commercially distributed. 
Post-market Regulation - After a device is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
•establishment registration and device listing with the FDA;
•QSR requirements, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the design and manufacturing process;
•labeling and marketing regulations, which require that promotion is truthful, not misleading, fairly balanced and provide adequate directions for use and that all claims are substantiated, and also prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling; FDA guidance on off-label dissemination of information and responding to unsolicited requests for information;
•clearance or approval of product modifications to 510(k)-cleared devices that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices;
•medical device reporting regulations, which require that a manufacturer report to the FDA if a device it markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned and the device or a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, if the malfunction were to recur;
•correction, removal and recall reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health;
•complying with requirements governing Unique Device Identifiers on devices and also requiring the submission of certain information about each device to the FDA’s Global Unique Device Identification Database;
•the FDA’s recall authority, whereby the agency can order device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; and
•post-market surveillance activities and regulations, which apply when deemed by the FDA to be necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
Manufacturers of medical device products marketed in the United States are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and the facilities and controls for the design, manufacture, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, distribution, installation and servicing of finished devices intended for human use. The QSR also requires, among other things, maintenance of a device master file, device history file, and complaint files. Device manufacturers are also subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspections by the FDA. The FDA has broad regulatory compliance and enforcement powers. 
If the FDA determines that we failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, including a determination that our software products require prior FDA clearance or approval to be legally marketed in the United States, it can take a variety of compliance or enforcement actions, which may result in any of the following sanctions: warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; recalls, withdrawals, or administrative detention or seizure of our products; operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production; refusing or delaying requests for 510(k) marketing clearance or PMA approvals of new products or modified products; withdrawing 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals that have already been granted; refusal to grant export or import approvals for our products; or criminal prosecution.
Foreign Regulations
Our subsidiaries in the United Kingdom and Singapore are subject to additional regulations by the Government of the United Kingdom, as well as its subdivisions, and the Government of Singapore, respectively. These include federal and local corporation requirements, restrictions on exchange of funds, employment-related laws and qualification for tax status.
Foreign Data Collection. The collection and use of personal health data in the European Economic Area (EEA) is governed by various laws concerning privacy, data protection and data security, most notably the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR). The GDPR applies to any company established in the EEA as well as to those outside the EEA if they collect and use personal data in connection with offering goods or services to individuals in the EEA or the monitoring of their behavior. The GDPR enhances data protection obligations for processors and controllers of personal data, including, for example, expanded disclosures about how personal information is to be used, limitations on retention of information, mandatory data breach notification requirements and onerous new obligations on services providers. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the EEA to other countries, including the United States; in July 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union limited how organizations could lawfully transfer personal data from the EEA to the United States by invalidating the EU-US Privacy Shield and imposing further restrictions on use of the standard contractual clauses, which could increase our costs and our ability to efficiently process personal data from the EEA. Non-compliance with the GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to €20 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is higher. The GDPR may impose additional responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with data protection rules. In addition, member states of the EEA may impose further obligations relating to the processing of health data, which could further add to our compliance costs and limit how we process this information. From January 1, 2021, we may be subject to the GDPR and also the United Kingdom (UK) GDPR, which, together with the amended UK Data Protection Act 2018, retains the GDPR in UK national law. The UK GDPR mirrors the fines under the GDPR, e.g. fines up to the greater of €20 million (£17.5 million) or 4% of global turnover. The relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union in relation to certain aspects of data protection law remains unclear, and it is unclear how United Kingdom data protection laws and regulations will develop in the medium to longer term, and how data transfers to and from the United Kingdom will be regulated in the long term. Currently there is a four to six-month grace period agreed in the EU and UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, ending June 30, 2021 at the latest, while the parties discuss an adequacy decision. However, it is not clear whether (and when) an adequacy decision may be granted by the European Commission enabling data transfers from EU member states to the UK long term without additional measures. These changes will lead to additional costs and increase our overall risk exposure. We also may become subject to similar laws and regulations in other countries outside of the EEA in which we do business. 
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and Foreign Anti-Bribery Laws. The FCPA makes it illegal for U.S. persons, including U.S. companies, and their subsidiaries, directors, officers, employees, and agents, to promise, authorize or make any corrupt payment, or otherwise provide any item of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official or any foreign political party or party official to obtain or retain business. Violations of the FCPA can also result in violations of other U.S. laws, including anti-money laundering, mail and wire fraud, and conspiracy laws. There are severe penalties for violating the FCPA. In addition, the Company may also be subject to other non-U.S. anti-corruption or anti-bribery laws, such as the U.K. Bribery Act 2010.
Export Controls. Economic and trade sanctions programs that are administered by OFAC prohibit or restrict transactions to or from, and dealings with specified countries, their governments, and in certain circumstances, with individuals and entities that are specially designated nationals of those countries, and other sanctioned persons, including narcotics traffickers and terrorists or terrorist organizations. Further, federal regulations impose authorization, reporting, and/or licensing requirements prior to the export of certain software that incorporates encryption technology. These requirements may apply to our Solution to the extent that our software with encryption functionality is implemented abroad or is hosted on servers in a foreign country to provide services to customers outside the United States. In addition, various countries also regulate the import of certain encryption technology, including through import permitting and licensing requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our customers’ ability to import our technology into those countries.

Human Capital Management
At the center of the Flywheel described above is the engagement of our team members. Team member engagement is foundational to everything we do and is the #1 priority of our CEO and broader leadership team. When team members feel connected to our mission and are listened to, cared for, and respected at an extraordinary level, they produce outstanding work, which enables our customers to measurably improve. As customers realize improvements, their trust in Health Catalyst builds, their engagement in our shared work increases, and they choose to renew and expand their relationship with us, while also referring Health Catalyst to key decision-makers at other potential customers. Customer renewal, expansion, and referral produce growing, scalable, and predictable financial performance.
Our key human capital management objectives include, among others: (i) attracting, developing, and retaining a diverse and talented workforce; (ii) providing opportunities for learning, development, career growth, and movement within Health Catalyst; (iii) evaluating compensation and benefits, and rewarding performance; (iv) investing in physical, emotional, and financial health of team members; (v) obtaining team member feedback; (vi) maintaining and enhancing our culture and mission; and (vii) communicating with our board of directors on a routine basis on key topics. We have implemented and continue to develop many programs designed to achieve these priorities, some of which are further described below. 
As of December 31, 2020, we had more than 1,000 team members, almost all of whom are located in the United States. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our team member relations to be good. We encourage you to review the Environmental, Social and Governance pages of our website at https://www.healthcatalyst.com/environmental-social-governance/ (ESG Website) for more detailed information regarding our human capital programs and initiatives. The information on our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Team Member Engagement
We regularly engage with our team members to assess their job satisfaction, including conducting regular team member surveys and hosting monthly all team member meetings in which leadership answers questions from team members. We use information from these sources, among others, to improve our ability to attract, develop, and retain talented team members who will help advance our mission. 
Compensation, Benefits and Wellness 
In addition to market-competitive base pay, short-term bonus incentives, and long-term equity incentives, we provide comprehensive team member benefits and a variety of other health and wellness resources. We are committed to fair compensation and opportunity in our workplace.
Pay Equity
We are committed to ensuring our team members receive equal pay for equal work. We establish components and ranges of compensation based on market and benchmark data. Within this context, we strive to pay all employees equitably within a reasonable range, taking into consideration factors such as role; market data; internal equity; job location; relevant experience; and individual, business unit, and company performance, among others. We regularly review our compensation practices and analyze the equity of compensation decisions. We institute measures, such as communications and trainings, to recognize, interrupt and prevent bias in hiring, performance management, and compensation decisions and we provide resources to further develop managers and leaders to help them make equitable decisions about pay.
Diversity and Inclusion 
We are committed to fostering a culture of inclusion and belonging, and to building a diverse workforce to drive innovation and collective growth, which we believe is critical to our success. We continue to formalize and invest in our diversity and inclusion initiatives as further described on the ESG website listed above. These diversity and inclusion efforts – spearheaded by Trudy Sullivan, our Chief Diversity & Inclusion Officer, and our four affinity groups in partnership with hundreds of our team members – focus on diversity and inclusion in our workforce, in our workplace and in healthcare. We continue to focus upon inclusive recruitment and hiring practices to source diverse talent and mitigate potential bias throughout the hiring process, including expanding our internship program to include remote workplace options, attending Women of Color STEM and the Black Engineer of the Year Awards (BEYA) conference and job fairs and recognizing our two Modern Healthcare Technology Leader Science Spectrum Trailblazer Awards winners at BEYA. Our Shades affinity group for team members of color contributes to the marketing and design of our AI driven Health Equity Assessment and Guidance Solution to overcome disparities in care in the healthcare ecosystem. Over the past year, we continued to expand our diversity training for our team members with the creation and launch of our Diversity Dialogue Series, which included outside speakers.
Growth and Development
We invest significant resources to develop talent and actively foster a learning culture where team members are empowered to drive their personal and professional growth. We offer extensive onboarding and regular training programs to prepare our team members at all levels for career progression and individual development. We also offer annual continuing education reimbursement to allow team members to be continuous learners and seek new challenges.
Flexible Work Environment
We help our team members succeed by providing flexibility in where and how they work. For many years, we have enabled team members to have flexible work arrangements, including a large percentage of remote team members. We believe these arrangements can increase team member’s ownership, satisfaction and productivity, as well as enable us to hire from a broader, more diverse pool of talent. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we allowed all team members to be remote to protect the health, safety and wellness of our team members. We continue to support our workforce with the technology and infrastructure necessary to work from a remote location, including a work equipment and utilities reimbursement program to help our team member improve their dynamic workspaces.
