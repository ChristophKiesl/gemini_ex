Item 1. Business. 
Business Overview
 
Innodata Inc. (NASDAQ: INOD) (including its subsidiaries, the “Company”, “Innodata”, “we”, “us” or “our”) is a global data engineering company. We solve complex data challenges using artificial intelligence (AI) and human expertise.
 
We provide large-scale data annotation services and platforms to companies who require high-quality data for training AI and machine learning (ML) algorithms. We also provide AI/ML-based solutions to help companies apply AI/ML to real-world problems relating to analyzing and deriving insights from documents. For industry-specific, document-intensive industry use cases, we provide AI-augmented software-as-a-service (SaaS) platforms and discrete managed services.
 
Our platforms and services are powered by Goldengate, our proprietary AI/ML platform, as well as other technologies we have developed. In addition, we bring to bear 3,500 + employees spanning nine countries with expertise in data pertaining to many professional fields. Our hybrid approach of using AI/ML in conjunction with human experts enables us to deliver superior data quality with even the most complex and sensitive data.
 
We developed our capabilities and honed our customer- and quality-centric culture progressively over the last 30 years creating high-quality data for many of the world’s most demanding information companies. Approximately five years ago, we formed Innodata Labs, a research and development center, to research, develop and apply machine learning and emerging AI to our large-scale, human-intensive data operations. In 2019, we began packaging the capabilities that emerged from our R&D efforts in order to align with several fast-growing new markets and help companies use AI/ML to drive performance benefits and business insights. We anticipate this strategy will enable us to accelerate growth.
 
Market Opportunities
 
Data Annotation
 
Companies across industry verticals are increasingly seeking to develop AI-based applications for an ever-increasing variety of use cases such as self-driving cars, surveillance systems, automated medical diagnostics, digital assistants and chatbots and contract review. These applications depend upon high-performing AI algorithms in areas such as speech recognition, image recognition, and text recognition.
 
Unlike traditional computer applications that are programmed in languages like Python and Java to tell computers what to do, AI applications can be created with little to no programming. Instead, AI applications are trained with large quantities of input data and expected output data. Leveraging such data, the AI application learns on its own from the data itself through a series of regressions. Developing high-quality training data is critical for the AI to perform correctly, but often requires technology and skilled human resources that data science teams lack. Moreover, developing high-quality data takes up 80% of the time for most AI and ML projects.1
 
We train AI algorithms for social media companies, robotics companies, financial services companies, and many others, working with images, text, video and audio. Data sciences teams seek partners that can perform data preparation functions for them at large-scale and at high quality, while using automated tools to minimize cost. Moreover, as AI projects become more specialized and mission-critical, data preparation is becoming increasingly complex, requiring deep domain knowledge and an infrastructure in which data security is assured. We believe that Innodata is ideally situated to be such a partner.

Agility is now ranked by software review site G2 Crowd as meeting the requirements of customers better than its two largest competitors that have combined revenues of over $1 billion.8 Agility operates in the $4.5 billion media intelligence solutions market.9
 
The Company’s operations are presently classified and reported in three reporting segments: Digital Data Solutions (DDS), Synodex and Agility.
 
Competitive Strengths
 
Our Data Quality
 
We believe we achieve industry-leading data quality by leveraging our technology, our large staff of human experts, and the culture we have cultivated over many years of providing high-quality data to the most demanding customers.
 
For the past five years, we have been designing and refining our approach for combining human experts and AI to produce large-scale, highly accurate data. In our approach, AI networks automatically perform much of the required processing and human experts perform processing that the AI cannot perform at a high level of confidence. The human output is fed back into the AI networks, which, as a result, “learn” and become “smarter” over time, achieving progressively greater levels of automation while maintaining the highest levels of quality. (See “Our Technology”, below.)
 
Our 3,500+ experts have deep domain knowledge in a wide diversity of data domains. They are selected on the basis of data acumen, analytical ability, and deep domain proficiency. (See “Our Domain Experts”, below.)
 
Our culture of quality is critical to achieving and sustaining high data quality. Our culture has been cultivated over our decades of experience performing data-related tasks for leading global companies, including the four largest global information companies with which we have 10-plus year relationships building and maintaining many of their leading data products.

We maintain independent quality assurance centers that comply with and are certified to the ISO 9001:2008 quality management system standards.
 
Our Domain Experts
 
We have over 3,500+ employees with deep data domain expertise in various fields, including law, sciences, health, finance, and technology. Many of them hold advanced degrees. They process data in over 25 languages. Most work from our global operations centers in India, Israel, Germany, Sri Lanka and the Philippines. For annotating complex or sensitive data, our expert staff provides an attractive alternative to the crowdsourced labor pools utilized by many of our competitors typically for mundane tasks. They are especially well-suited for high-context data, such as legal contract classification, medical images, medical records, and scientific and legal literature.
Our Technology
 
Over the past four years, we have built a technology infrastructure that automates complex data annotation and other data engineering tasks. Our technology infrastructure combines advanced dataflow, deep learning (a branch of AI), and purpose-built applications used by human experts, which we refer to as “workbenches”. This infrastructure enables us to perform data annotation and other data engineering tasks at progressively higher levels of efficiency without compromising quality as it continuously learns from human experts.
 
Our proprietary, state-of-the-art Goldengate platform is our core AI technology stack. Goldengate accepts a wide range of documents –including images, PDFs, and web copy – and performs a series of cognitive tasks to extract intelligence and create analytical data that people can use for generating inferences and powering analytical applications. It serves up no-code AI with transfer learning built on generative language models we have developed over the past five years of deploying industrial deep neural networks. Goldengate serves as the foundational technology for the AI projects we perform for customers, as well as the AI-under-the-hood that powers our data annotation platform and our industry platforms. One of the main benefits of the platform is that it’s “no-code”, so it doesn’t require a large number of data scientists to build models or require a data science platform to orchestrate models and update models. Using Goldengate in combination with our SMEs, we are able to build high-performing, cutting-edge models that address real-world problems. Our 2021 journey is to further AI-enable Synodex, Agility and our data annotation platform using Goldengate; in 2022, we intend to commercialize it further as both a customer-facing technology and as the engine under other potential industry solutions.
 
Goldengate functionality can be consumed as domain-specific and task-specific microservices each of which performs a discrete data-related task automatically. Each AI microservice may be invoked by the dataflow via a RESTful API. Many complex data problems can be solved with a combination of these microservices. Capabilities include deep sequence labelling, categorization, segmentation and sequence-to-sequence mapping. For each cognitive task an AI microservice performs, it provides a confidence score. A confidence score at or above an established accuracy threshold means no human expert review is required. A confidence score below an established accuracy threshold means human expert review is required.
 
When expert review is required, the dataflow automatically routes data to an appropriate human expert. Our human experts use workbenches that enable them to quickly and efficiently review the data and make judgements. The workbenches then retroactively feed back the expert-reviewed work into Goldengate’s deep neural network, enabling it to learn and become smarter. This feature is commonly known as “human-in-the-loop”. It results in continuous, predictable improvement and progressively greater levels of automation.

To support our Agility industry platform, we have built a fully scalable, cloud-based infrastructure that powers a SaaS experience for global clients on a 24/7 basis. It includes (i) an AI/ML-powered big data media intelligence platform that indexes two billion media items per year, powering media monitoring, media enrichment, and media database APIs; (ii) a full targeting workflow platform that integrates media targeting, content curation, content distribution, integrated newswires, and a newsroom; (iii) a comprehensive database of more than one million global media influencers and journalists; (iv) a media monitoring and analytics engine; and (v) a workflow platform for media database research combining AI and machine learning to streamline research workflows for discovery and maintenance of our database.
 
To support our Synodex intelligent automation platform, we have built technologies for transforming imaged medical records and HL7/FHIR electronic health records (EHR) systems into digital data conforming to proprietary insurance medical data dictionaries that span diseases and impairments, diagnostic tests, pharmacology and support industry standard codes such as ICD-10 as well as rules engines for processing, analyzing and displaying the digital data.
 
Our Infrastructure
 
Our infrastructure supports a range of strategies to suit our clients’ requirements for data security, compliance, scalability and reliability. We host data and applications in our own data centers at our operations centers, in our clients’ data centers, and on third-party cloud services that provide the benefit of “infinite scalability” of hardware resources. Our data operations are linked by multiple redundant network connections. Our Wide Area Network – along with our Local Area Networks, Storage Area Networks, Network Attached Storage and data centers – are configured with industry standard redundancy, often with more than one backup to establish 24x7 availability.  In 2020, our Wide Area Network had 99.96% uptime excluding scheduled maintenance. We encrypt all sensitive information, both at rest and in transit, to the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) 256 or similar standard, and we employ a range of security features, including industry-leading managed firewalls and intrusion detection and prevention services. (See “Information Security”, below.)
 
Our Breath of Capabilities
 
We are able to address clients at their highest point of need. For example, we may provide data annotation for a data sciences team at a bank that is building an AI application to manage complex loan agreements. For another banking client with the same requirement but without a sophisticated data sciences team, we might provide a full AI/ML solution built on our proprietary Goldengate AI platform that extracts key data points from the loan agreements and outputs normalized digital data via an API to the bank’s existing application. For still another banking client that also lacked such an application, we might provide a data analytics platform.
 
Data science teams that utilize our data annotation services also often have other related needs that include data transformation, data curation, data hygiene, data consolidation, data compliance, and master data management. Unlike many of our data annotation competitors – that are essentially staffing companies – as a full-service data engineering company we are able to address these attendant requirements.
 
Our Outcomes Orientation
 
We have developed a strong customer-centric culture and a set of values designed around achieving promised outcomes for our clients. This includes proactive communication, innovation, transparency, and empathy.

Growth Strategy
 
Our strategy for growth is to align to and serve large, dynamic and rapidly growing markets related to the deployment of AI/ML in businesses. Our solutions and platforms leverage the technology, human resources, and culture of fanaticism for data quality that we have developed over the past 30 years, as well as the AI/ML research and development we have invested in over the past five years.
 
We intend to invest significantly in scaling our sales and marketing. Through most of 2020, we had 15 people in sales. Our 2021 budget, by contrast, anticipates ending 2021 with a sales team of 98 in total: 63 sales executives; 25 business development resources; and 10 sales managers and sales enablement directors. We expect this will deliver significant returns in future years.
 
We also plan to continue to invest in our proprietary text annotation platform and Goldengate AI/ML platform as sources of competitive advantage. We also plan to invest in building a proprietary resource management platform geared specifically to managing remote staff and freelancers. Prior to the global pandemic, our operating model was to almost exclusively use full-time employees working from large production centers. Propelled by the need to shift to remote working, we are presently near 100% cloud-based and remote, which has enabled us to lower fixed operating costs and achieve greater scalability.
 
We expect to fully fund these investments for growth from our internal resources without need for outside financing.
 
Our Customers
 
Our customers include leading businesses across multiple verticals including banking, insurance, financial services, technology, digital retailing and information/media. One client in the DDS segment generated approximately 14% and 16% of the Company’s total revenues in the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Another client in the DDS segment generated 10% of the Company’s total revenues for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. No other client accounted for 10% or more of total revenues during these periods. Further, in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, revenues from non-US clients accounted for 54% and 55%, respectively, of the Company's revenues.
 
We have long-standing relationships with many of our clients, and we have provided services to the two clients referenced in the preceding paragraph for over ten years. Our track record of delivering high-quality services helps us to solidify client relationships. Many of our clients are recurring clients, meaning that they have continued to provide additional projects to us after our initial engagement with them.

The Innodata Labs team is comprised of data scientists, including data scientists who have published leading papers on discrete topics in data science and have earned PhD degrees in fields such as data entity extraction.
Environmental, Social, and Governance
 
We are values-driven company, committed to continuously improving how we perform as a steward of nature, manage relationships with our employees, suppliers, customers and communities, and conduct our business.
 
While we are driven by the vision of ushering in the promise of digital data and ubiquitous AI, we are cognizant that the disruption AI will inevitably cause will not be equitably distributed. Ironically, many of the communities in which we source human capital for AI projects – communities in India, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka – are also more heavily dependent on manual labor and face greater potential disruption as a result of AI.
 
Therefore, as we set out on our AI journey five years ago, we made a concomitant commitment to do our part to help economically disadvantaged youth (especially young women) in these communities become technology-savvy. It was our aspiration that they become empowered beneficiaries of an AI-enabled world rather than its victims.
 
From 2016 to 2020, our employees have contributed over 1,400 person days to our I-Hope program, and we have contributed resources, to build 12 fully-functional computer labs at schools across India, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka. We take immense pride knowing that as a result of our work 4,426 more children are now technology proficient and ready to take on challenges of navigating an increasingly AI-enabled world. In 2020, we were the proud recipients of the Asia CEO Awards Circle of Excellence for this work followed by DSWD Philippines (Department of Social Welfare & Development) Regional Citation Award.
 
Our goal is to technology-enable 12,000 children by 2025, and we will be devoting a portion of our revenue to this worthy goal.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2020, we employed 169 persons in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, and 3,600 persons in global delivery centers in the Philippines, India, Sri Lanka, Canada, Germany, and Israel, and 3,711 of our employees are full-time. Many of our employees hold advanced degrees in law, business, technology, medicine, and social sciences.
