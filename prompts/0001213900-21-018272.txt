Item 1. Business.
Introduction
 
FSDC was formed as a blank check company incorporated on June 25, 2020 in Delaware, formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (the “business combination”). Until the consummation of the business combination, FSDC did not engage in any operations nor generate any revenue.
 
On August 14, 2020, FSDC consummated its initial public offering (the “Initial Public Offering”) of 12,075,000 shares of Class A Common Stock, generating total gross proceeds of $120,750,000. Substantially concurrent with the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, the Sponsor purchased 441,500 shares of Class A Common Stock (the “Private Placement Shares”) for an aggregate purchase price of $4,415,000, or $10.00 per share. A total of $120,750,000, comprised of the proceeds from the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Shares, were placed in a U.S.-based trust account at JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be released to FS Development to pay its taxes, the proceeds from the Initial Public Offering will not be released from the trust account until the earliest to occur of: (i) the completion of FSDC’s initial business combination, (ii) the redemption of the Public Shares if FSDC has not completed its initial business combination by August 14, 2022, subject to applicable law, and (iii) the redemption of the Public Shares properly tendered in connection with a stockholder vote to amend the current charter to modify the substance or timing of its obligation to redeem 100% of its Public Shares if FSDC does not complete its initial business combination by August 14, 2022 or with respect to any other provisions relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination activity.
 
On February 5, 2021, FSDC consummated the previously announced Business Combination. In accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time of the Merger (i) all shares of Old Gemini Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, was converted into the right to receive their pro rata portion of the 17,942,274 shares of Common Stock issued as Merger Consideration, provided that 2,150,000 shares of Common Stock are being held in escrow for a period of 12 months to satisfy any indemnification obligations of Old Gemini under the Merger Agreement; (ii) each option exercisable for Old Gemini Stock that was outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time was assumed and continues in full force and effect on the same terms and conditions as were previously applicable to such options, subject to adjustments to exercise price and number of shares Common Stock issuable upon exercise based on the final conversion ratio calculated in accordance with the Merger Agreement, and (iii) 4,264,341 shares of Common Stock were reserved for issuance under the newly adopted 2021 Plan.
 
In connection with the Closing, the PIPE Investors subscribed for an aggregate of 9,506,000 shares of Common Stock for an aggregate purchase price of $95,060,000.
 
In connection with the Business Combination, 100 shares of Class A common Stock of FSDC were redeemed at a per share purchase price of approximately $10.00. Upon the Closing, Gemini had 42,998,664 shares of Common Stock outstanding.

Employees
 
As of December 31, 2020 and prior to the business combination, we had three executive officers. These individuals were not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intended to devote as much of their time as they deemed necessary to our affairs until we completed an initial business combination. The amount of time they devoted in any time period varied based on the stage of the business combination process we were in. We had no full-time employees prior to the completion of the business combination.
