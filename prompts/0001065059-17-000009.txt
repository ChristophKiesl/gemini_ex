Item 1. Business
Overview
Centrus Energy Corp. (“Centrus” or the “Company”) is a trusted supplier of low-enriched uranium (“LEU”) for commercial nuclear power plants. References to “Centrus”, the “Company”, or “we” include Centrus Energy Corp. and its wholly owned subsidiaries as well as the predecessor to Centrus, unless the context otherwise indicates. LEU is a critical component in the production of nuclear fuel for reactors that produce electricity. We supply LEU to both domestic and international utilities for use in nuclear reactors worldwide. We are a leader in the development of advanced uranium enrichment technology and are performing research and demonstration work to support U.S. energy and national security through our contract with UT-Battelle, LLC (“UT-Battelle”), the operator of Oak Ridge National Laboratory (“ORNL”).
As a long-term supplier of LEU to our customers, our goal is to provide value through the reliability and diversity of our supply sources. We provide LEU from multiple sources including our inventory, medium- and long- term supply contracts and spot purchases. Our long-term objective is to resume commercial enrichment production and we are exploring alternative approaches to that end. 
We have a contract with UT-Battelle to conduct research and development of our advanced centrifuge technology for the U.S. government. We believe that this technology could play a critical role in meeting our national and energy security needs and achieving our nation’s non-proliferation objectives.
The nuclear industry in general, and the nuclear fuel industry in particular, is in a period of significant change, which could significantly transform the competitive landscape Centrus faces. The nuclear fuel cycle industry remains oversupplied, creating downward pressures on commodity pricing, with uncertainty regarding the timing of industry expansion globally. Changes in the competitive landscape may adversely affect pricing trends, change customer spending patterns, or create uncertainty. To address these changes, we may seek to adjust our cost structure and operations and evaluate opportunities to grow our business organically or through acquisitions and other strategic transactions. We are actively considering, and expect to consider from time to time in the future, potential strategic transactions, which could involve, without limitation, acquisitions and/or dispositions of businesses or assets, joint ventures or investments in businesses, products or technologies. In connection with any such transaction, we may seek additional debt or equity financing, contribute or dispose of assets, assume additional indebtedness, or partner with other parties to consummate a transaction. 
Our Business Today
In 2016, Centrus continued to demonstrate why it is a trusted partner to the global nuclear industry. During the year, Centrus’ management team positioned the Company for long-term success with a focus on strengthening our strategic relationships within the nuclear industry, expanding sales to both new and existing customers, and pursuing new business development opportunities.
Our competitive strengths include:

• | Positioned for the long term: Centrus has long-term sales and supply contracts in place that extend well into the next decade, which will provide a stream of revenue for many years and provides a foundation for growth as the global enrichment market recovers. Without the large capital and overhead costs of a production facility, Centrus is positioned to continue to obtain supply at competitive prices from an oversupplied market, which we believe will strengthen our position for the future.

• | Diverse supply portfolio: Centrus’ leadership team is focused on expanding and diversifying our supply base to provide additional value to our customers. For example, Centrus has entered into new agreements with suppliers of enriched uranium, expanding our sources of supply and increasing the number of possible delivery locations for enriched uranium. In late 2015, Centrus also successfully completed a renegotiation with our Russian supplier under our primary supply contract to better align our purchase obligations in light of market conditions generally, our sales order book, and restrictions on the import of Russian LEU and to extend the agreement to at least 2026. In addition, Centrus has acquired or will acquire additional enriched uranium supply from the excess inventories of utility operators of nuclear power plants and from other primary and secondary sources of enriched uranium supply. Together, this portfolio makes Centrus a highly diversified supplier of LEU. 


• | Developing U.S. enrichment technology: Centrus continues to demonstrate its core expertise and world-leading technical, engineering and manufacturing capabilities in Oak Ridge, Tennessee through our contract with the operator of ORNL. Centrus is continuing to advance its U.S. centrifuge technology with a view to deploying a commercial scale enrichment facility over the long term once market conditions recover. We continue to pursue strategic relationships that would capitalize on Centrus’ unique assets, including our operational expertise and our significant technical capabilities. 

We believe that Centrus’ position as a leading provider of enriched uranium and our long-standing global relationships will enable an increase in future market share for the Company. We are well-positioned to capitalize on our heritage, industry-wide relationships, and diversity of supply to provide reliable and competitive sources of enriched uranium. Centrus continues to be valued by our customers as a source of diversity, stability, and competition in the enrichment market. Moreover, our smaller size and lower fixed costs can be advantageous in the current excess capacity market.

For a discussion of the potential risks and uncertainties facing our business, see Item 1A, Risk Factors.
Uranium and Enrichment
LEU consists of two components: separative work units (“SWU”) and uranium. Uranium is a naturally occurring element and is mined from deposits located in Kazakhstan, Canada, Australia, the United States and several other countries. According to the World Nuclear Association, there are adequate measured resources of uranium to fuel nuclear power at current usage rates for about 90 years. In its natural state, uranium is principally comprised of two isotopes: uranium-235 (“U235”) and uranium-238 (“U238”). The concentration of U235 in natural uranium is only 0.711% by weight. Most commercial nuclear power reactors require LEU fuel with a U235 concentration greater than natural uranium and up to 5% by weight. Uranium enrichment is the process by which the concentration of U235 is increased to that level. 
SWU is a standard unit of measurement that represents the effort required to transform a given amount of natural uranium into two components: enriched uranium having a higher percentage of U235 and depleted uranium having a lower percentage of U235. The SWU contained in LEU is calculated using an industry standard formula based on the physics of enrichment. The amount of enrichment deemed to be contained in LEU under this formula is commonly referred to as its SWU component and the quantity of natural uranium used in the production of LEU under this formula is referred to as its uranium or “feed” component. 
While in some cases customers purchase both the SWU and uranium components of LEU from us, utility customers typically provide uranium to us as part of their enrichment contracts, and in exchange we deliver LEU to these customers and charge for the SWU component. Title to uranium provided by customers generally remains with the customer until delivery of LEU, at which time title to LEU is transferred to the customer and we take title to the uranium.

The following outlines the steps for converting natural uranium into LEU fuel, commonly known as the nuclear fuel cycle:
Mining and Milling. Natural, or unenriched, uranium is removed from the earth in the form of ore and then crushed and concentrated. 
Conversion. Uranium concentrates (“U3O8”) are combined with fluorine gas to produce uranium hexafluoride (“UF6”), a solid at room temperature and a gas when heated. UF6 is shipped to an enrichment plant. 
Enrichment. UF6 is enriched in a process that increases the concentration of the U235 isotope in the UF6 from its natural state of 0.711% up to 5%, which is usable as a fuel for light water commercial nuclear power reactors. 
Fuel Fabrication. LEU is then converted to uranium oxide and formed into small ceramic pellets by fabricators. The pellets are loaded into metal tubes that form fuel assemblies, which are shipped to nuclear power plants.
Nuclear Power Plant. The fuel assemblies are loaded into nuclear reactors to create energy from a controlled chain reaction. Nuclear power plants generate approximately 20% of U.S. electricity and 11% of the world’s electricity.
Used Fuel Storage. After the nuclear fuel has been in a reactor for several years, its efficiency is reduced and the assembly is removed from the reactor’s core. The used fuel is warm and radioactive and is kept in a deep pool of water for several years. Many utilities have elected to then move the used fuel into steel or concrete and steel casks for interim storage.
Products and Services
Low-Enriched Uranium 
Revenue from our LEU segment is derived primarily from:

• | sales of the SWU component of LEU,


• | sales of both the SWU and uranium components of LEU, and


• | sales of natural uranium.

Revenue for our LEU segment accounted for approximately 88% of our total revenue in 2016. Our customers are primarily domestic and international utilities that operate nuclear power plants. Our agreements with electric utilities are primarily long-term, fixed-commitment contracts under which our customers are obligated to purchase a specified quantity of the SWU component of LEU (or the SWU and uranium components of LEU) from us. Our agreements for natural uranium sales are generally shorter-term, fixed-commitment contracts.
Contract Services
As described below under Advanced Technology, Manufacturing, and Engineering Capability, we perform American Centrifuge engineering and testing activities as a contractor for UT-Battelle, the management and operating contractor of ORNL for the U.S Department of Energy (“DOE”). Revenue and cost of sales for work that we perform as a contractor to UT-Battelle are reported in the contract services segment.

SWU and Uranium Sales Order Book
The SWU component of LEU is typically bought and sold under long-term contracts with deliveries over several years. Our order book of sales under contract (“order book”) extends for more than a decade. As of December 31, 2016, our order book was $1.4 billion compared to $2.3 billion at December 31, 2015. As previously disclosed, some long-term contracts in our order book were established with milestones related to the deployment of the American Centrifuge Plant (“ACP”) in Piketon, Ohio, that permit termination with respect to portions of the contract under limited circumstances. The decline in the order book during 2016 includes $0.7 billion of future sales that were cancelled following customer termination for unmet milestones. We estimate that approximately 5% of our order book as of December 31, 2016, remains at risk due to milestones related to ACP deployment, down from 35% as of December 31, 2015. 
We anticipate SWU and uranium revenue from the sales currently under contract in our order book in a range of $175 million to $200 million during 2017.
Most of our contracts provide for fixed purchases of SWU during a given year. Our estimate of the aggregate dollar amount of future SWU and uranium sales is partially based on customers’ estimates of the timing and size of their fuel requirements and other assumptions that are subject to change. For example, depending on the terms of 
7

specific contracts, the customer may be able to increase or decrease the quantity delivered within an agreed range. Our order book estimate is also based on our estimates of selling prices, which are subject to change. For example, depending on the terms of specific contracts, prices may be adjusted based on escalation using a general inflation index, published SWU price indicators prevailing at the time of delivery, and other factors, all of which are variable. We use external composite forecasts of future market prices and inflation rates in our pricing estimates. Refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors, for a discussion of risks related to our order book.
Russian Supply Agreement
 Our leading supplier of SWU is the Russian government entity Joint Stock Company “TENEX” (“TENEX”). Under a 2011 agreement with TENEX (the “Russian Supply Agreement”), we purchase SWU contained in LEU received from TENEX, and we deliver natural uranium to TENEX for the LEU’s uranium component. In December 2015, we successfully negotiated an amendment to the Russian Supply Agreement to better align our purchase obligations in light of market conditions generally, our sales order book, and restrictions on the import of Russian LEU. The amendment extended the Russian Supply Agreement beyond 2022 and gives us the right to reschedule quantities of SWU into the period 2023-2026, in return for the purchase of additional SWU in those years. Depending on the total purchase obligations rescheduled to 2023-2026, we may defer certain limited quantities beyond 2026.
The LEU that we obtain from TENEX under the Russian Supply Agreement is subject to quotas and other restrictions that could adversely affect our ability to sell the SWU component that we purchase in the United States and other markets. The Russian Supply Agreement only gives us the right to use a portion of this quota, which is less than the amount of Russian LEU that we need to order to meet our SWU purchase obligations to TENEX. We can ask TENEX for additional quota, which they can allocate to us at their discretion. Refer below to Competition and Foreign Trade - Limitations on Imports of LEU from Russia. 
We expect that a portion of the Russian LEU that we order during the term of the Russian Supply Agreement will need to be delivered to customers who will use it in foreign reactors. The Russian LEU that we deliver to foreign customers can be delivered either at fabrication facilities in the United States or in foreign countries. The amount of SWU we must purchase from TENEX under the Russian Supply Agreement exceeds our current sales order book and therefore we will need to make new sales to place all the Russian LEU we must order to meet our SWU purchase obligations to TENEX. In addition, due to quotas and other limitations, not all of our delivery obligations under our existing contracts can be met with Russian LEU. We procure LEU from other sources in order to supply the customers who cannot be supplied effectively with Russian LEU or from our existing inventory. 
Advanced Technology, Manufacturing, and Engineering Capability
The Company has a long record as a global leader in advanced technology, manufacturing and engineering. Our manufacturing, engineering and testing facilities and our highly-trained workforce are deeply engaged in advancing the next generation of uranium enrichment technology. We are exploring a number of options for returning to domestic production in the future. The economics for commercial deployment of new enrichment capacity are severely challenged by the current supply/demand imbalance in the market for LEU and related downward pressure on market prices for SWU, which are now at historic lows. Market conditions, however, are expected to improve in the long term.
Since September 2015, our government contracts with UT-Battelle have provided for continued engineering and testing work on the American Centrifuge technology at the Company’s facilities in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. In October 2015, DOE issued a report to Congress evaluating a range of possible technologies to restore U.S. domestic uranium enrichment to meet U.S. national security needs through 2041. DOE’s report stated that the American Centrifuge is the “most technically advanced and lowest risk option” for restoring U.S. uranium enrichment capability to meet long-term national security requirements. In September 2016, we entered into a new contract with UT-Battelle valued at approximately $25 million for the period from October 1, 2016, through September 30, 2017. The contract provides for payments for monthly reports of approximately $2.0 million per month and additional 
8

aggregate payments of $1.0 million based on completion of certain milestones. The contract is currently being funded incrementally. Funding for the program is provided to UT-Battelle by the federal government which is currently operating under a continuing resolution.
In September 2015, Centrus completed a successful three-year demonstration of the existing American Centrifuge technology at its facility in Piketon, Ohio, with 120 machines linked together in a cascade to simulate industrial operating conditions. On February 19, 2016, we announced our decision to commence with the decontamination and decommissioning (“D&D”) of the Piketon demonstration cascade, and to reduce staffing levels. Refer below to Facility Decontamination and Decommissioning. We lease the Piketon facility from DOE and the current lease term is through June 2019. We have the option to extend the lease term for additional five-year terms. Rent is based on the cost of lease administration and regulatory oversight in Piketon and was approximately $1.5 million for 2016. DOE may terminate for default, including if DOE is able to exercise its remedies with respect to the ACP under our agreement dated June 17, 2002, as amended (the “2002 DOE-USEC Agreement”), or if there is an uncured production shortfall. The lease provides DOE with the right to terminate upon notice and applicable cure period in the event we fail to produce an average of 1 million SWU per year measured over a rolling two year performance period commencing with the two year period starting in April 2011. We are not currently producing SWU. In the event DOE issues a notice under the lease, we would have 180 days to cure or to begin to cure if more than 180 days are reasonably required to cure.
Competition and Foreign Trade
We estimate that the enrichment industry market is currently about 50 million SWU per year. Our global market share is approximately 4 percent. Global LEU suppliers compete in the highly competitive industry primarily in terms of price and secondarily on reliability of supply and customer service. The three largest LEU suppliers comprise an estimated 90 percent of market share combined:

• | Rosatom, a Russian government entity, which sells LEU through its wholly owned subsidiary TENEX;


• | Urenco, a consortium of companies owned or controlled by the British and Dutch governments and by two German utilities; and


• | Areva, a company largely owned by the French government.

The production capacity for Rosatom/TENEX is estimated by the World Nuclear Association (“WNA”) to be approximately 27 million SWU per year. Imports of LEU and other uranium products produced in the Russian Federation are subject to restrictions through 2020 as described below under Limitations on Imports of LEU from Russia.
Urenco reported installed capacity at its European and U.S. enrichment facilities of 18.8 million SWU per year at the end of 2016, down from 19.1 million at the end of 2015. Over the course of 2016, Urenco officials have said that the company is no longer replacing older centrifuge machines that wear out, that it has taken two production halls offline at its Capenhurst site, and that it is no longer expanding enrichment capacity in the current market.
Areva’s gas centrifuge enrichment plant in France began commercial operations in 2011 and more than 95% of the plant’s nominal capacity of 7.5 million SWU was reportedly in service by the end of 2016. Areva has reported that it has suspended planned capacity expansions beyond 7.5 million SWU.
All of our current competitors are owned or controlled, in whole or in part, by foreign governments. These competitors may make business decisions in both domestic and international markets that are influenced by political or economic policy considerations rather than exclusively by commercial considerations.
There are also producers of LEU in China, Japan and Brazil that primarily serve a portion of their respective domestic markets. China is emerging as a growing producer and has begun to supply LEU to international markets. China’s commercial SWU production capacity is estimated to be approximately 7 million SWU per year. Additional capacity is also under construction which may increase capacity up to 12 million SWU per year by 2020.
9

In addition, Global Laser Enrichment, a joint venture of General Electric, Hitachi and Cameco, has an agreement with Silex Systems Limited, an Australian company, to license Silex’s laser enrichment technology. 
LEU may also be produced by down-blending government stockpiles of highly enriched uranium. Governments control the timing and availability of highly enriched uranium released for this purpose, and the release of this material to the market could impact market conditions. Given the current oversupplied nuclear fuel market, any additional LEU from down-blended highly enriched uranium released into the market would have a negative effect on prices for LEU.
LEU we supply to foreign customers is exported under the terms of international agreements governing nuclear cooperation between the United States and the country of destination or other entities, such as the European Union or the International Atomic Energy Agency. The LEU supplied to us under the Russian Supply Agreement is subject to the terms of cooperation agreements between the Russian Federation and the country of destination or other entities.
Limitations on Imports of LEU from Russia
Imports into the United States of LEU and other uranium products produced in the Russian Federation, including LEU imported under the Russian Supply Agreement, are subject to quotas imposed under legislation enacted into law in September 2008 and under the 1992 Russian Suspension Agreement, as amended in 2008. These quotas limit the amount of Russian LEU that can be imported into the United States for U.S. consumption. The quotas apply through 2020 and for 2014-2020, are set at an amount equal to approximately 20% of projected annual U.S. consumption of LEU, based on a market report published in 2005 by the World Nuclear Association (“2005 WNA Report”). 
As an exception to the quotas on imports of LEU for U.S. consumption, both the Russian Suspension Agreement and the September 2008 legislation permit unlimited imports of Russian LEU for use in initial cores for any new U.S. nuclear reactor. 
It is possible that the quotas on imports of Russian LEU could change. Both the Russian Suspension Agreement and the September 2008 legislation permit the Secretary of Commerce to increase the quotas for imports of Russian LEU for consumption in the United States in situations where supply is insufficient to meet U.S. demand for LEU. In addition, both the Russian Suspension Agreement and the September 2008 legislation require the U.S. Department of Commerce (“DOC”) to adjust the quotas in 2016 and 2019 based on changes in projected reactor demand as forecast by the World Nuclear Association. In 2016, the DOC preliminarily determined that the adjustment would increase the quotas, but this increase was challenged by U.S. uranium mining companies, and the DOC has yet to announce the final results of the 2016 adjustment. This adjustment could result in an increase or decrease of the quotas but is not expected to affect deliveries under contracts that were unconditionally approved by the DOC prior to the change.
Aside from the quotas on imports of Russian LEU that will be consumed in the United States, there is a separate quota that applies to deliveries of Russian LEU to foreign customers at U.S. fabrication facilities. This quota generally requires that the LEU be processed and re-exported within a certain period of time. In 2014, the DOC approved our proposal that Japanese customers with existing contracts with our subsidiary be allowed to physically store Russian LEU in the United States pending the restart of nuclear reactors in Japan. Under this approval, Japanese customers who wish to store Russian LEU in the United States pending restart of their reactors can do so under conditions intended to protect the U.S. market while the material is in storage. This material would not have to be re-exported until it is withdrawn from storage.
10

Beginning in February 2017, the Russian Suspension Agreement is subject to two “sunset” reviews being conducted by the DOC and the U.S. International Trade Commission (“ITC”), respectively, that will determine if the Russian Suspension Agreement should be maintained. These “sunset” reviews are required to be conducted every five years. This is the fourth round of “sunset reviews” of the Russian Suspension Agreement. The last round of reviews in 2011-12 concluded that termination of the Russian Suspension Agreement would lead to the continuation or recurrence of dumping of French LEU (a determination made by the DOC), and to the continuation or recurrence of material injury to the U.S. uranium industry (a determination made by the ITC), which resulted in the Russian Suspension Agreement being maintained. Even if the Russian Suspension Agreement were terminated as a result of the “sunset” reviews, the quotas under the September 2008 legislation would remain in place.
At the end of 2020, the Russian Suspension Agreement (and the antidumping order that it suspended), as well as the quotas under the September 2008 legislation, will expire. Accordingly, beginning in 2021, all the quotas on imports of Russian LEU will no longer apply.
Limitations on Imports of LEU from France
The DOC imposed an antidumping order on imports of French LEU in 2002.  The order is subject to periodic “sunset reviews” of the antidumping order to determine if it should be revoked. The next review will be held in 2018. Accordingly, at present, we expect that the antidumping order on French LEU will remain in place through at least 2018.
Facility Decontamination and Decommissioning
We produced LEU through May 2013 at the Paducah gaseous diffusion plant (“Paducah GDP”) in Paducah, Kentucky that we had leased from DOE. We then repackaged and transferred our existing inventory to off-site licensed locations under agreements with the operators of those facilities. Our prior enrichment operations generated hazardous, low-level radioactive and mixed wastes. The storage, treatment, and disposal of wastes are regulated by federal and state laws. The treatment and disposal of wastes from our prior operations at the Paducah GDP were completed in 2016. Regarding our past operations at the former Portsmouth GDP in Piketon, Ohio, DOE agreed in 2011 to accept ownership of all nuclear material at the site, some of which required processing for waste disposal. We agreed to pay DOE for costs for disposing of our share of such wastes. Centrus has a recorded liability of $0.2 million as of December 31, 2016, for the processing of remaining waste quantities.
The Portsmouth and Paducah gaseous diffusion plants were operated by agencies of the U.S. government for approximately 40 years prior to the Company’s privatization in 1998. As a result of such operation, there is contamination and other potential environmental liabilities associated with the plants. The USEC Privatization Act and the Company’s former leases for the plants provide that DOE remains responsible for the D&D of the gaseous diffusion plants. 
Centrus continues to lease the portion of the DOE facility in Piketon, Ohio, associated with the American Centrifuge advanced technology project. At the conclusion of the lease, Centrus is obligated to return the facility to DOE in a condition that meets NRC requirements and in the same condition as the facility was in when it was leased to Centrus (other than due to normal wear and tear). Centrus must remove all Company-owned capital improvements at the Piketon facility, unless otherwise consented to by DOE, by the conclusion of the lease term. The lease will expire on June 30, 2019, unless it is extended. Effective October 1, 2015, the U.S. government discontinued funding of the American Centrifuge demonstration cascade at Piketon. Centrus began to incur expenditures in the second quarter of 2016 associated with the D&D of the American Centrifuge facilities in Piketon in accordance with the requirements of the NRC and DOE. As of December 31, 2016, Centrus has a recorded liability of $38.6 million on the balance sheet for the estimated fair value of the remaining costs to complete the D&D work. Refer to Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.
