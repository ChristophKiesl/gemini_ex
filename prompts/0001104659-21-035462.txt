ITEM 1     BUSINESS
Weyco Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) engage in one line of business: the design and distribution of quality and innovative footwear. The Company designs and markets footwear principally for men, but also for women and children, under a portfolio of well-recognized brand names including: Florsheim, Nunn Bush, Stacy Adams, BOGS, and Rafters. Trademarks maintained by the Company on its brands are important to the business. The Company’s products consist primarily of mid-priced leather dress shoes and casual footwear composed of man-made materials or leather, as well as outdoor boots, shoes, and sandals. The Company’s footwear is available in a broad range of sizes and widths, primarily purchased to meet the needs and desires of the general American population.
The Company purchases finished shoes from outside suppliers, primarily located in China and India. Almost all of these foreign-sourced purchases are denominated in U.S. dollars. Costs from the Company’s suppliers have been relatively stable although, in recent years, there have been upward cost pressures due to higher labor, materials and freight costs, as well as due to tariffs and other trade protection measures. While there was some disruption in the Company's supply chain in early 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic, the Company's distribution center and supply chain are fully operational.
The Company’s business is separated into two reportable segments – the North American wholesale segment (“wholesale”) and the North American retail segment (“retail”). The Company also has other wholesale and retail businesses overseas which include its businesses in Australia, South Africa and Asia Pacific (collectively, “Florsheim Australia”), and its wholesale and retail businesses in Europe (“Florsheim Europe”). In late 2020, the Company decided to close Florsheim Europe, which includes a small wholesale business and two retail stores. Total sales at Florsheim Europe were $2.6 million in 2020. The closing of Florsheim Europe is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Sales of the Company’s wholesale segment, which include both wholesale sales and worldwide licensing revenues, constituted 78% and 80% of total net sales in 2020 and 2019, respectively. At wholesale, shoes are marketed throughout the United States and Canada in more than 10,000 shoe, clothing and department stores. In 2020 and 2019, no individual customer represented 10% or more of the Company’s total net sales. The Company employs traveling salespeople and independent sales representatives who sell the Company’s products to retail outlets. Shoes are shipped to these retailers primarily from the Company’s distribution center in Glendale, Wisconsin. In the men’s footwear business, there is generally no identifiable seasonality, although new styles are historically developed and shown twice each year, in spring and fall. With the BOGS brand, which mainly sells winter and outdoor boots, there is seasonality in its business due to the nature of the product; the majority of BOGS sales occur in the third and fourth quarters. Consistent with industry practices, the Company carries significant amounts of inventory to meet customer delivery requirements and periodically provides extended payment terms to customers. The Company also has licensing agreements with third parties who sell its branded shoes outside of the United States, as well as licensing agreements with specialty shoe, apparel and accessory manufacturers in the United States.
Sales of the Company’s retail segment constituted 11% and 8% of total net sales in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The retail segment consists of e-commerce businesses and four brick and mortar stores in the United States. Retail sales are made directly to the consumer by Company employees. The Company believes that as a result of the reduction in brick and mortar stores, the future results of its U.S. retail segment will be driven by its more profitable e-commerce businesses. As a result, management intends to focus on investing in and growing the e-commerce businesses.
Sales of the Company’s other businesses constituted 11% and 12% of total net sales in 2020 in 2019, respectively. These sales relate to the Company’s wholesale and retail operations in Australia, South Africa, Asia Pacific and Europe. 
Government-mandated shutdowns of non-essential businesses due to the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic resulted in the majority of retailers in the U.S. temporarily closing their stores in mid-March 2020, with the majority of retailers, including the Company’s retail stores, remaining closed for a majority of the second quarter. The Company’s overseas business were also impacted by COVID-19. Due to government mandates in Australia, much of the country was subject to prolonged shutdowns in 2020.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company employed 556 persons worldwide, of whom 414 were full-time employees. 
Price, quality, service and brand recognition are all important competitive factors in the shoe industry. The Company has a design department that continually reviews and updates product designs. Compliance with environmental and other government regulations historically have not had, and are not expected to have, a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or cash flows, although there can be no assurances.
