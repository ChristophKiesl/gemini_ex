Our Current Business



We are a biotechnology company focused in the field of regenerative medicine, and a leading developer of placenta-based cell therapy product candidates for the treatment of multiple inflammatory, muscle injuries and hematologic conditions. Our operations are focused on the research, development, manufacturing, conducting clinical trials and business development of cell therapeutics and related technologies.



Placental expanded, or PLX, cells are derived from a class of placental cells that are harvested from donated placenta at the time of full term healthy delivery of a baby. The cells are grown using our proprietary three-dimensional expansion technology and can be administered to patients off the-shelf, without blood or tissue matching prior to administration. PLX cells are believed to release a range of therapeutic proteins in response to the patient’s condition, such as inflammation, muscle trauma, hematological disorders and radiation damage.



We are conducting several multinational clinical studies which consist of a Phase III clinical study in muscle recovery following surgery for hip fracture and two Phase II clinical studies in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, or ARDS, associated with COVID-19 in the United States, Europe and Israel. In addition, we are focusing on other clinical programs in the hematological field such as a Phase I clinical study for incomplete recovery following bone marrow transplantation in the United States and Israel, an investigator-led Phase I/II Chronic Graft versus Host Disease, or cGVHD, study in Israel, and Acute Radiation Syndrome, or ARS, under the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, animal rule. We believe that each of these indications is a severe unmet medical need.



Our manufacturing facility complies with the European, Japanese, Israeli, South Korean and the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, requirements and has been inspected and approved by the European and Israeli regulators for production of PLX-PAD for late stage trials. We have also been granted manufacturer/importer authorization and cGMP Certification by the Israeli Ministry of Health, or MOH. If we obtain FDA and other regulatory approvals to market PLX cells, we expect to have in-house production capacity to grow PLX cells in commercial quantities.



Our goal is to make significant progress with our clinical pipeline and our clinical studies in order to ultimately bring innovative, potent therapies to patients who need new treatment options. We expect to demonstrate a real-world impact and value from our pipeline, technology platform and commercial-scale manufacturing capacity. Our business model for commercialization and revenue generation includes, but is not limited to, licensing deals, joint ventures with pharmaceutical companies, direct sale of our products, and partnerships.



We were incorporated in Nevada in 2001, and we have a wholly owned subsidiary in Israel called Pluristem Ltd., or the Israeli Subsidiary, and a wholly owned subsidiary in Germany called Pluristem GmbH.



Scientific Background 



Cell therapy is an emerging field within the regenerative medicine area. The characteristics and properties of cells vary as a function of tissue source and growth conditions. The human placenta from which our PLX cells are derived provides an uncontroversial source of non-embryonic, adult cells and represents an innovative approach in the cell therapy field. The different factors that PLX cells release suggest that the cells can be used therapeutically for a variety of ischemic, inflammatory, autoimmune and hematological deficiencies.



PLX cells do not require tissue matching prior to administration, which allows the development of ready-to-use / “off-the-shelf” allogeneic products.

Our Technology 



We develop, and intend to commercialize, cell therapy production technologies and products that are derived from the human placenta after a full-term delivery of a healthy baby. Our PLX cells are adherent stromal cells that are expanded using a proprietary three-dimensional, or 3D, process. This system utilizes a synthetic scaffold to create an artificial 3D environment where placental-derived stromal cells can grow. Our automated proprietary 3D, cGMP approved, process enables the large-scale monitored and controlled production of reproducible, high quality cell products and can manufacture a large number of PLX doses. Additionally, our current manufacturing process, which has scaled up as compared to previous years, has demonstrated batch-to-batch consistency, an important manufacturing challenge for biological products.
Product Candidates 



Our primary objective is to be the leading provider of allogeneic placenta-based cell therapy products that are true off-the-shelf products that do not require any matching or additional manipulation prior to administration. From the physician’s and patient’s perspective, we believe that our PLX products are comparable to any other product delivered in a vial. Currently, our PLX products are administered intramuscular, or IM, using a standard needle and syringe.
PLX-PAD



Our first product candidate, PLX-PAD, is composed of maternal cells originating from the placenta. PLX-PAD is currently being used in a Phase III multinational clinical study in recovery following surgery for hip fracture, and in two Phase II clinical studies in ARDS associated with COVID-19 in the United States, Europe and Israel.



We have also conducted a pivotal Phase III multinational clinical study in the use of PLX-PAD for the treatment of Critical Limb Ischemia, or CLI, which we terminated in December 2020, and in a Phase II multinational clinical study in Intermittent Claudication, or IC.



PLX-PAD is also under clinical development in collaboration with Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center (Ichilov Hospital) through an investigator initiated study, and used in a Phase I/II for the treatment of Steroid-Refractory cGVHD.



PLX-R18



Our second product candidate, PLX-R18, is composed of fetal cells originated from the placenta.



We have completed enrollment in our first in human Phase I clinical study in incomplete hematopoietic recovery following hematopoietic cell transplantation, or HCT, in the United States and Israel.



Through our collaboration in the United States with the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, and the U.S. Department of Defense, or DoD, we are also developing a solution for ARS following or before exposure to massive radiation via the FDA Animal Rule regulatory pathway.



Modified PLX cells



In the last decade, we developed an allogeneic platform based on cells originated from the fetal and maternal cell from the placenta, and by using this platform we can produce large quantities of high-quality cells in automated and robust manufacturing suitable for cGMP environment. As a platform technology company, we are currently developing additional product candidates, which are modified or induced PLX cells:




Induced PLX cells: we are using cells from the placenta, induced with inflammatory cytokines, to transiently alter their secretion profile.



Modified PLX cells using CRISPR technology: CRISPR is a unique technology that opens the door for precise gene editing of cells. Using such technology can initiate the next evolution in cell therapy by allowing the reprograming of cells for specific needs. Our aim is to incorporate the genetic engineering techniques into our cell manufacturing platform in order to develop large scale allogenic engineered PLX products designed for specific indications.



We believe that using the placenta as a unique cell source, combined with our innovative research, development and high-quality manufacturing capabilities, will be the “engine” that drives this platform technology towards the successful development of additional PLX cell therapy products and indications.

Our Clinical Development Product Candidates 



Orthopedic Indications. Following FDA and European Medicine Agency, or EMA, clearance, a multinational Phase III study is currently being conducted in the United States, Europe and Israel. The primary endpoint of this study is the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), a test for lower leg performance and functional status. The study is planned to include 240 patients and will assess efficacy at six months and a year, as well as safety for up to two years. Currently, over 95% of the study patients have been enrolled in this study.



Our Phase III study protocol and design was based on our phase I/II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (n=20) to assess the safety and efficacy of IM injections of allogeneic PLX-PAD cells for the regeneration of injured gluteal musculature after total hip replacement had been conducted in Germany under the approval of PEI. In this study, PLX-PAD cells or placebo were administered into the traumatized gluteal muscle during total hip replacement surgery. The study results met its primary efficacy endpoint, change in maximal voluntary isometric contraction force of the gluteal muscle at six months after total hip replacement. Patients treated with PLX-PAD had a significantly greater improvement of maximal voluntary muscle contraction force than the placebo group (p=0.0067). In addition, the study demonstrated that PLX-PAD was safe and well tolerated by patients.



COVID-19 Complicated by ARDS. In May 2020, the FDA cleared our Investigational New Drug Application, or IND, for a Phase II study of our PLX-PAD cells for treatment of severe COVID-19 cases complicated by ARDS and we initiated the study in June 2020. The U.S. study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, parallel-group intended to evaluate the efficacy and safety of IM injections of PLX-PAD for the treatment of severe COVID-19 cases complicated by ARDS. The primary endpoint is the number of ventilator free days during the 28-days following dosing. Secondary efficacy endpoints include all-cause mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU free-days, and hospitalization free-days. Safety and survival follow-up will be conducted until week 52. In addition, the FDA has cleared our Expanded Access Program, or EAP, for the use of our PLX-PAD cells to treat ARDS caused by COVID-19 outside of the Phase II COVID-19 complicated by ARDS study in the United States. The EAP approval was for up to 100 patients.



In August 2020, the PEI cleared our Phase II study in Germany titled, “A Randomized, Controlled, Multicenter, Parallel-Group Phase II Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Intramuscular Injections of PLX PAD for the Treatment of severe COVID-19,” relating to the treatment of patients hospitalized with severe cases of COVID-19 complicated by ARDS. The primary efficacy endpoint of the study is the number of ventilator free days during the 28-days from day one through day 28 of the study. Secondary efficacy endpoints include all-cause mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU free-days, and hospitalization free-days. Safety and survival follow-up will be conducted until week 52. We enrolled patients in Europe and Israel under this protocol.



On July 8, 2021, we announced that we are bringing our COVID-19 complicated by ARDS Phase II studies in the United States, Europe and Israel to clinical readout. The analysis will be based on 89 patients enrolled. We expect to announce the topline results of the readout during the fourth quarter of 2021. We also announced that we will not pursue the previously announced plans in December 2020 to expand our COVID-19 program in Mexico in collaboration with Innovare R&D SA de CV.



Recovery Following HCT. This Phase I study of PLX-R18 in HCT, has completed enrollment of 21 patients in the United States and Israel. The study is designed to assess the safety of PLX-R18 by assessing adverse events, safety labs and vital signs in patients receiving different doses of PLX-R18. We expect to complete one year follow up for all patients in September 2021. In April 2021, we announced topline results of this study. The 21 patients enrolled in the United States and Israel were at least three months after the HCT procedure (median: 236 days) and had low blood counts in at least one blood cell lineage. They were assigned to one of three treatment arms: one million cells/kg, two million cells/kg or four million cells/kg. Each patient received two treatments of the assigned dose.



Data from the six-month follow-up were available for 14 of the 21 treated patients and demonstrated that (i) PLX-R18 was well-tolerated with a favorable safety profile; (ii) statistically significant improvement from baseline counts was observed in all cohorts for hemoglobin and platelet counts (p<0.05) and the patients in the high dose arm (4 million cells/kg) exhibited statistically significant improvements in all three blood cell lineages (p<0.01); (iii) approximately 60% of patients exhibited improvements in all three blood cell lineages: hemoglobin, neutrophil and platelet counts that are above the initial criteria for inclusion in the study and (iv) 13 patients were transfusion dependent at baseline; six of those became transfusion independent at 6 month follow-up and no patients who were transfusion independent at baseline became transfusion dependent.



Peripheral and Cardiovascular Diseases. We investigated the use of PLX-PAD cells for the treatment of peripheral arterial disease, or PAD, including IC and CLI.





3







We completed two Phase I safety/dose-escalating clinical studies for CLI, one in the United States and one in Germany. These CLI studies demonstrated that no blood type or human leukocyte antigen matching is required, and that the administration of PLX-PAD cells is safe, even if two doses are administered to a patient on two different occasions.



We conducted a pivotal Phase III study of PLX-PAD cells in the treatment of CLI for patients with minor tissue loss (Rutherford Category 5) who are unsuitable for revascularization. This multinational Phase III study was conducted in the United States, Europe and Israel and enrolled 213 patients in total.



In December 2020, the independent Data Monitoring Committee, or DMC, issued its recommendation letter following an interim analysis relating to the CLI Phase III study. A clinical dataset was reviewed by the independent DMC for safety and analysis of the primary endpoint of amputation-free survival, defined as time to occurrence of major amputation of the index leg or death. Based on the review, the DMC concluded that the CLI study was unlikely to meet the primary endpoint by the time of the final analysis. Following the DMC’s recommendation, we decided to terminate the CLI study.



ARS. We have conducted several animal studies for the evaluation of PLX-R18 for the treatment of ARS, in collaboration with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, or the NIAID. The NIH, funded and conducted a pilot study in non-human primates, or NHPs, to evaluate the therapeutic effect of PLX-R18 on hematological aspects of ARS. In 2017, we announced results of the NHPs pilot study for PLX-R18 as a treatment for ARS. Although study size was not designed to show significance, results showed a trend toward improved survival of PLX-R18 treated animals compared to control, placebo treated animals. The study, conducted and funded by the NIAID, was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of PLX-R18 following IM injection into irradiated and non-irradiated NHPs. Efficacy measures included survival as well as hematological parameters which are affected by exposure to high levels of radiation as may occur in a nuclear accident or attack. These data will help the design of a pivotal study to fulfill the requirements for a Biologics License Application, or BLA, submission under the FDA’s Animal Rule regulatory pathway. 



We plan to continue the discussions with the different government agencies with the goal of receiving their support for pivotal studies in NHPs as well as conducting the safety studies required in order to file BLA for this indication.



In October 2017, we announced that the FDA granted us an orphan drug designation for our PLX-R18 cell therapy for the prevention and treatment of ARS.



In April 2018, we announced that the FDA approved our IND application for PLX-R18 cell therapy in the treatment of ARS. The IND allows us to treat victims who may have been acutely exposed to high dose radiation due to nuclear attack or accident.



In December 2015, we also signed a memorandum of understanding, or MOU, for a collaboration with Fukushima Medical University, Fukushima Global Medical Science Center. The purpose of the collaboration is to develop our PLX-R18 cells for the treatment of ARS, and for morbidities following radiotherapy in cancer patients. In June 2018, we reported positive animal data from studies conducted in collaboration with Fukushima Medical University evaluating PLX-R18 cells as a treatment for radiation damage to the gastrointestinal, or GI, tract and bone marrow. Data from these studies showed that PLX-R18 cells significantly increased survival rates, preserved GI stem cells activity that enhance the recovery of the GI system and prevented severe damage to the intestinal lining, suggesting PLX-R18 potential as a multi-organ therapy for ARS.



In July 2019, we presented positive results from a series of studies of our PLX-R18 cell therapy product conducted by the DoD, Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute, part of the Uniformed Services University of Health Sciences. The studies were designed to evaluate PLX-R18 as a potential prophylactic countermeasure against ARS administered prior to radiation exposure. These animal studies demonstrate that PLX-R18, administered 24 hours before radiation exposure, and again 72 hours after exposure, resulted in a significant increase in survival rates, from 4% survival rate in the placebo group to 74% in the treated group. In addition, the data shows an increase in recovery of blood lineages and a favorable safety profile. Furthermore, histopathological analysis and hematopoietic progenitor clonogenic assay of tissues collected show a significant increase in bone marrow cell numbers and improved regenerative capability into all blood lineages.


Steroid-Refractory cGVHD. In September 2017, we signed an agreement with Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center (Ichilov Hospital) to conduct a Phase I/II clinical study of PLX-PAD cell therapy for the treatment of Steroid-Refractory cGVHD. This study is an investigator-initiated study. As such, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center supports the study and is responsible for its design and implementation.

Regulatory and Clinical Affairs Strategy 



Our cell therapy development strategy is to hold open and frequent discussions with regulators at all stages of development from preclinical studies to more advanced regulatory stages. We utilize this strategy in working with the FDA, the EMA, Germany’s PEI as well as other European national competent authorities, the MOH, Japan’s Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency, or PMDA, and also the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, or MFDS, of South Korea.
Intellectual Property



We understand that our success will depend, in part, on maintaining our intellectual property, and therefore we are committed to protecting our technology and product candidates with patents and other methods described below.



We are the sole owner of 133 issued patents and approximately 70 pending patent applications in the United States, Europe, China, Japan and Israel, as well as in additional countries worldwide, including countries in the Far East and South America (in calculating the number of issued patents, each European patent validated in multiple jurisdictions was counted as a single patent).



In April 2016, the Israeli subsidiary entered into a licensing agreement with TES Holdings Co., Ltd., a venture company derived from the University of Tokyo, to obtain a key patent in Japan to cover the treatment of ischemic diseases with placental cell therapy. This license is subject to future single low-digit royalties from sales of our product for treatment in the field of ischemic diseases in Japan, until expiry of the patent in 2023. This license is in addition to the grant of 13 patents to us by the Japanese Patent Office, which address three dimensional methods for expanding placental and adipose cells, and specified cell therapies produced from placental tissue using these methods and bedside thawing devices.



In February 2017, the Israeli Subsidiary signed an agreement with founders of a certain patent for a five-year option to purchase a certain patent for an amount of €1 million. The agreement includes yearly payments of €75,000, €75,000 and €100,000 in February 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively, which have been paid. We are entitled to terminate the agreement for convenience upon providing the founders 30 days prior notice.



In April 2019, we filed a U.S. provisional patent application titled “Methods and Compositions for Producing Cannabinoids,” which covers the use of our state-of-the-art, proprietary 3D cell culturing technology for the potential manufacturing of cannabinoid-producing cells. In April 2020, we filed a Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, application with respect to the technology. In June 2021, national or regional phase applications of the PCT were filed in the United States, Europe, Japan, Canada, and Israel.



In March 2020, we filed a U.S. provisional patent application titled “Methods and Compositions for Treating Viral Infections and Sequelae Thereof,” which covers the use of placental adherent stromal cells for treating coronavirus infections and sequelae thereof. In May 2020, a related Israeli patent application was filed, which was allowed in March 2021. In March 2021, a PCT application as well as national applications were filed in the United States and Israel. In June 2021, national or regional phase applications of the PCT were filed in Europe and Mexico. 



Based on the well-established understanding that the characteristics and therapeutic potential of a cell product are largely determined by the source of the cells and by the methods and conditions used during their culturing, our patent portfolio includes different types of claims that protect the various unique aspects of our technology.



Our multi-national portfolio of patent and patent applications includes the following claims:




● | our proprietary expansion methods for 3D stromal cells;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


● | composition of matter claims covering the cells;
--+-------------------------------------------------


● | the therapeutic use of PLX cells for the treatment of a variety of medical conditions; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | cell-culture, harvest, and thawing devices.
--+--------------------------------------------

Through our experience with adherent stromal cell based product development, we have developed expertise and know-how in this field and have established procedures for manufacturing clinical-grade PLX cells in our facilities. Certain aspects of our manufacturing process are covered by patents and patent applications. In addition, specific aspects of our technology are retained as know-how and trade secrets that are protected by our confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, contractors, manufacturers and advisors. These agreements generally provide for protection of confidential information, restrictions on the use of materials, and an obligation to assign to us inventions conceived during the course of performing services for us.



The following table sets forth our key patents and patent applications and is not intended to represent an assessment of claims, limitations or scope. In some cases, a jurisdiction is listed as both pending and granted for a single patent family. This is due to pending continuation or divisional applications of the granted case.



The expiration dates of these patents, based on filing dates, range from 2027 to 2041. Actual expiration dates will be determined according to extensions received based on the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (P.L. 98-417), commonly known as the “Hatch-Waxman” Act, that permits extensions of pharmaceutical patents to reflect regulatory delays encountered in obtaining FDA market approval. The Hatch-Waxman Act is based on a U.S. federal law and therefore only relevant to U.S. patents.



There is a risk that our patents will be invalidated, and that our pending patent applications will not result in issued patents. We also cannot be certain that we will not infringe on any patents that may be issued to others. See “Risk Factors - We must further protect and develop our technology and products in order to become a profitable company.”

Research and Development 



Foundational Research



Our initial technology, the PluriX™ Bioreactor system, was invented at the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology’s Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, in collaboration with researchers from the Weizmann Institute of Science. This technology was acquired by us and has been further significantly developed by our research and development teams over the ensuing years.
Collaborations and Ongoing Research and Development Plans



Charité Agreement



In July 2007, we entered into a five-year collaborative research agreement with the Berlin-Brandenburg Center for Regenerative Therapies at Charité – University Medicine Berlin, or Charité, which was extended from time to time through June 2022. We and Charité are collaborating on a variety of indications utilizing PLX cells. According to the agreement, we will be the exclusive owner of the technology and any products produced as a result of the collaboration. Charité will receive between 1% to 2% royalties from net sales of new developments that have been achieved during the joint development.
Fukushima Medical University



We signed an MOU for a collaboration with Fukushima Medical University, Fukushima Global Medical Science Center. The purpose of the collaboration is to develop Pluristem’s PLX-R18 cells for the treatment of ARS, and for morbidities following radiotherapy in cancer patients. The collaboration will proceed alongside research supported by the NIH, which is studying PLX-R18 as a potential treatment for the hematologic component of ARS. The MOU for a collaboration with Fukushima will be renewed automatically on a yearly basis. Each party is entitled to terminate the agreement for convenience upon providing the other party 30 days prior notice.



CHA Agreement



On June 26, 2013, we entered into an exclusive out-licensing and commercialization agreement, or the CHA Agreement, with CHA for conducting clinical studies and commercialization of our PLX-PAD product candidate in South Korea in connection with two indications: the treatment of CLI and IC. We will continue to retain rights to our proprietary manufacturing technology and cell-related intellectual property.



The first clinical study that was performed as part of the CHA Agreement was a Phase II study in IC. Upon the first regulatory approval for a PLX product in South Korea, if granted, for the specified indications, we and CHA will establish an equally owned joint venture with the purpose of commercializing PLX cell products in South Korea. Additionally, we will be able to use the data generated by CHA to pursue the development of PLX product candidates outside of South Korea.



The term of the CHA Agreement extends from June 24, 2013 until the later of the expiration, lapse, cancellation, abandonment or invalidation of the last valid patent claim covering the development of the product indications. The CHA Agreement contains customary termination provisions, including in the event that the parties do not reach an agreement upon a development plan for conducting the clinical studies.



Upon termination of the CHA Agreement, the license granted thereunder will terminate, and all rights included therein will revert to us, whereupon we will be free to enter into agreements with any other third parties for the granting of a license in or outside South Korea or to deal in any other manner with such rights as it shall see fit in our sole discretion.

United Arab Emirates-based Abu Dhabi Stem Cells Center



In August 2020, we signed a non-binding MOU with the United Arab Emirates-based Abu Dhabi Stem Cells Center, a specialist healthcare center focused on cell therapy and regenerative medicine. The aim of the collaboration is to capitalize on each party’s respective areas of expertise in cell therapies. The parties have agreed to exchange research results, share samples, join usage of equipment and testing, and other essential activities related to advancing the treatment and research of cell therapies for a broad range of medical conditions, including COVID-19.



We plan to continue to collaborate with universities, academic institutions, and corporate partners worldwide to fully leverage our expertise and explore the use of our cells in other indications.



In-House Clinical Manufacturing



We have the in-house capability to perform clinical cell manufacturing. Our state-of-the-art Good Manufacturing Practice, or GMP, grade manufacturing facility in Haifa has been in use since February 2013 for the main purpose of clinical grade, large-scale manufacturing. The facility’s new automated manufacturing process and products were approved for production of PLX-PAD for clinical use by the FDA, EMA, MFDS, PMDA and the MOH. Our second product, PLX-R18, was cleared by the FDA and the MOH for clinical use. Furthermore, the site was inspected and approved by an European Union qualified person (European accreditation body), approving that the site and production processes meet the current GMP for the purpose of manufacturing clinical grade products.



The site was also inspected and approved by the MOH and we received a cGMP Certification and manufacturer-importer authorization.



We obtain the human placentas used for our research and manufacturing activities from various hospitals in Israel after receiving a written informed consent by the mother and pathogen clearance. Any medical waste related to the use of placentas is treated in compliance with local environmental laws and standards.



In June 2019, we announced that we developed a serum-free formulation to support the manufacturing of cell therapy products. This serum-free formulation was developed using our deep understanding in cell therapy industrial scale production standards, and the quality methods designed to support implementation in Phase III development and marketing. Achieving this significant technological challenge is expected to provide us with large-scale, highly consistent production capacity with operational independency from third party suppliers for standard serum, an expensive and quantity limited product. PLX-R18 is the first product candidate manufactured using the serum-free media.



Government Regulation 



The development, manufacturing, and future marketing of our cell therapy product candidates are subject to the laws and regulations of governmental authorities in the United States, Europe and Israel, as well as other countries in which our products may be marketed in the future like Japan, and South Korea. In addition, the manufacturing conditions are specifically inspected by the MOH.



The FDA and the EMA must approve products prior to marketing. Furthermore, various governmental statutes and regulations also govern or influence testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage and record keeping related to such products and their marketing. Governments in other countries have similar requirements for testing and marketing.



The process of obtaining these approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time, resources and money. There can be no assurance that our product candidates will ultimately receive marketing approval, or, if approved, will be reimbursed by public and private health insurance.



There are several stages every drug undergoes during its development process. Among these are:




● | Performance of nonclinical laboratory and animal studies to assess a drug’s biological activity and to identify potential safety concerns, and to characterize and document the product’s chemistry, manufacturing controls, formulation, and stability. In accordance with regulatory requirements, nonclinical safety and toxicity studies are conducted under Good Laboratory Practice, requirements to ensure their quality and reliability;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The manufacture of the product according to GMP regulations and standards;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Conducting adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies in compliance with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for its intended indication; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------






11








● | Potential post-marketing clinical testing and surveillance of the product after marketing approval, which can result in additional conditions on the approvals or suspension of clinical use.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Approval of a drug for clinical studies in humans and approval of marketing are sovereign decisions of states, made by national, or, in case of the European Union, international regulatory competent authorities.



The Regulatory Process in the United States



In the United States, our product candidates are subject to regulation as a biological product under the Public Health Service Act and the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The FDA, regulating the approval of clinical studies and marketing applications in the United States, generally requires the following steps prior to approving a new biological product for use either for clinical studies or for commercial sale:




● | Submission of an IND Application, which must become effective before clinical testing in humans can begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Obtaining approval of Institutional Review Boards, or IRBs, of research institutions or other clinical sites to introduce the drug candidate into humans in clinical studies;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA may grant approval for EAP prior to the completion of clinical studies, in order to allow access for the investigational drug, for patients that are excluded from the study;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA may grant priority review status to expedite the BLA review process. Obtaining a Fast Track designation allows access for the request of priority review;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Submission of a BLA for marketing authorization of the product, which must include adequate results of pre-clinical testing and clinical studies;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Submission of BLA with a proof of efficacy that is based only on animal studies is feasible in instances where human efficacy studies cannot be conducted because the conduct of such studies is unethical and field studies after an accidental or deliberate exposure are not feasible;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review of the BLA in order to determine, among other things, whether the product is safe and effective for its intended uses; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA inspection and approval of the product manufacturing facility at which the product will be manufactured.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Regulatory Process in Europe



In the European Union, our investigational cellular products are regulated under the Advanced Therapy Medicinal Product regulation, a regulation specific to cell and tissue products. This European Union regulation requires:

● | Filing a Clinical Trial Application for each European country involved in the clinical study. The application may be filed via a centralized procedure, which makes it possible to obtain a coordinated assessment of an application for a clinical study that is to take place in several European countries;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Obtaining approval of affiliated ethics committees to test the investigational product into humans in clinical studies;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Adequate and well-controlled clinical studies to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for its intended use; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Since our investigational cellular products are regulated under the Advanced Therapy Medicinal Product regulation, the application for marketing authorization to the EMA is mandatory within the 28 member states of the European Union. The EMA is expected to review and approve the MAA.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




In May 2015, we were selected by the EMA for development of PLX-PAD cells via the EMA Adaptive Pathways Project.

Other Regulations



In general, the approval procedure varies among countries, and may involve additional preclinical testing and clinical studies. The requirements and time required may differ from those required for FDA or EMA approval. Each country may impose certain procedures and requirements of its own. Most countries other than the United States, the European Union and Japan are willing to consider requests for marketing approval only after the product had been approved for marketing by either the FDA, the EMA or the PMDA. The decision regarding marketing approval is made following the submission of a dossier that is thoroughly assessed and critically addressed.



In Japan, we have completed the required regulatory interactions with the PMDA, prior to the submission of clinical study notification, in the framework of the new regulations for regenerative therapy effective in November 2014, which promote expedited approval for regenerative therapies that are being developed for seriously debilitating/life-threatening indications.



Clinical Studies



Typically, in the United States, as well as in the European Union, clinical development involves a three-phase process, although the phases may overlap. Phase I, clinical studies are conducted in a small number of healthy volunteers, or patients in cases of ethical issues with using healthy volunteers and are designed to provide information about product safety and to evaluate the pattern of drug distribution and metabolism within the body.



Phase II clinical studies are conducted with a homogenous group of patients afflicted with the specific target disease, to explore preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and confirm the safety profile. In some cases, an initial study is conducted in patients to assess both preliminary efficacy and preliminary safety and patterns of drug metabolism and distribution, in which case it is referred to as a Phase I/II study. Phase III clinical studies are generally large-scale, multi-center, controlled studies conducted with a heterogeneous group of patients afflicted with the target disease, aiming to provide statistically significant support of efficacy, as well as safety and potency. The Phase III studies are considered confirmatory for establishing the efficacy and safety profile of the drug and are critical for approval. In some circumstances, a regulatory agency may require Phase IV, or post-marketing studies in case additional information needs to be collected after the drug is on the market.



During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data and clinical study sites investigators to minimize risks and ensure high quality and integrity of the collected data. The sponsor of a clinical study is required to submit an annual safety report to the relevant regulatory agencies, in which serious adverse events are reported, and also to submit in an expedited manner any individual serious adverse events that are suspected to be related to the tested drug and are unexpected with its use. An agency may, at its discretion, re-evaluate, alter, suspend, or terminate the clinical study based upon the data that have been accumulated to that point and its assessment of the risk/benefit ratio to the patient.



Employees



As of June 30, 2021, we employed a total of 153 full-time employees and nine part-time employees, of whom, 129 full-time employees and nine part-time employees are engaged in research and development, manufacturing and clinical development.
Competition 



The regenerative medicine field is characterized by intense competition, as global and local pharma players are becoming more engaged in the cell therapy field based on the advancements made in clinical studies and due to the new favorable regenerative medicine legislation in certain regions. We face competition from both allogeneic and autologous cell therapy companies, academic, commercial and research institutions, pharmaceutical companies, biopharmaceutical companies, and governmental agencies. Some of the clinical indications we currently have under development are also being investigated in preclinical and clinical programs by others.



While there are hundreds of companies in the regenerative medicine space globally, there are multiple participants in the cell therapy field based in the United States, Europe, Japan, Korea, and Australia such as Athersys Inc., Celularity Inc., Tigenix NV (acquired by Takeda), SanBio Inc. and Mesoblast Ltd. Among other things, we expect to compete based upon our intellectual property portfolio, our in-house manufacturing efficiencies and capabilities, and the efficacy of our products. Our ability to compete successfully will depend on our continued ability to attract and retain experienced and skilled executives, scientific and clinical development personnel, to identify and develop viable cellular therapeutic candidates, and exploit these products commercially. Given the magnitude of the potential opportunity for cell therapy, we expect competition in this area to intensify.

Impact of COVID-19



In managing our ongoing global clinical studies, as well as our daily operations, in the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic, we are taking all necessary precautions for the safety and well-being of patients, healthcare providers involved in our studies, and our employees. We are continuing our operational and manufacturing activities, subject to the directives of the MOH, with a dedicated team on site at our facilities. In addition, the majority of our employees have been vaccinated and we are using remote work technologies that enable the mitigation of office staff while allowing other activities to be conducted without the need for a physical presence in our facilities. The COVID-19 global pandemic caused delays in enrollment of some of our clinical studies. Despite these impacts, we currently hold supplies of PLX cells in inventory in Israel, and in secure storage facilities in Europe and the U.S. In addition, we are following the FDA and EMA guidelines regarding the management of clinical studies during COVID-19. However, the impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic is constantly evolving, and we may experience further impacts on our daily operations, including the need for employees to potentially self-isolate based on potential exposure to the virus, difficulties for our employees in travelling abroad, and delays in our clinical trials and our ongoing research work with various hospitals and academic institutions.
