Item 1. Business
Our Company
ARC Document Solutions, Inc. (“ARC Document Solutions,” “ARC,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) provides a wide variety of document distribution and graphic production services to facilitate communication for professionals in the design, marketing, commercial real estate, education, construction and related fields.
Our customers need us to manage the special production needs, volume, complexity and workflow of their documents. We help them reduce their costs and increase their efficiency by improving their access and control over documents, and we offer a wide variety of ways to access, distribute, collaborate on, and store documents.
Our offerings include:
Offsite Services - We operate 148 offsite service centers in major metropolitan markets in the U.S. and internationally which provide local customers with high-volume, project-related printing, offer our MPS customers overflow capacity during peak workloads, and support our customers’ scanning needs in archiving and information management services.
Specialized Color Printing - Our service centers offer color printing, finishing, and assembly of graphic materials for regional and national retailers, schools, franchises, marketing departments, theme parks, and cultural institutions, as well as a growing need for public health and safety graphics related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Managed Print Services (“MPS”) - An onsite service where we place, manage, and optimize print and imaging equipment in our customers' offices, job sites, and other facilities. MPS relieves our customers of the burden of owning and managing print devices and print networks, and shifts their costs to a “per-use” basis typically billed in a single consolidated invoice.
Archive and Information Management (“AIM”) -We store our customers' information and intellectual property in a highly secure cloud-based and searchable digital archive. We scan our customers’ paper documents or import their digital documents, organize them, and store them in our proprietary content management software. Our regional scanning centers are HIPPA-compliant and we are fully capable of handling protected health information in addition to conventional business documents.
Web-Based Document Management Applications - We develop and offer proprietary tools to our customers, such as SKYSITE®, Abacus®, and the ARC Print app that facilitate project collaboration, manage print networks, track equipment fleets, create and maintain project document archives, and perform other document and content management tasks.
Equipment and Supplies Sales - We sell equipment and supplies primarily to customers in the architectural, engineering, construction, and building owner/operator (AEC/O) industry and provide ancillary services such as equipment service and maintenance.
The combination of our services allows us to provide a comprehensive document management ecosystem where any document, anywhere in the enterprise, can be captured, stored, managed, accessed, and distributed anywhere in the world.
Our cloud-based services are hosted by Amazon Web Services. 
We believe we are the largest document solutions provider to the AEC/O market in North America, and the only national provider offering onsite, offsite and cloud-based document management solutions for regional, national and global customers. We offer comprehensive services across geographical boundaries and frequently bill under a single monthly invoice, consolidating purchasing, vendor relations, and administration for companies seeking a unified document management platform.
We serve our clients' onsite in their offices in approximately 10,750 locations, and offsite or virtually through a combination of 148 global service centers, a variety of web-based applications and software, and a global network of service partners. We operate in major metropolitan markets across the U.S., with meaningful operations in China, Canada, and the United Kingdom.
Our origins lie in the reprographics, or “blueprinting,” industry and we still maintain robust reprographics operations. We believe that we are the largest reprographics company in the United States as measured by revenue, number of customers, and number of service centers.
Our base of more than 45,000 customers includes most of the largest design and construction-oriented firms in North America, and the world, and our expansion into new markets includes some of the biggest names in retail, technology, educational, hospitality, public utilities customers, and others. 
Our largest customers are served by our corporate sales force called Global Solutions. This sales force is focused on large regional and national customers. Our diverse customer base results in no individual customer accounting for more than 2% of our overall revenue.
We are a Delaware corporation operating under a single brand, “ARC”. Our corporate name is “ARC Document Solutions, Inc.,” and our New York Stock Exchange ticker symbol is “ARC.” We conduct our operations through our wholly-owned subsidiary, ARC Document Solutions, LLC, a Texas limited liability company, and its affiliates.
Principal Products and Services
We report revenues from our service and product offerings under the following categories:
Construction Document and Information Management (CDIM), which consists of professional services to manage and distribute documents and information related to construction projects and related project-based businesses outside of the architectural, engineering and construction (AEC) industry. Our reconfiguration of the Company's sales and marketing functions in late-2019, as well as customer needs driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, have led to a significant expansion of the non-AEC segment of our CDIM business, primarily through the provision of color graphics and signage. CDIM sales also include software services such as SKYSITE®, our cloud-based project communication application, as well as providing document and information management services that are often technology-enabled. The bulk of our current revenue from CDIM comes from large-format and small-format printing services we provide in both black and white and in color.
Managed Print Services (MPS), which consists of placement, management, and optimization of print and imaging equipment in our customers' offices, job sites, and other facilities. MPS relieves our customers of the burden of owning and managing print devices and print networks, and shifts their costs to a “per-use” basis. MPS is supported by our proprietary technology, Abacus, which allows our customers to capture, control, manage, print, and account for their documents. MPS sales represent recurring, contracted revenue in which we are paid a single cost per unit of material used, often referred to as a “click charge.” MPS sales are driven by the ongoing print needs of our customers at their facilities. Because the recent pandemic has forced a large number of our clients to direct their employees to work from home, MPS volume and sales have declined over the past year.
Archiving and Information Management (AIM), which consists of software and professional services to facilitate the capture, management, access and retrieval of documents and information that have been produced in the past. AIM includes our SKYSITE software application to organize, search and retrieve documents, as well as the provision of services that include the capture and conversion of hardcopy and electronic documents, and their cloud-based storage and maintenance. A growing portion of our sales are being driven by our ability to handle protected health information (PHI) as our regional scanning centers are HIPAA-compliant. AIM sales are driven by the need to leverage past intellectual property for present or future use, facilitate cost savings and efficiency improvements over current hardcopy and digital storage methods, as well as comply with regulatory and records retention requirements. Remote access to digital documents driven by work-from-home conditions created by the recent pandemic have also contributed to new activity in this area of our business. 
Equipment and Supplies, which consists of reselling printing, imaging, and related equipment to customers primarily to architectural, engineering and construction firms.
Each of our service offerings is enabled through a suite of supporting proprietary technology. 
Operations
Our products and services are available from any of our 148 service centers around the world, and nearly all of our services can be made available in our customers’ offices. Our geographic presence is concentrated in the U.S., with additional service centers in Canada, China, India, and the United Kingdom. Our corporate headquarters are located in San Ramon, California.
Historically, our business grew through acquisitions to expand our share of the reprographics market and enhance our geographic footprint to serve our larger customers. Since our inception we have acquired more than 140 companies. As we have consolidated, diversified our service offerings, and optimized our operations during the past several years, we are no longer actively pursuing the acquisition of reprographic businesses. Our origin as a company was in California, and our early acquisition activity was concentrated there. We derive approximately 32% of our total revenue from California.
We currently employ approximately 15 engineers working from our corporate headquarters in San Ramon, California, who develop, maintain, and support our software. In addition, we operate a technology center in Kolkata, India, with approximately 160 employees who, in addition to supporting our San Ramon team, also support our research and development efforts. All of our production facilities are connected via a high-performance, dedicated, wide-area network, to facilitate data transmissions to and from our customers, our operating facilities and the cloud hosted by Amazon Web Services. We employ a combination of proprietary and industry-leading technologies to provide redundancy, backup and security of all data in our systems. In response to the recent pandemic, most of our corporate, financial and administrative staff have been working from home, while our service center staff continue to work in our facilities and adhere to strict safety and health protocols.
The majority of our historical revenue has been derived from customers engaged in the seasonal, non-residential construction market. While our traditional reprographics business, which is included in the CDIM revenue category, is still influenced by the non-residential seasonality and building cycles, our other CDIM offerings are less so. Historically, color printing services are affected by retail marketing calendars, advertising campaigns, as well as the marketing needs of our architectural and real estate development clients. Our software services are influenced primarily by the desire for document workflow improvements and our ability to market our technology-based solutions. MPS is driven by the generation of office documents and our customers' desire to improve business processes and reduce print-related costs. Equipment and Supplies Sales are driven by purchasing cycles of individual customers, as well as by new features and advancements by manufacturers.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company employed approximately 1,750 employees.
Our Customers and Markets
We serve both the enterprise and project management needs of professionals in the design, marketing, commercial real estate, construction and related fields. Our customers include senior management teams, IT and procurement departments, project architects, engineers, general contractors, facilities managers, marketing managers, as well as growing number of retail, technology, educational, hospitality, and public utilities customers.
We believe the market forces of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to cause our customers to emphasize efficiency in the production and distribution of printed documents, responsibly reduce their dependence on print where it is not necessary, and to improve remote access and control over all the documents related to their business. We believe the pandemic also encourages our customers to actively reduce costs, eliminate redundant business practices, and procure products and services from vendors who can centrally serve their business – including a remote workforce working from home – with a comprehensive offering.
We believe that these trends are advantageous to us because we can provide our customers with web-based applications and cloud-based offerings to meet their demand for technology-enabled content management services; we offer a wide variety of digital and conventional alternatives to standard printing; and our comprehensive services and national footprint create economies of scale and efficiencies for customers who prefer to work with a single supplier for print and document management. 
In addition to the AEC/O industry, we also provide document management and printing services to customers in the retail, technology, educational, hospitality, and public utilities customers, among others. A significant portion of our non-AEC/O revenues are derived from supplying color printing services to customers with short-run, high quality, frequently updated promotional, advertising, marketing and public health materials. We market these services under a separate brand known as Riot Creative Imaging. Likewise, our digital tools and services appeal to companies outside of the construction industry, but with similar document management needs, including manufacturers, airlines, and healthcare/hospital companies.
In general, we address customers based on size and geographic reach. Local markets tend to be highly fragmented with a wide variety of specialized, geographically differentiated business practices. We serve smaller customers in these markets with service offerings aligned with local market expectations. Larger regional, national and international customers often consolidate purchasing and the acquisition of services through a single corporate department, and seek centralized management of document solutions. We serve these customers through our corporate sales force called Global Solutions.
Competition
The level of competition varies in each of the areas in which we provide services. We believe service levels, breadth of offering, price, quality, responsiveness, and convenience to the customer are competitive elements in each of the industry segments in which we compete.
Further, we believe we are unique because no other company provides the complete portfolio of services and products we provide. We compete with different firms in our different business lines that can provide a portion of our services. However, we do not know of any other firm that can provide a full suite of physical and digital content management services similar to our combined offerings. 
In addressing larger local and regional customers, there are several companies that provide MPS and reprographic print services, but in general, we believe that these companies cannot provide or integrate software or technology that enables the digital management of documents and centralized cost control management that we provide. In our CDIM offerings, local copy shops and self-serve franchises are often aggressive competitors for printing business, but rarely offer the breadth of document management and logistics services that we do.
With regard to large national and international customers, there are no other document solutions companies in the U.S. with the national presence and global reach that we have established, but we often compete against equipment manufacturers and businesses who offer some of the same products and services we do. Related services are offered by large printing/multifunctional device manufacturers such as Xerox, Canon, Hewlett Packard, Konica Minolta, Ricoh, and Sharp, but most offerings from these companies are focused on selling equipment as opposed to ARC’s offering of comprehensive document management services for both project and enterprise documents. Further, our deep knowledge of the AEC/O industry document workflows, which are incorporated into our software, provides us an advantage when competing against local printers and national equipment manufacturers.
We believe that we have a strong competitive position in the marketplace for the following reasons:
Strong domain expertise in construction-related fields: We believe no other national vendor/service provider possesses the document management and technology expertise that we have in the AEC/O market. Construction professionals have highly specialized needs in document capture, short-term storage, management, fulfillment, distribution, and archival services. We believe our domain expertise is unmatched due to our legacy in reprographics and software development.
Customer relationships in AEC/O industry: Our relationships with our local customers are often long-standing and comprehensive, and we do business with nearly all of the top 100 companies in the U.S. construction industry. In addition, our Global Solutions sales force has established long-term contract relationships with 25 of the largest 100 AEC/O firms. We believe this provides a competitive advantage by leveraging our success through referrals.
Wide-variety of specialized printing capabilities: We believe the equipment, capacity and expertise we offer throughout our service centers is unmatched by any other regional or national vendor. Customers with specialized printing needs can turn to us for design assistance, finishing and merchandising services, and interior and exterior installation, as well as printing services on virtually any material or object.
Service center footprint: We possess an extensive national network of service centers creating a distribution and customer service solution that can cater to both large and small customers. We operate service centers in more than 120 cities and in 34 states in the U.S. We also have a market presence in Canada and China, and operations in India and the U.K. We are not aware of any other MPS provider that has as extensive a network to supplement its MPS services and provide overflow and remote document management and printing capabilities.
Equipment agnostic: We are not required to sell or use any particular brands of equipment, nor do we manufacture equipment. We are free to place the products best suited for the required task in our own service centers or in our customers’ offices, regardless of manufacturer. Additionally, with respect to our MPS offering, as our customers' document management needs evolve over their respective contract terms, we have the ability to replace the equipment previously deployed to ensure that the equipment placed at our customers' sites is best suited for the required tasks. We believe that this, combined with the competitive market for printing and imaging products, provides us with an advantage relative to MPS providers owned by equipment manufacturers.
Capabilities in a wide variety of formats: Several equipment manufacturers who also market managed print services do not produce the full range of large- and small-format equipment demanded by the office market, AEC/O professionals, manufacturing companies, and building industries. In addition, we are not aware of any manufacturers that provide the breadth of services and technology related to large- and small-format document production that we possess.
Unique combination of Onsite, Offsite, and Cloud-based offerings: We believe we are the only national company that integrates (1) document production at customer sites (onsite offerings), (2) document production at company service centers (offsite offerings), and (3) digital management of documents in the cloud (cloud-based offerings). We have proprietary technology built by our development team that interacts with our production machines. We believe we are the only company that both develops document management software and manages the equipment that produces documents.
Suppliers and Vendors
We purchase or lease equipment for use in our production facilities and at our customers’ sites. We also purchase paper, toner and other consumables for the operation of our and our customers’ production equipment. As a high-volume purchaser, we believe we receive favorable prices as compared to other service providers, and price increases have been historically passed on to customers.
Our primary vendors of equipment, maintenance services, and reprographics supplies include Hewlett Packard, Canon Solutions America (Océ), and Xerox. Purchases from these vendors during 2020 comprised approximately 53% of our total purchases of inventory and supplies. Although there are a limited number of suppliers that could supply our inventory, we believe any shortfalls from existing suppliers could be filled by other suppliers on comparable terms. 
Proprietary Rights
We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, license agreements, nondisclosure and non-competition agreements, reseller agreements, customer contracts, and technical measures to establish and protect our rights in our proprietary technology. We also rely on a variety of technologies that are licensed from third parties to perform key functions.
We have registered “ARC Document Solutions,” as well as our historical name and logo, “ARC American Reprographics Company,” as trademarks in the U.S. with the United States Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO"). We have registered “PlanWell”, “PlanWell PDS”, “Riot Creative Imaging”, “ABACUS” and "SKYSITE” as trademarks with the USPTO and in other countries. We do not own any other registered trademarks or service marks, or any patents, that are material to our business.
For a discussion of the risks associated with our proprietary rights, see Item 1A — “Risk Factors — Our failure to adequately protect the proprietary aspects of our technology, including SKYSITE, PlanWell, and Abacus, may cause us to lose market share.”
