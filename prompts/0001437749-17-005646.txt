ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, when we use the terms the “Company,” “Clipper Realty,” “we,” “us,” or “our,” unless the context otherwise requires, we are referring to Clipper Equity Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. Certain disclosures included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K constitute forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. See Item 1A, "Risk Factors," and “Cautionary Note Concerning Forward-Looking Statements."
 
Overview
 
Clipper Realty Inc. (the “Company,’ “we,” or “us”) is a self-administered and self-managed real estate company that acquires, owns, manages, operates and repositions multi-family residential and commercial properties in the New York metropolitan area, with an initial portfolio in Manhattan and Brooklyn. The Company was formed to continue and expand the commercial real estate business of the 50/53 JV LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, Renaissance Equity Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, Berkshire Equity LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and Gunki Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (collectively, the “Predecessor” or the “predecessor entities”). Our primary focus is to continue to own, manage and operate our initial portfolio and to acquire and reposition additional multi-family residential and commercial properties in the New York metropolitan area.
 
We were incorporated on July 7, 2015. On August 3, 2015, we closed a private offering of shares of our common stock, in which we raised net proceeds of approximately $130.2 million. In connection with the private offering, we consummated a series of investment and other formation transactions that were designed, among other things, to enable us to qualify as a real estate investment trust (a “REIT”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes and we have elected to be treated as a REIT commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2015.
 
On February 9, 2017, the Company closed an initial public offering of 6,390,149 shares of its common stock (including the exercise in full of the over-allotment option, which closed on March 10, 2017) at a price of $13.50 per share (the “IPO”). The net proceeds of the IPO were approximately $78.2 million. We contributed the proceeds of the IPO to Clipper Realty L.P., our operating partnership subsidiary (the “Operating Partnership”), in exchange for units in the Operating Partnership.
 
The Company’s initial portfolio of properties consists of:
 

● | two neighboring residential/retail rental properties at 50 Murray Street and 53 Park Place in the Tribeca neighborhood of Manhattan, which we collectively refer to as the Tribeca House properties;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | one residential property complex in the East Flatbush neighborhood of Brooklyn consisting of 59 buildings, which we refer to as the Flatbush Gardens properties or complex;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | two primarily commercial properties in Downtown Brooklyn (one of which includes 36 residential apartment units), which we refer to as the 141 Livingston Street property and the 250 Livingston Street property; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | one residential/retail rental property at 1955 1st Avenue in Manhattan, which we refer to as the Aspen property.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
These properties are located in the most densely populated major city in the United States, each with immediate access to mass transportation.

The Company’s ownership interest in its initial portfolio of properties were acquired in the formation transactions in connection with the private offering. These properties are owned by the predecessor entities, which after the formation transactions are referred to as the “LLC subsidiaries.” The LLC subsidiaries are managed by the Company through the Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership’s interest in the LLC subsidiaries generally entitles the Operating Partnership to all cash distributions from, and the profits and losses of, the LLC subsidiaries other than the preferred distribution to the continuing investors who hold class B LLC units in these LLC subsidiaries described below. In connection with the formation transactions, holders of interests in the predecessor entities received Class B LLC units in the Operating Partnership or shares of our common stock. At December 31, 2016, the continuing investors owned an aggregate amount of 26,317,396 class B LLC units, representing 68.8% of the Company’s common stock on a fully diluted basis (59.0% immediately following the IPO). Accordingly, the Operating Partnership’s interests in the LLC subsidiaries entitled it to receive approximately 31.2% of the aggregate distributions from the LLC subsidiaries (41.0% immediately following the IPO). 
 
The Tribeca House properties were purchased in December 2014 and consist of two nearly adjacent properties in the Tribeca neighborhood of Manhattan, New York. They comprise approximately 480,000 square feet of leasable area with 505 residential apartment units with 11 foot ceilings and extensive amenities and approximately 77,200 square feet of retail space, including an externally managed garage. 
 
The Flatbush Gardens property complex was purchased in September 2005 and consists of 59 primarily six-story buildings, approximately 1.7 million square feet and 2,496 residential apartment units. The property is subject to rent control regulations of New York City which allow rents approximately 30% higher than existing rents for approximately 55% of the units. Since the acquisition in 2005, the management team has undertaken a comprehensive renovation and repositioning strategy that has included upgrades in the exterior and interior of the buildings. 
 
The 141 Livingston Street property in the Downtown Brooklyn neighborhood was purchased in 2002 along with the below-mentioned 250 Livingston Street property. It is a 15-story commercial building with a gross leasable area of 206,084 square feet. The property’s main commercial tenant, the City of New York, executed a new 10-year lease in December 2015, with effect as of June 2014. Under the agreement, the City of New York has an option to terminate the lease after five years in 2019 but will incur a rent increase of 25% if they renew.
 
The 250 Livingston Street property was purchased in 2002 along with the 141 Livingston Street property and consists of a 12-story commercial and residential building. It has approximately 267,000 square feet GLA of commercial space and approximately 26,800 square feet of residential space. The property’s sole office tenant, the City of New York, has leases expiring at the end 2020 as of January 1, 2017. The office space has been remeasured to 353,000 square feet according to REBNY standards.
 
The Aspen property, purchased on June 27, 2016, is located at 1955 1st Avenue, New York, NY. The property is a seven-story building which comprises 186,602 square feet, 232 residential rental units, three retail units and a parking garage. The residential units are subject to regulations established by the HDC under which there are no rental restrictions on approximately 55% of the units and low and middle income restrictions on approximately 45% of the units. 
 
In addition, in February 2017, the Company entered into an agreement to purchase a residential property located at 107 Columbia Heights in Brooklyn, NY for $87.5 million. The property comprises approximately 154,000 square feet, 161 residential units and an indoor parking garage. 
 
History
 
The Company’s Predecessor is a combination of four limited liability companies, Renaissance Equity Holdings LLC, Berkshire Equity LLC, Gunki Holdings LLC and 50/53 JV LLC, which were formed by principals of our management team from 2002 to 2014. Upon completion of the private offering and the formation transactions, we assumed responsibility for managing the predecessor LLCs.

● | Increase existing below-market rents by repositioning of our portfolio and utilize solid market fundamentals at several of our properties.

Regulation
 
Environmental and Related Matters
 
Under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, as a current or former owner and operator of real property, we may be liable for costs and damages resulting from the presence or release of hazardous substances (such as lead, asbestos and polychlorinated biphenyls), waste, petroleum products and other miscellaneous products (including but not limited to natural products such as methane and radon gas) at, on, in, under or from such property, including costs for investigation or remediation, natural resource damages, or third-party liability for personal injury or property damage. 
 
In addition, our properties are subject to various federal, state and local environmental and health and safety laws and regulations. As the owner or operator of real property, we may also incur liability based on various building conditions. We are not presently aware of any material liabilities related to building conditions, including any instances of material noncompliance with asbestos requirements or any material liabilities related to asbestos.
 
In addition, our properties may contain or develop harmful mold or suffer from other indoor air quality issues, which could lead to liability for adverse health effects or property damage or costs for remediation. We are not presently aware of any material adverse indoor air quality issues at our properties.
 
Americans with Disabilities Act and Similar Laws
 
Our properties must comply with Title III of the ADA to the extent that such properties are “public accommodations” as defined by the ADA. We have not conducted a recent audit or investigation of all of our properties to determine our compliance with these or other federal, state or local laws. Noncompliance with the ADA could result in imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. The obligation to make readily achievable accommodations is an ongoing one, and we will continue to assess our properties and to make alterations as appropriate in this respect.

Insurance
 
We carry commercial general liability insurance coverage on our properties, with limits of liability customary within the industry to insure against liability claims and related defense costs. Similarly, we are insured against the risk of direct and indirect physical damage to our properties including coverage for the perils of flood and earthquake shock. Our policies also cover the loss of rental revenue during any reconstruction period. Our policies reflect limits and deductibles customary in the industry and specific to the buildings and portfolio. We also obtain title insurance policies when acquiring new properties, which insure fee title to our real properties. We currently have coverage for losses incurred in connection with both domestic and foreign terrorist-related activities. While we do carry commercial general liability insurance, property insurance and terrorism insurance with respect to our properties, these policies include limits and terms we consider commercially reasonable. In addition, there are certain losses (including, but not limited to, losses arising from known environmental conditions or acts of war) that are not insured, in full or in part, because they are either uninsurable or the cost of insurance makes it, in our belief, economically impractical to maintain such coverage. Should an uninsured loss arise against us, we would be required to use our own funds to resolve the issue, including litigation costs. In addition, for properties we may self-insure certain portions of our insurance program, and therefore, use our own funds to satisfy those limits, when applicable. We believe the policy specifications and insured limits are adequate given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage and industry practice and, in the opinion of our management, the properties in our portfolio are adequately insured.
Competition
 
The leasing of real estate is highly competitive in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and the greater New York metropolitan market in which we operate. We compete with numerous acquirers, developers, owners and operators of commercial and residential real estate, many of which own or may seek to acquire or develop properties similar to ours in the same markets in which our properties are located. The principal means of competition are rent charged, location, services provided and the nature and condition of the facility to be leased.
 
In addition, we face competition from numerous commercial developers, real estate companies and other owners and operators of real estate for commercial buildings for acquisition and pursuing buyers for dispositions. We expect competition from other real estate investors, including other REITs, private real estate funds, domestic and foreign financial institutions, life insurance companies, pension trusts, partnerships, individual investors and others that may have greater financial resources or access to capital than we do or that are willing to acquire properties in transactions which are more highly leveraged or are less attractive from a financial viewpoint than we are willing to pursue.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 180 employees who provide property management, maintenance, landscaping, construction management and accounting services. Certain of these employees are covered by union-sponsored, collectively bargained, multiemployer defined benefit pension and profit-sharing plans, and health insurance, legal and training plans. Contributions to the plans are determined in accordance with the provisions of the negotiated labor contract. The Local 32BJ Service Employees International Union contract is in effect through December 31, 2019.
Legal Proceedings
 
From time to time, we are party to various lawsuits, claims for negligence and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business. We do not believe that the results of any such claims or litigation, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations if determined adversely to us.
