Introduction
 
Hecla Mining Company and our subsidiaries have provided precious and base metals to the U.S. and worldwide since 1891 (in this report, “we” or “our” or “us” refers to Hecla Mining Company and our affiliates and subsidiaries, unless the context requires otherwise). We discover, acquire, develop, and produce silver, gold, lead and zinc.  In doing so, we intend to manage our business activities in a safe, environmentally responsible and cost-effective manner.
 
We produce lead, zinc and bulk concentrates, which we sell to custom smelters and brokers, and unrefined precipitate and bullion bars (doré) containing gold and silver, which are further refined before sale to precious metals traders.  We are organized and managed in four segments that encompass our operating units: the Greens Creek, Lucky Friday, Casa Berardi, and San Sebastian units.
 

 



The map below shows the locations of our operating units and our exploration and pre-development projects, as well as our corporate offices located in Coeur d’Alene, Idaho, Vancouver, British Columbia and Val d'Or, Quebec.
 

Our current business strategy is to focus our financial and human resources in the following areas:
 

• | Operating our properties safely, in an environmentally responsible manner, and cost-effectively.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continue optimizing and improving operations at our Greens Creek, Lucky Friday, Casa Berardi, and San Sebastian units.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expanding our proven and probable reserves and production capacity at our operating properties.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Conducting our business with financial stewardship to preserve our financial position in varying metals price environments.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Advancing permitting of the Rock Creek and Montanore projects. We acquired Rock Creek as part of the acquisition of Revett Mining Company ("Revett") in June 2015, and we acquired Montanore through the acquisition of Mines Management, Inc. ("Mines Management") in September 2016.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Maintaining and investing in exploration and pre-development projects in the vicinities of six mining districts and projects we believe to be under-explored and under-invested: North Idaho's Silver Valley in the historic Coeur d'Alene Mining District; our Greens Creek unit on Alaska's Admiralty Island located near Juneau; the silver-producing district near Durango, Mexico; the Abitibi region of north-western Quebec, Canada; the Rock Creek and Montanore projects in northwestern Montana; and the Creede district of Southwestern Colorado.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continuing to seek opportunities to acquire and invest in mining and exploration properties and companies.

See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Results of Operations for a summary of average market and realized prices for each of the three years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.   Our results of operations are significantly impacted by fluctuations in the prices of silver, gold, lead and zinc, which are affected by numerous factors beyond our control.  See Item 1A. Risk Factors – Financial Risks – A substantial or extended decline in metals prices would have a material adverse effect on us for information on a number of the various factors that can impact prices of the metals we produce. Our average realized prices for silver, gold, zinc and lead were higher in 2016 compared to 2015, and were lower in 2015 compared to 2014.  Market metal price trends are a significant factor in our operating and financial performance.  We are unable to predict fluctuations in prices for metals and have limited control over the timing of our concentrate shipments which impacts our realized prices. However, we utilize financially-settled forward contracts for lead and zinc with the objective of managing the exposure to changes in prices of lead and zinc contained in our concentrate shipments between the time of sale and final settlement. In addition, we utilize a similar program for silver and gold with the objective of managing exposure to changes in prices for those metals contained in our concentrate shipments.  See Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our base and precious metal forward contract programs.
 

• | Cost of sales and other direct production costs of $339.0 million in 2016, $293.6 million in 2015, $304.4 million in 2014, $235.3 million in 2013 and $134.1 million in 2012. Cost of sales and other direct production costs in 2016 were impacted by commencement of sales at our San Sebastian unit in the first quarter of 2016. During 2012 and 2013, costs of sales and other direct production costs were impacted by the temporary suspension of production at the Lucky Friday mine during most of 2012 and by the acquisition of the Casa Berardi mine during 2013. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Results of Operations for more information.

Products and Segments
 
Our segments are differentiated by geographic region. We produce zinc, lead and bulk flotation concentrates at our Greens Creek unit and lead and zinc flotation concentrates at our Lucky Friday unit, each of which we sell to custom smelters and brokers on contract. The flotation concentrates produced at our Greens Creek and Lucky Friday units contain payable silver, zinc and lead, and at Greens Creek they also contain payable gold. At Greens Creek, we also produce gravity concentrate containing silver, gold and lead. Unrefined bullion (doré) is produced from the gravity concentrate by a third party processor and sold to a precious metal refiner. We also produce unrefined gold and silver bullion bars (doré) at Casa Berardi and San Sebastian, which are shipped to refiners before sale of the metals to precious metals traders. Payable metals are those included in our products which we are paid for by smelters, brokers and refiners. Our segments as of December 31, 2016 included:

• | The Greens Creek unit located on Admiralty Island, near Juneau, Alaska. Greens Creek is 100% owned and has been in production since 1989, with a temporary care and maintenance period from April 1993 through July 1996.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Lucky Friday unit located in northern Idaho. Lucky Friday is 100% owned and has been a producing mine for us since 1958. Production at the Lucky Friday unit returned to historical levels in September 2013 following a period of rehabilitation and no production in 2012.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Casa Berardi unit located in the Abitibi region of north-western Quebec, Canada. Casa Berardi is 100% owned and was acquired on June 1, 2013 with the purchase of all issued and outstanding common shares of Aurizon. Aurizon had operated and produced from the Casa Berardi mine since late 2006 and began various mine enhancements in an effort to improve operational efficiency, including a shaft deepening project completed in 2014 and a new paste fill facility completed in 2013.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The San Sebastian unit located in the state of Durango, Mexico. San Sebastian is 100% owned, and had previously produced for us from underground mines between 2001 and 2005. Recent near-surface exploration discoveries in the vicinity of the past producing area led to the decision in the third quarter of 2015 to develop shallow open pit mines there. Production commenced from the open pits in the fourth quarter of 2015.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The contributions to our consolidated sales by our operating units in 2016 were 40.3% from Greens Creek, 27.4% from Casa Berardi, 17.6% from San Sebastian, and 14.7% from Lucky Friday. Commercial production commenced at San Sebastian in the fourth quarter of 2015, with the first sales made there in the first quarter of 2016.
 
The table below summarizes our production for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.  Zinc and lead production quantities are presented in short tons (“tons”).

Zinc (tons) | | 68,516 | | 70,073 | | 67,969 

   
Licenses, Permits and Claims/Concessions
 
We are required to obtain various licenses and permits to operate our mines and conduct exploration and reclamation activities.  The suspension in production at the Lucky Friday unit during 2012 was pursuant to an order from the Federal Mine Safety and Health Administration. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - Legal, Market and Regulatory Risks - We are required to obtain governmental permits and other approvals in order to conduct mining operations. Further, each of our Rock Creek and Montanore projects can only be developed if we are successful in obtaining the necessary permits. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - Legal, Market and Regulatory Risks - Legal challenges could prevent the Rock Creek or Montanore projects from ever being developed. In addition, our operations and exploration activities at our Casa Berardi and San Sebastian units are conducted pursuant to claims or concessions granted by the host government, and otherwise are subject to claims renewal and minimum work commitment requirements, which are subject to certain political risks associated with foreign operations.  See Item 1A. Risk Factors - Operation, Development, Exploration and Acquisition Risks - Our foreign activities are subject to additional inherent risks.

Physical Assets
 
Our business is capital intensive and requires ongoing capital investment for the replacement, modernization and expansion of equipment and facilities and to develop new ore reserves.  At December 31, 2016, the book value of our properties, plants, equipment and mineral interests, net of accumulated depreciation, was approximately $2.0 billion.  For more information see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. We maintain insurance policies against property loss and business interruption.  However, such insurance contains exclusions and limitations on coverage, and there can be no assurance that claims would be paid under such insurance policies in connection with a particular event.  See Item 1A. Risk Factors - Operation, Development, Exploration and Acquisition Risks - Our operations may be adversely affected by risks and hazards associated with the mining industry that may not be fully covered by insurance.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, we employed 1,396 people, and we believe relations with our employees are generally good.
 
Many of the employees at our Lucky Friday unit are represented by a union. The most recent collective bargaining agreement with workers at our Lucky Friday unit expired on April 30, 2016, and on February 19, 2017, the unionized employees voted against our contract offer. We expect further discussions with the union but it is possible that an agreement will not be reached, in which case we cannot predict what might happen next, including what actions we or the union might take in response to failing to reach an agreement.
