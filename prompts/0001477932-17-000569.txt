Item 1. Description of Business
Overview
 
A & C United Agriculture Developing Inc., or the "Company," is a Nevada corporation formed on February 7, 2011. Our principal executive office is located at Oak Brook Pointe, Suite 500, 700 Commerce Drive, Oak Brook IL 60523. Tel: 630-288-2500.
 
In addition to the U.S. operation, the Company established a subsidiary A & C Agriculture Developing (Europe) AB in Stockholm, Sweden in October 24, 2013, which is located at Gamla Sodertaljevagen 134A, 141 70 Segeltorp, Sweden.
 
Since the inception, the Company's long-term goals have been to solve some of the major agricultural challenges in China, such as food safety issue, soil health problem and outdated farming practices, as well as to raise funds via an IPO to grow our business and to become the leader in the agriculture area. As the Company's name has suggested, the management team believes by unifying the valuable resources the Company is able to access, the above goals can be realized.
 
The Company has been and will be putting more resources in the seed business as it is still the main source of the Company's revenue. However, the Company has also been and will continue to be working to leverage the resources that it believes can be obtained via strategic alliances in the future on both sides of the Pacific Ocean in order to expand the business scope.
 
Current Operational Activities
 
The Company’s total revenue for fiscal year 2016 has exceeded $1.2 million dollars which is more than 70% increase comparing with the total revenue of $732,000 for fiscal year 2015. The management team will strive to maintain this momentum. The Company is also focusing on increasing the profit margin by creating more value-added services such as holding field demonstration and seminars with breeders for growers.
 
The revenue of the 4th fiscal quarter of 2016 is much lower than anticipated due to delayed shipments. However the revenue for the first fiscal quarter of 2017 is estimated to be higher than anticipated as it will include revenue for the delayed shipments. 
 
The trials with CapGen are still progressing and the Company has placed an official production request for one of the few potential varieties. The two companies have continued meeting at GapGen’s R&D facility in Spain and trial sites in China. CapGen will provide us more varieties targeting the China market for us to trial. 
 
Outside the seed business, the management team has also been working with potential investors on another project the Company has been working on. This project is trying to tackle the agricultural pollution issue affecting massive arable lands in China. Currently, the Company is working with a couple of Chinese companies who are interested in testing out the solutions we provided. China central government just issued a new act called “Soil 10 Chapters” that is aiming to reverse the damages in the next few decades. It encourages organic, more eco-friendly solution for the soil health issue which we believe is serious in China. The Company believes this may create greater opportunities for the companies such as ours that have already put efforts in the field. There is no written agreement as of today and might never have one between the potential investors and us, however we have exchanged ideas and strategies of how the entire project should proceed. 
 
During the next 12 months, we anticipate continuing our efforts to raise capital through follow up meetings with potential investors, although there is no assurance we will raise capital from any of them as we have no contracts, agreements or commitments from this or other funding sources.
 
We believe we will have sufficient cash available (assuming we collect all our existing and anticipated sales and receivables) to fund all of our operational and SEC filing needs during the next 12 months.

Sales, Marketing and Distribution
 
Currently we have sold vegetable seeds to distributors that are located Beijing and Guangdong provinces who resell these seeds throughout China. We currently sell only to distributors and not to end users. We select and test various types of seeds for different weather types at different locations. We believe that higher germination rate, high yielding, stability, relatively shorter maturity are the main criteria for most of the customers and end users. We currently offer and sell and in the future will continue to offer and sell only seeds that have not been genetically modified. GMO stands for genetically modified organism and is an organism whose genetic material has been altered using genetic engineering techniques. GMO vegetable seeds are not allowed to be sold in China. We do not have written contracts with our current customers and end users.
 
We primarily sell our seed through our network of distributors and dealers and brokers in China. We do not currently have or expect to have in the future formal distribution agreements with our distributors, but instead, will operate on the basis of purchase orders and invoices. The price, terms of sale, trade credit and payment terms are negotiated on a customer-by-customer basis. Our arrangements with our distributors do not include a right of return. Typical terms for customers require payment in full within 60 days of the date of shipment. In certain cases such as supply shortage, sales to our dealers will be paid in advance. Our credit policies are determined based upon the long-term nature of the relationship with our customers and end users. Credit limits are now and will continue to be established for individual customers based on historical collection experience, current economic and market conditions and a review of the current status of each customer's trade accounts receivable.
 
We believe that selling through dealers and distributors will enable us to reach growers in areas where there are geographic or other constraints on direct sales efforts. We select dealers and distributors based on shared vision, technical expertise, local market knowledge and financial stability. We will limit the number of dealers with whom we have relationships in any particular area. In addition, we are building dealer/distributor loyalty through an emphasis on service, access to breeders, ongoing training and promotional material support.
 
Our best marketing tool has been and will continue to be the word of mouth. We have participated and plan to continue to participate in important national/international seed shows globally several times a year to networking and social marketing.
 
Supply and Trial Cycle
 
Based upon management's experience in the industry and our operating history to date, we believe there is an adequate supply in the United States of the types of vegetable seeds we intend to sell in China. We believe that with advanced technology and mature global seed accessibility, U.S seed companies have provided us with and will in the future continue to be able to provide us with the varieties Chinese end users are looking for. We continue to be focused on finding the right varieties. We first collect specifications from Chinese end users, then match them with the varieties available in the U.S. We ask suppliers for samples or sometimes purchase small amount of seeds. We then try them in various locations in China at different planting seasons.
 
We have identified most of the farms for potential trials from farms our management has worked with or are targeting for initial seed trials through the trial businesses run by our management. We have not encountered any significant obstacles in getting theses farms to test our seeds. These farms have their own trial areas side by side with their production farm land. We have sold and will continue to sell them our new varieties of seeds to plant in the trial areas next to the areas where they grow their vegetables with their existing seed varieties. We believe, and we have seen in operation, that this type of trial process does not significantly impact these farms current production, as it uses a small test area next to where they have traditionally grown their vegetables, and thus provides the best test results since our seeds will be used to grow vegetables in the same location and conditions as their existing vegetable production. The challenge we have is that not all the varieties we may initially select will prove to work as well as we believed in China. Some varieties we have trialed have worked and some have not. The trial cycle can be over a year in some cases.
 
We do not offerany material right of return on our product although we do reimburse buyers on a case-by-case basis if seeds we sell do not perform well for a particular grower through no fault of the grower.

Seasonality
 
Sale of vegetable seed is affected by seasonal planting patterns of farmers in the geographical areas in China which our seed varieties are currently will in the future be sold. We believe that our sales and earnings performance in North China typically will be the strongest in the autumn and South China in spring. We believe that our working capital requirements will be typically greatest in our second and third fiscal quarters since payments to growers are largely deferred until this time. We believe that our trade receivables will be at a low point in August and increase through the selling season to peak at the end of the second fiscal quarter.
Customers
 
We are currently selling our seeds only to wholesalers in China. We are continuing our efforts to ramp up our selling efforts in China in fiscal year 2017. Although we may source seeds and strategic agreement from the U.S. and Europe, we have not to date but might in the future plan on selling our seeds or conducting related aspects of our business other than in China.
Our Competition and Our Market Position
 
Competition in the vegetable seed industry in China and internationally is intense. We face direct competition by other seed companies, including small family-owned businesses, as well as subsidiaries or other affiliates of chemical, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, many of which have substantially greater resources than we do. We are a small competitor in the market.
 
Our principal larger competitors are Monsanto, Syngenta, Limagrain, Bejo, China National Seed Group Co., Ltd. We compete with these larger competitors by offering more flexibility and quicker turnaround time when potential customers or distributors are asking for new seed varieties. There are about 50-60 small to mid-size local Chinese companies that are also importing foreign seeds with which we also compete. We use our management research on the American seed supplier market and contacts we have made with the American supplier market in competing with these competitors, although this may not give us any competitive advantage over our competitors.
 
However, many of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater research and product development capabilities and financial, marketing and human resources than we do. As a result, these competitors may:
 


· | succeed in developing products that are equal to or superior to our products or potential products or that achieve greater market acceptance than our products or potential products;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | devote greater resources to developing, marketing or selling their products; 
· | respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or scientific advances which could render our products or potential products obsolete or less preferable; 
· | obtain patents that block or otherwise inhibit our ability to develop and commercialize potential products we might otherwise develop; 
· | withstand price competition more successfully than we can; 
· | establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that enhance their ability to address the needs of our customers or prospective customers; and 
· | take advantage of acquisition or other opportunities more readily than we can.

Environmental and Regulatory Matters
 
Our agricultural operations are subject to a broad range of evolving environmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act. These environmental laws and regulations are intended to address concerns related to air quality, storm water discharge and management and disposal of agricultural chemicals relating to seed treatment both for domestic and overseas varieties.
 
Compliance with these laws and related regulations is an ongoing process that is not expected to have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. Environmental concerns are, however, inherent in most major agricultural operations, including those conducted by us, and there can be no assurance that the cost of compliance with environmental laws and regulations will not be material. Moreover, it is possible that future developments, such as increasingly strict environmental laws and enforcement policies thereunder, and further restrictions on the use of agricultural chemicals, could result in increased compliance costs.
 
We also are subject to the Federal Seed Act (the "FSA"), which regulates the interstate shipment of agricultural and vegetable seed. The FSA requires that seed shipped in interstate commerce be labeled with information that allows seed buyers to make informed choices and mandates that seed labeling information and advertisements pertaining to seed must be truthful. The FSA also helps promote uniformity among state laws and fair competition within the seed industry.
 
Internationally, we are subject to various government laws and regulations (including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar non-U.S. laws and regulations) and local government regulations. To help ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, we have adopted specific risk management and compliance practices and policies, including a specific policy addressing the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
 
We are also subject to numerous other laws and regulations applicable to businesses operating in China, including, without limitation, health and safety regulations. Specifically, vegetable seeds are allowed with to be imported from the U.S. into China with no Chinese taxes under an application process. For each import transaction, we need to submit the import/export application form that contains seed quantity and its Latin term to China Agriculture Department. If the seeds are not on a prohibited list, then the approval is granted. The procedure involves the following steps:
 


· | First, submit the import/export application form that contains seed quantity and its Latin term to China Agriculture Department. If the seeds are not on a prohibited list, then the approval is granted. We anticipate this will take approximately two weeks. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Second, once we get the approval from the China Agriculture Department, we submit our request to a sub-department within China Agriculture Department to get the phytosanitary request, on which they will list all the diseases China does not allow that might come with this variety we are importing. We anticipate this will take approximately two weeks.
· | Third, once we get the list of diseases, we will send it to the seed supplier located in U.S., and the supplier will provide the phytosanitary certificate with the seed to indicate the seed does not contain any of the diseases listed in the phytosanitary request from China. We anticipate this will take approximately two weeks. 
· | Finally, the original phytosanitary certificate will be sent with the seeds when we ship the seeds to the importer in China. An electronic copy will be sent to the importer as an advance notice. 

 
The average total time it will take to secure all required permits for import of our seeds has been approximately five weeks, but in the future this period could be longer or shorter depending upon each particular seed variety we want to import. If we do not secure these required permits from the China Agriculture Department for each of our seed import transactions, we would not be able to import the seeds subject to that request or fill the related customers or distributors orders.
