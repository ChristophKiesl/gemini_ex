ITEM 1. BUSINESS
OVERVIEW
Headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida, Stein Mart, Inc. is a national specialty omnichannel off-price retailer offering designer and name-brand fashion apparel, home décor, accessories and shoes at everyday discount prices. Stein Mart provides real value that customers love every day both in stores and online. For more information, please visit www.steinmart.com. Begun in the early 1900s as a single store in Greenville, Mississippi, Stein Mart, Inc. was organized in Mississippi in 1968 before merging into a Florida corporation in 1992. Stein Mart, Inc. operated 283 stores in 30 states and an omnichannel Ecommerce retail selling site as of February 1, 2020. Subsequent to February 1, 2020, we closed two stores, resulting in 281 stores that we operate as of the date of this filing.
As used herein, the terms “we,” “our,” “us,” "the Company," and “Stein Mart” refer to Stein Mart, Inc., a Florida corporation, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic and Ability to Continue as a Going Concern
In response to the coronavirus ("COVID-19") pandemic, on March 18, 2020, we temporarily closed all of our stores through March 31, 2020. On March 31, 2020, based on guidance from federal, state and local government and health authorities, and in the interest of the health and safety of our customers and associates, we extended the temporary closure of all stores beyond the previously announced March 31 date. We started reopening stores on April 23, 2020 as government jurisdictions have allowed, and as of the date of this filing, we have reopened substantially all of our 281 stores in limited capacity (through reduced hours and/or social distancing measures limiting the number of customers in our stores). We have implemented significant actions to mitigate the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our cash flows to protect our business and associates for the long-term. These actions include furloughing most store associates and a significant number of associates in our supply chain network and corporate offices. In addition, we have temporarily reduced the salaries of our executive management by 20 percent and associates not furloughed by a lower rate, and the Board of Directors has suspended its compensation. We have also been working with vendors and landlords to negotiate temporary terms and have utilized funds available under our Revolving Credit Facility and Third Promissory Note (see "Liquidity and Capital Resources" included in Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for further discussion). 
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent temporary store closures, our revenues, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows, and our ability to pay vendors and landlords according to standard terms have been materially adversely impacted. Accordingly, our management has determined that there is a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern over the next twelve months and our independent registered public accounting firm has included a “going concern” explanatory paragraph in their report on our financial statements as of and for the year ended February 1, 2020. Although having a going concern note in our financial statements is an Event of Default under our Credit Agreement and Term Loan Agreement, we have obtained waivers of such defaults as described in further detail in "Liquidity and Capital Resources" included in Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" below. We are actively negotiating with vendors and landlords regarding restructuring payment of unpaid accounts payable and rent, but there is no assurance those discussions will be successful. We are also actively exploring additional sources of financing to provide us with additional liquidity and other strategic alternatives, including a sale of the company. However, there is no assurance that such efforts will be successful.
As stores have reopened, the traffic at our stores has steadily increased, but has not yet recovered to pre-pandemic levels. Although omnichannel sales have remained strong, they have not compensated for the loss of in-store sales. Sales continue to recover as our stores reopen, but remain well below last year.
Merger Agreement
On January 31, 2020, the Company announced that it had entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among Stratosphere Holdco, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Parent”), Stratosphere Merger Sub, Inc., a Florida corporation and indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (“Merger Sub”), and the Company, providing for the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the “Merger”), with the Company surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Parent is an affiliate of Kingswood Capital Management, LLC ("Kingswood") and, at the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, certain interests of Parent would have been owned by one or more investment funds managed by Kingswood and an entity managed by Jay Stein, the Chairman of the Company's Board. Under the Merger Agreement, stockholders of the Company would have received $0.90 in cash for each share of Company common stock. The Merger was unanimously approved by the Company's Board of Directors on January 30, 2020. The Merger was subject to the approval of the Company's stockholders. On April 16, 2020, the Merger was terminated by the mutual agreement among the parties thereto. See Note 14. "Merger Agreement" to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information about the Merger Agreement.
KEY STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES
Our mission is to provide current season, first-quality fashion apparel, shoes, accessories and home décor merchandise at prices comparable to off-price retail chains in a convenient, attractive and easy-to-shop location. We believe our success and future growth will depend on the consistent execution of the following:
•Having a desirable, current season assortment of designer, brand-name, exclusive and proprietary fashion apparel, accessories and home décor merchandise,
•Sourcing a wide range of key brands and maintaining strong partnerships with the vendors representing those brands,
•Offering everyday low prices on fashion merchandise through buying methodologies and low-cost operations,
•Attracting repeat and new customers through marketing and advertising programs,
•Having an attractive store appearance, appealing merchandise presentation and on-demand customer service, like a specialty store,
•Maintaining current locations in regional, community and neighborhood shopping centers serving a more affluent customer, and
•Building and growing our omnichannel business.
TARGET CUSTOMER
Our target customer is a woman who is both style conscious and value seeking. She is typically married and college educated. She may be multi-cultural, works at least part-time in a professional position and has above-average household income.
MERCHANDISING, PURCHASING AND PRICING
Our fashion assortment is driven primarily by seasonal fashion trends and a focus on name brand and designer merchandise, complemented by a select program of private label and proprietary/exclusive merchandise. During 2019, approximately seven percent of our sales were from private label or proprietary/exclusive merchandise.
Our merchants purchase products from approximately 900 vendors. One of our vendors accounted for approximately seven percent of our total purchases during 2019. We buy a majority of our merchandise at the same time and from many of the same manufacturers as traditional department/specialty stores; however, we generally do not require the same level of front and back-end vendor concessions, such as advertising allowances, return privileges and markdown allowances, which are common and significant in the department store industry. As a result, we believe that our buyers can negotiate more favorable upfront pricing terms from our vendors. We also purchase merchandise opportunistically when we believe a combination of the product and the price makes it a compelling addition to our assortment. In both instances, we pass our savings on to our customers through everyday low pricing targeted to be competitive with off-price retail chains. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our merchandise vendors may have been negatively impacted by the financial difficulties of other retailers, thereby creating concerns about vendors' ability to provide us with payment terms or merchandise that is suitable to our brand.
Our shoe department and vintage luxury handbag inventory are exclusively supplied and owned by DSW, Inc. (“DSW”) and LXRandCo, Inc. (“LXR”), respectively. DSW’s and LXR’s buyers determine each season’s fashion footwear and handbag assortment, respectively. Our commissions from the sales of these licensed departments are included in net sales on our Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The following table sets forth the percentage of our sales by major merchandise category, including shoe department sales, for the fiscal years indicated:

 | 2019 | | 2018
Women’s apparel | 49 | % | | 48 | %
Men’s | 18 | % | | 19 | %
Home | 10 | % | | 10 | %
Accessories | 9 | % | | 9 | %
Shoes | 9 | % | | 9 | %
Other | 5 | % | | 5 | %
Total | 100 | % | | 100 | %

LOCATIONS AND STORE APPEARANCE
On February 1, 2020, we operated 283 stores in 30 states and an online retail selling site. Our stores are located in the Northeast, Midwest, Southeast, Texas and the Southwest. We are most fully concentrated in the Southeast and Texas where 182 of our stores are located. Most locations are in neighborhoods, community and regional shopping centers frequented by a more affluent customer. Our optimal co-tenants within these shopping centers cater to a similar target customer and include highly-frequented retail formats such as other apparel retailers, higher-end grocers and restaurants. All Stein Mart locations, including the corporate headquarters and distribution centers, are leased. On March 18, 2020, we temporarily closed all of our stores through March 31, 2020. On March 31, 2020, based on guidance from federal, state and local government and health authorities, and in the interest of the health and safety of our customers and associates, we extended the temporary closure of all stores beyond the previously announced March 31 date. We started reopening stores on April 23, 2020 as government jurisdictions have allowed, and as of the date of this filing, we have reopened substantially all of our 281 stores in limited capacity (through reduced hours and/or social distancing measures limiting the number of customers in our stores). In addition, as of June 10, 2020, we have negotiated amendments for approximately 220 of our properties and are in current negotiations with 41 of our landlords to amend our lease terms to defer a portion of the rent or other expenses due during the time period that our properties were closed and we are actively seeking to negotiate with our other landlords, although there is no assurance that we will be successful.
We selectively seek additional store locations that strengthen our portfolio in current as well as new markets. We utilize regional tenant representative brokers to help us identify potential sites for new or relocated stores. New and relocated store decisions are supported by independent sales forecasts, and are approved by a real estate committee made up of senior-level executives. We are not planning to open any new stores in fiscal 2020.
Our typical store is approximately 34,000 gross square feet. They have a racetrack design, conveniently centralized check-out and individual dressing rooms. We display merchandise in lifestyle groupings of apparel and accessories, which we believe enables our customers to locate desired merchandise in a manner that encourages multiple purchases. We seek to create excitement in our stores through the continual flow of fashion merchandise, targeted sales promotions, store layout, merchandise presentation and the quality, value and depth of our merchandise assortment.
OMNICHANNEL CAPABILITIES
We sell merchandise offerings on our website at www.steinmart.com. We continually evolve our online content and capabilities to more fully integrate our online business with our stores to provide our customers with an enhanced omnichannel experience. Website offerings include many of the same products offered in our stores, as well as exclusive online products that have greatly expanded as a result of increased drop shipments from vendors. Website orders can be shipped from our dedicated warehouse, our stores, or, in some cases, directly from our vendors. Another option the website offers is our buy online, pick up in store service ("BOPIS"). In our stores, we have "endless aisle" mobile technology to assist customers in locating merchandise across the enterprise and then placing an online order. The website also provides information for customers regarding store locations, brands, products and selected sales promotion activity. Customers may also apply for our credit card, sign up to be SMart Rewards loyalty members, sign up for email notifications and purchase gift cards online. Omnichannel sales, defined as all online sales regardless of fulfillment channel, amounted to approximately 6.0 percent and 5.3 percent of our total sales in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our Ecommerce software and warehouse distribution are managed by two third-party providers.
CUSTOMER SERVICE
Our stores offer many services typically found in better department or specialty stores, such as endless aisle mobile technology to locate product for customers and order it online, a SMart Rewards loyalty program, co-branded and private label credit card programs and electronic gift cards. Each store is staffed with a number of sales associates to provide on-demand customer service.
MARKETING
Our marketing efforts are focused on driving brand awareness, communicating our value proposition and driving traffic for periodic short-duration events. Our strategy is designed to energize our existing customers as well as acquire new customers. We engage in periodic market research, including customer surveys, to identify how best to reach each of these audiences and, in consultation with our outside advertising, media planning and direct-marketing agencies, we adjust our marketing plans accordingly.
To reach a broader audience, we continue to evolve our media mix to decrease newspaper, maintain direct mail, and increase digital and broadcast media, as increased branded television advertising drives brand awareness and customers to our online site. During 2019, we implemented a campaign management tool to execute automated marketing campaigns based on customer behavior. Utilizing point-of-sale and online browsing and spending information, we are creating targeted, personalized email and direct mail messaging focused on individuals' preferences.
LOYALTY PROGRAM 
We evolved our customer loyalty program in October 2019 by combining our Credit Card and Preferred Customer programs into a single loyalty program called SMart Rewards. The enhanced program allows Stein Mart credit cardholders to earn 2 points for every $1 spent at Stein Mart, and Elite cardholders ($500 annual spend) earn 4 points for every $1 spent. All cardholders receive a $10 reward, called Stein Mart SMart Cash, for every 1,000 points earned.
We have both co-branded MasterCard and Private Label Credit Cards (together, “Stein Mart Credit Cards”) available for our customers based on credit approvals. All Stein Mart credit cardholders participate in our SMart Rewards loyalty program. While the primary purpose of offering our credit cards is to increase customer loyalty and drive sales, we also receive credit card revenue through our program agreement with our business partner, Synchrony Financial (“Synchrony”).
Our credit cards are issued by Synchrony in accordance with our Amended and Restated Co-Brand and Private Label Credit Card Consumer Program Agreement (the “Agreement”). Synchrony bears all credit risk associated with the cards and provides us certain direct financial benefits based on sales on the cards and other factors. On August 21, 2019, we entered into an amendment to our Agreement with Synchrony whereby Synchrony waived its rights to require us to post cash reserves to cure our failure to satisfy one or more of the quarterly financial covenants specified in the Agreement for periods through October 31, 2020 (the “Exemption Period”). As consideration for Synchrony’s entry into this amendment, we agreed to reduce the amount of fees paid to us by Synchrony under the Agreement from September 1, 2019 through the end of the Exemption Period. 
COMPETITION
We operate in an intensely competitive retail industry. Our primary competitors for both our stores and online are department and specialty stores, as well as conventional off-price retail chains. From our customer’s perspective, we believe that we differentiate ourselves from department and specialty stores with our (i) lower initial pricing, (ii) convenient locations in shopping centers and (iii) assortments that are more selective than department stores and more varied than specialty stores. We also believe that we differentiate ourselves from typical off-price retail chains by offering (i) primarily current season first-quality merchandise carried by better department or specialty stores, (ii) a stronger merchandising “statement,” consistently offering more depth of color and size in individual stock-keeping units, (iii) merchandise presentation and customer service more comparable to upscale retailers, (iv) competitive price levels and (v) expanded omnichannel capabilities.
DISTRIBUTION
Our logistics network consists of consolidation centers (“CCs”) located in the Atlanta, Los Angeles and New Jersey areas, and store distribution centers (“SDCs”) located in the Atlanta, Dallas and Los Angeles areas. Approximately 55 percent of the vendor shipments are aggregated at the CCs and then shipped to the SDCs with the remaining 45 percent moving directly from vendors to SDCs. The SDCs receive, check and prepare the merchandise to ensure it is floor ready for our stores. The SDCs are automated and virtually all of our vendors are electronic data interchange (“EDI”) capable so we are able to cross-dock a high percentage of our receipts. Store deliveries are made by contract carriers once or twice a week, depending on location, store volume and the time of year. The New Jersey CC is the only facility managed by a third-party logistics provider.
EMPLOYEES
As of February 1, 2020, our workforce consisted of approximately 9,000 employees (equivalent to approximately 5,000 40-hour employees). Each of our stores employs an average of 30 persons. The number of employees fluctuates during the year based on the selling season. We have no employees subject to collective bargaining agreements. In March 2020, we furloughed most store associates and a significant number of associates in our supply chain network and corporate offices due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As our offices and stores have reopened, most corporate employees have returned from furlough; however, a significant number of our store and supply chain employees remain on furlough. As of May 30, 2020, our workforce consisted of approximately 8,400 employees (equivalent to approximately 2,400 40-hour employees), with approximately 5,200 furloughed. We have reduced the number of corporate and store employees following the reopening of the stores as part of an overall effort to reduce expenses and improve profitability.
SEASONALITY
Our business is seasonal in nature. Sales and profitability are historically higher in the first and fourth quarters of the fiscal year, which include the spring and holiday seasons.
TRADEMARKS
We own the federally registered trademark Stein Mart®, together with a number of other marks used in conjunction with our private label merchandise program. We believe that our trademarks are important, but, with the exception of Stein Mart®, not critical to our merchandising strategy.
