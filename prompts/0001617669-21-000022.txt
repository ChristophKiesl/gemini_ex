Overview
Unique Fabricating is engaged in the engineering and manufacture of multi-material foam, rubber, and plastic components utilized in noise, vibration and harshness, acoustical management, water and air sealing, decorative and other functional applications. Unique Fabricating has combined a history of organic growth with strategic acquisitions to diversify its products and process capabilities and the markets we serve.
Unique Fabricating's markets are North America transportation, appliance, medical, and consumer off-road markets. Sales are conducted directly to major transportation, appliance, medical, and consumer off-road manufacturers, referred throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K as original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), or indirectly through the Tier 1 suppliers of these OEMs. The Company has its principal executive offices in Auburn Hills, Michigan and has sales, engineering and production facilities in Auburn Hills, Michigan; Concord, Michigan; LaFayette, Georgia; Louisville, Kentucky; Monterrey, Mexico; Querétaro, Mexico; and London, Ontario. The Company also has an independent client sales representative who maintains offices in Baldham, Germany.
Unique Fabricating derives most of its net sales from the sales of foam, rubber plastic, and tape adhesive related automotive products. These products are produced by a variety of manufacturing processes including die cutting, compression molding, thermoforming, reaction injection molding and fusion molding. We believe Unique Fabricating has a broader array of processes and materials utilized than any of its direct competitors, based on our product offerings. By sealing out air, noise, and water intrusion, and by providing sound absorption and blocking, Unique Fabricating’s products improve the interior comfort of a vehicle, increasing perceived vehicle quality and the overall experience of its passengers. Unique Fabricating’s products perform similar functions for appliances, water heaters, and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems (“HVAC”), improving thermal characteristics, reducing noise, and prolonging equipment life.
Our principal executive offices are currently located at 800 Standard Parkway, Auburn Hills, Michigan, 48326. UFI Acquisition, Inc, a Delaware Corporation (“UFI”), was formed in January 2013 to acquire 100% of the outstanding equity of Unique Fabricating, Inc., and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Unique Fabricating South, Inc. and Unique Fabricating de Mexico, S.A. de C.V. (collectively, such subsidiaries and other subsidiaries referenced in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as the “Company” or “Unique” or “Unique Fabricating”). In September 2014, UFI Acquisition, Inc. changed its name to Unique Fabricating, Inc. (“UFI”) which is now the parent company of the group. As a result of the name change, the subsidiary previously named Unique Fabricating, Inc. became Unique Fabricating NA, Inc.
Automotive Industry Analysis and Industry Trends
North America is the Company’s core market. We manufacture multi-material foam, rubber, plastic components, and tape adhesive related products utilized in noise, vibration and harshness management, acoustical management, water and air sealing, decorative and other functional applications.
Demand for automotive parts in the OEM market is generally a function of the number of new vehicles produced, which is primarily driven by macro-economic factors such as credit availability, interest rates, fuel prices, consumer confidence, employment, and other trends. Although OEM demand is tied to actual vehicle production, participants in the automotive parts industry also can grow through increasing product content per vehicle by increasing business with current customers and in existing markets, gaining new customers, and increasing share in adjacent markets. We believe that we are well-positioned to take advantage of these opportunities with the Company's strong North American geographical presence and advanced technology, engineering, manufacturing and customer support capabilities.
Based upon industry sources, we expect recovery in 2021 in North American light vehicle production from the COVID-19 impacted low levels in 2020. We also expect 7% growth in 2022 from 2021 production levels which have been impacted by the first half supply chain issues, including the chip shortage, logistics, and weather related challenges. We expect no growth in overall North American light vehicle production over the following 5 years.

(Source: IHS Market Automotive) (March 2021)
In addition to the low overall industry growth, we believe there are a variety of trends that continue to influence the future of the North American automotive market. We believe that we are well-positioned to benefit from an increasing number of trends driven by market forces such as:
▪Fuel efficiency/vehicle light-weighting:  Government mandates on fuel efficiency and emission reductions will continue to force the automotive industry to focus on improving the fuel economy of vehicles. This is one of the factors driving the trend of replacing heavier conventional materials in vehicle production with lighter weight components such as plastics and foams. 
▪Interior comfort:  Comfort of interiors consistently rank in the top three factors that consumers consider when purchasing a new vehicle and is a key area where vehicle manufactures can differentiate their vehicles. With the ongoing trend of electrification (no engine noise) and increasing demand for quieter vehicles, we expect the use of foam and acoustical insulation in vehicles to increase.
▪Telematics and Infotainment:  The increasing use of telematics and infotainment requires increasingly quieter vehicles for the telematics systems to recognize voice commands and passengers to enjoy the infotainment options. Over the next few years, the vast majority of all new vehicles are expected to include voice recognition systems, increasing the need for quiet interiors. We believe the result will increase the use of acoustic insulation materials, more precise air seals and other noise, vibration, and harshness products in all vehicles.
▪Rapid pace of new vehicle launches:  In order to meet consumers’ increasing demand for new products, the automotive market will see a significant number of new launches from vehicle manufacturers over the next few years. Each launch creates new product opportunities for us with the OEMs need for noise, vibration, and harshness (collectively “NVH”) and buzz, squeak, rattle (collectively “BSR”) solutions as they discover unplanned noise issues at the production launch for a new vehicle program. In many of these situations, we develop and begin supplying a solution within days, a level of responsiveness that avoids competitive requests for quotations and produces premium value for our customers.
▪Localization of production:  Due to freight costs, currency fluctuations, logistic issues and protection of supply, many foreign vehicle manufacturers have increased their North American production volumes and are increasing local sourcing of vehicle components. This trend has been accelerated with the impacts of the various supply chain shocks seen over the last year. We believe that Unique Fabricating’s production facilities situated in geographic proximity to most North American vehicle assembly locations provide a competitive advantage.
We believe these market trends create opportunities for us to achieve market share gains from increased content per vehicle, new solution-oriented products, geographic shifts in vehicle and component production, and evolving customer sourcing strategies. We continue to develop leading-edge solutions focused on addressing these trends, with products that enable our customers to produce distinctive market-leading products.
As an example of our innovative technical capabilities, we utilized our thermoforming process to develop and produce a line of lightweight flexible air duct systems for a leading OEM, providing an 80% weight reduction and enhanced functionality. This air duct system has developed into Unique Fabricating’s patent pending TwinShape® line of proprietary foam air ducts. Unique Fabricating has also leveraged our knowledge in our reaction injection molded (“RIM”) process and has begun to offer NVH and sealing products that meet or exceed stringent flammability requirements for all of the markets we serve. 
Appliance Market 
We are a leading provider of fabricated, non-metallic components to a diverse group of OEMs and tiered suppliers in the appliance, HVAC, and water heater industries. These sales represented approximately 9% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020. These components are primarily manufactured from foam, adhesives, fiberglass, rubber and board-back material. We have extensive materials, engineering and fabrication expertise and deliver custom-designed, innovative solutions for our customers. Our component solutions primarily consist of products used in gasketing, heat deflection, packaging, insulation, water seals, noise reduction and vibration control. Demand for these end-market products is largely driven by the replacement of older units and the broader health of the housing sector. According to the U.S. Census bureau, the seasonally adjusted annual rate for new housing starts in February 2021 was at 1.4 million. Existing home sales rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.7 million in January 2021, up 23% from January 2020.
The United States major household appliance industry, which includes water heaters, is forecast to show growth during 2021, as new and existing home sales, as well as home improvement spending, both of which have a direct impact on appliance industry sales, continue to show positive outlooks. Recent estimates for this annual growth rate have increased to between 1% to 2.5%. It is well documented that Covid-19 increased the amount of time individuals spend in the household as well as the number of individuals working from home. This “home nesting” behavior will continue to drive consumer spending towards home improvements as indicated by the Leading Indicator for Remodeling Activity (“LIRA”) which is projected to increase 8.5% from end of 2020 to 2021. We believe these benefits will increase the demand for our products from existing clients including GE, AO Smith, and Carrier.
