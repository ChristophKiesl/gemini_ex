ITEM 1. | Business

General
Heartland Express, Inc. is a holding company incorporated in Nevada, which owns all of the stock of Heartland Express, Inc. of Iowa, Heartland Express Services, Inc., Heartland Express Maintenance Services, Inc., and A & M Express, Inc. We operate as one segment (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements). For the period November 11, 2013 to July 1, 2016, the Company also operated Gordon Trucking, Inc. ("GTI"), which was merged into Heartland Express, Inc. of Iowa effective July 1, 2016.
We are a short-to-medium haul truckload carrier (predominately 500 miles or less per load). We concentrate primarily on short- to medium-haul, asset-based dry van truckload services in regional markets near our terminals, where the average trip is approximately one day. We focus on providing quality service to targeted customers with a high density of freight in our regional operating areas. We also offer primarily asset-based dry van service to our customers along with temperature-controlled truckload services, which are not significant to our operations. We exited our non-asset-based freight brokerage business in the first quarter of 2017. We generally earn revenue based on the number of miles per load delivered and the revenue per mile paid.  We believe the keys to success are maintaining high levels of customer service and safety which are predicated on the availability of experienced drivers and late-model equipment.  We believe that our service standards, safety record, and equipment accessibility have made us a core carrier to many of our major customers, as well as allowed us to build solid, long-term relationships with customers and brand ourselves as an industry leader for on-time service.
Our headquarters is located in North Liberty, Iowa, in a low-cost environment with ready access to a skilled, educated, and industrious workforce. Our other terminals are located near major shipping corridors nationwide, affording proximity to customer 
1

locations, driver domiciles, and distribution centers. We believe our geographic reach and terminal locations assist us with driver recruiting and retention, efficient fleet maintenance, and consistent customer engagement.
We were founded by Russell A. Gerdin in 1978 and became publicly traded in November 1986. Over the thirty years from 1986 to 2016, we have grown our revenues to $612.9 million from $21.6 million and our net income has increased to $56.4 million from $3.0 million. Much of our growth has been attributable to expanding service for existing customers, acquiring new customers, and continued expansion of our operating regions.  More information regarding our total assets, revenues and profits for the past three and five years can be found in our “Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income” and “Selected Financial Data” that are included in this report.
In addition to organic growth through the development of our regional operating areas, we have completed six acquisitions since 1987 with the most recent and largest occurring in 2013, GTI.  These six acquisitions have enabled us to solidify our position within existing regions, expand into new operating regions, and pursue new customer relationships in new markets. We are highly selective about acquisitions, with our main criteria being (i) safe operations, (ii) high quality professional truck drivers, (iii) fleet profile that is compatible with our philosophy or can be replaced economically, and (iv) freight profile that will allow a path to a low-80s operating ratio upon full integration, application of our cost structure, and freight optimization, including exiting certain loads that fail to meet our operating profile. Since the end of 2015, we have been evaluating acquisition candidates, although we have no agreements to make any acquisitions. Future growth depends upon several factors including the level of economic growth and the related customer demand, the available capacity in the trucking industry, our ability to identify and consummate future acquisitions, our ability to integrate operations of acquired companies to realize efficiencies, and our ability to attract and retain experienced drivers that meet our hiring standards.
Operations
Our operations department focuses on the successful execution of customer expectations and providing consistent opportunities for our drivers, in conjunction with maximizing equipment utilization.  These objectives require a combined effort of marketing, regional operations managers, and fleet management.
Our customer service department is responsible for maintaining the continuity between the customer’s needs and our ability to meet those needs by communicating the customer’s expectations to the fleet management group.  Collectively, the operations group (customer service and fleet management) and marketing are charged with developing customer relationships, ensuring service standards, coordinating proper freight-to-capacity balancing, trailer asset management, and daily tactical decisions to match customer demand with revenue equipment availability across our entire network.  They assign orders to drivers based on well-defined criteria, such as United States Department of Transportation (the “DOT”) hours of service compliance, customer requirements, equipment utilization, driver “home time”, limiting non-revenue miles, and equipment maintenance needs.
Fleet management employees are responsible for driver management and development.  Additionally, they maximize the capacity that is available to meet the service needs of our customers.  Their responsibilities include meeting the needs of the drivers within the standards that have been set by the organization and communicating the requirements of the customers to the drivers on each order to ensure successful execution.

Serving the short-to-medium haul market permits us to use primarily single rather than team drivers and dispatch most loads directly from origin to destination without an intermediate equipment change other than for driver scheduling purposes. Substantially all of our revenue is, and for the last three fiscal years has been, generated from within the United States (“U.S.”) with immaterial revenue derived from Canada. We do not have nor have we during the last three fiscal years had any long-lived assets permanently located outside the U.S. 
We operate twenty terminal facilities throughout the contiguous U.S. in addition to our terminal and corporate headquarters in North Liberty, Iowa. These terminal locations are strategically located to concentrate on regional freight movements generally within a 500-mile radius of the terminals. This allows us to meet the needs of our customers in those regions while allowing our drivers to primarily stay within an operating region which provides them with more “home time.” This also allows us to service and maintain revenue equipment at our facilities on a frequent basis.
Personnel at the individual terminal locations manage these operations based on the overall corporate operating and maintenance goals and objectives. We use a centralized computer network and regular communication to achieve enterprise-wide load coordination.

We emphasize customer satisfaction through on-time performance, dependable late-model equipment, and consistent equipment availability to meet the volume requirements of our customers. We also maintain a trailer to tractor ratio that allows us to position trailers at customer locations for convenient loading and unloading.  Most of the freight we transport is non-perishable and predominantly does not require driver handling.  These factors help minimize waiting time, which increases tractor utilization and promotes driver retention.
During 2016, we received the following safety and operational recognitions:

• | Commercial Carrier Journal Top 250 Award (#36)


• | BP Lubricants USA Inc. Driving Safety Standards for 2016


• | Logistics Management Quest for Quality Award


• | California Trucking Association - Fleet Safety Award (1st Place - LTL/Gen Commodities-Local/Short Haul, over 4 million miles)


• | California Trucking Association - Fleet Safety Award (1st Place - Truckload, over 7 million miles)

Customers and Marketing
We seek to transport freight that will complement traffic in our existing service areas and remain consistent with our focus on short-to-medium haul and regional distribution markets.  Management believes that building lane density in our primary traffic lanes will minimize empty miles and enhance driver “home time.” 
We target customers with multiple, time-sensitive shipments, including those utilizing “just-in-time” manufacturing and inventory management. In seeking these customers, we have positioned our business as a provider of premium service at compensatory rates, rather than competing solely on the basis of price. We believe our reputation for quality service, reliable equipment, and equipment availability makes us a core carrier for many of our customers.  This past year we once again were recognized for customer service by several of our customers as a testament to our service standards. These awards include: 

• | Fedex Express - Carrier of the Year (6th consecutive year and 9th time in 10 years)


• | Fedex Express - Platinum Award for On-Time Service (99.96% on-time service)


• | Sam's Club (Walmart) - Carrier of the Year


• | United Sugars - Carrier of the Year


• | Winegard - Truckload Carrier of the Year


• | Johnson and Johnson - Truckload Service Provider of the Year


• | Quaker/Gatorade - Carrier of the Year (Northwest Region)


• | Quaker/Gatorade - Carrier of the Year (Central West Region)


• | DHL - On Time Delivery - Truckload

Our primary customers include retailers and manufacturers. Our 25, 10, and 5 largest customers accounted for approximately 76%, 56%, and 40% of our operating revenues, respectively, in 2016. During 2015, our 25, 10, and 5 largest customers were approximately 73%, 53%, and 36%, of our operating revenues respectively. During 2014, our 25, 10, and 5 largest customers were approximately 68%, 47%, and 32%, of our operating revenues respectively. Our broad capacity network and customer base has allowed us to remain appropriately diversified as only one customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., accounted for more than 10% of our operating revenues in 2016 at 12.3%, while no customer accounted for more than 10% of our operating revenues in 2015 or 2014.
Seasonality
The nature of our primary traffic (appliances, automotive parts, consumer products, paper products, packaged foodstuffs, and retail goods) generally causes it to be distributed with relative uniformity throughout the year.  However, seasonal variations associated with the winter holiday season have historically resulted in increased shipment volumes by retail customers during the fourth quarter, followed by reduced shipment volumes by customers in several industries after the holiday season. In addition, our operating expenses historically have been higher during the winter months due to decreased fuel efficiency, increased colder weather-related equipment maintenance and repairs, and increased claims and costs attributed to higher accident frequency from harsh weather.
Drivers, Independent Contractors, and Other Employees
3

We rely on our workforce in achieving our business objectives.  Throughout the year ended December 31, 2016, we employed approximately 3,600 people compared to approximately 4,200 people throughout the year ended December 31, 2015. We also contracted with independent contractors to provide and operate tractors which provides us additional revenue equipment capacity.  Independent contractors own their own tractors and are responsible for all associated expenses, including financing costs, fuel, maintenance, insurance, and highway use taxes. We historically have operated a combined fleet of company and independent contractor tractors.  For the year ended December 31, 2016, independent contractors accounted for approximately 2.3% of our total miles compared to 3.1% in 2015.

Our strategy for both employee drivers and independent contractors is to (i) hire safe and experienced drivers (the majority of driver positions hired require six to nine months of over-the-road experience); (ii) promote retention with an industry-competitive compensation package, positive working conditions, and freight that requires little or no handling; and (iii) minimize safety problems through careful screening, mandatory drug testing, continuous training, electronic logging device ("ELD") system, and financial rewards for accident-free driving.  We also seek to minimize turnover of our employee drivers by providing modern, comfortable equipment, and by regularly scheduling "home time."  Our drivers are generally compensated on the basis of miles driven including empty miles. This provides an incentive for us to minimize empty miles and at the same time does not penalize drivers for inefficiencies of operations that are beyond their control. 
We are not a party to a collective bargaining agreement.  We believe that we have good relationships with our employees.
Driver Compensation
Our comprehensive driver compensation program rewards drivers for years of service and safe operating mileage benchmarks, which are critical to our operational and financial performance. Our driver pay package includes future pay increases based on years of continued service with us, increased rates for accident-free miles of operation, and detention pay to assist drivers with offsetting unproductive detention time. We believe that our driver compensation package is consistently among the best in the industry. We are committed to investing in our drivers and compensating them for safety as both are key to our operational and financial performance.
Revenue Equipment
Our tractor strategy is important to our goals and differs from the practices of many of our peers. We strive to operate a relatively new fleet to keep operating costs low, appeal to drivers, and enhance dependability. In addition, we seek the flexibility to buy and sell tractors (and trailers) opportunistically to capitalize on new and used equipment markets, size our fleet to the volume of attractive freight, and manage cash tax expense. One method we use to accomplish these goals is to depreciate our tractors for financial reporting purposes using the 125% declining balance method, in which depreciation is higher in early periods and tapers off in later periods. We believe this method more accurately reflects actual asset values and affords us the flexibility to sell tractors at most points during their life cycle without experiencing losses. In addition, the decline in depreciation during later periods is typically offset by increased repairs and maintenance expense as the tractors age, which keeps our total operating costs more uniform through fluctuations in average tractor fleet age. We believe our revenue equipment strategy is sound over the long term. However, it can contribute to volatility in gain on sale of equipment and quarterly earnings per share. 
At December 31, 2016, approximately 99% of our over-the-road sleeper berth tractor fleet was equipped with idle management controls. All tractors are equipped with mobile communication systems. This technology allows for efficient communication with our drivers regarding freight and safety, and provides the ability to manage the needs of our customers based on real-time information on load status. Our mobile communication systems also allow us to obtain information regarding equipment for better planning and efficient maintenance time as well as information regarding driver performance.  
As of December 31, 2016 the average age of our tractor fleet was 1.70 years compared to 1.25 years at December 31, 2015. We have historically operated the majority of our tractors while under warranty to minimize repair and maintenance cost and reduce service interruptions caused by breakdowns. The average age of our trailer fleet was 4.6 years at December 31, 2016 compared to 4.6 years at December 31, 2015.  
We obtain additional tractor capacity through the use of independent contractors who own their own tractor equipment, although our use of independent contractors is not material to our overall operations. Independent contractors are responsible for the maintenance of their equipment. We utilized revenue equipment operating leases following our most recent acquisition in 2013. As of December 31, 2016, operating leases were immaterial.

The "Regulation" section in this Item 1 of Part I of this Annual Report discusses in detail several regulations that have impacted and could continue to affect our cost and use of revenue equipment.
Fuel
We purchase diesel fuel ("fuel") over-the-road through a network of fuel stops throughout the U.S. at which we have negotiated price discounts.  In addition, bulk fuel sites are maintained at the majority of our twenty-one terminal locations. We strategically manage fuel purchase decisions based on pricing of over-the-road fuel prices, bulk fuel prices, and the routing of equipment. Both above ground and underground storage tanks are utilized at the bulk fuel sites.  We believe exposure to environmental cleanup costs is minimized by periodic inspection and monitoring of the tanks.  Increases in fuel prices can have an adverse effect on the results of operations.  We have fuel surcharge agreements with most customers that enable us to pass through most long-term price increases.  For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, fuel expense was $91.5 million, $123.7 million, and $219.3 million or 17.3%, 20.0%, and 29.7% respectively, of our total operating expenses.  For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, fuel surcharge revenues were $58.4 million, $91.8 million, and $170.4 million, respectively. Department of Energy (“DOE”) average price of fuel decreased 14.0% in 2016 compared to 2015 and 29.5% in 2015 compared to 2014, which had a positive impact on our net fuel cost for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. Additionally, overall fuel efficiency has improved during 2016 due to adding more fuel-efficient late-model tractors to the operating fleet, which include various idle management technologies. Fuel consumed by empty and out-of-route miles and by truck engine idling time is not recoverable and therefore any increases or decreases in fuel prices related to empty and out-of-route miles and idling time will directly impact our operating results. The DOE average price of fuel has increased 11.3% through February 17, 2017 as compared to the 2016 average price.
Competition and Industry
The truckload industry is highly competitive and fragmented with thousands of carriers of varying sizes.  We compete with other truckload carriers; primarily those serving the regional, short-to-medium haul market. Logistics providers, railroads, less-than-truckload carriers, and private fleets provide additional competition but to a lesser extent. The industry is highly competitive based primarily upon freight rates, qualified drivers, service, and equipment availability. 
The demand for freight services generally outpaced industry capacity in 2014 and into early 2015. The demand for freight services generally slowed in the later months of 2015 compared to 2014 levels and continued to slow significantly throughout 2016 as industry capacity outpaced freight demand. In 2016, shippers implemented significant bid activity, which resulted in pricing pressure throughout the year. We believe that our industry continues to be hindered by an insufficient quantity of qualified drivers which creates significant competition for this declining pool of qualified and safe drivers.
Pricing is expected to be more favorable during periods of more rapid economic expansion or lack of effective industry-wide trucking capacity. In December 2017, federal regulations are scheduled to mandate the use of ELD's across our industry. These devices are expected to reduce effective industry capacity by more strictly enforcing truck drivers’ hours of service, and thus miles that can be driven each day. Like most large carriers, we have used ELD's in our entire fleet for several years and have adapted our network and customer base to the utilization constraints. A substantial portion of industry capacity has not implemented ELD's, however, and we expect industry capacity to tighten after the regulation implementation date.
Safety and Risk Management
We are committed to promoting and maintaining a safe operation. Our safety program is designed to minimize accidents and to conduct our business within governmental safety regulations.  We communicate safety issues with drivers on a regular basis and emphasize safety through equipment specifications and regularly scheduled maintenance intervals.  Our drivers are compensated and recognized for achieving and maintaining a safe driving record.
The primary risks associated with our business include cargo loss and physical damage, personal injury, property damage, and workers’ compensation claims. We self-insure a portion of the exposure related to all of the aforementioned risks. Insurance coverage, including self-insurance retention levels, is evaluated on an annual basis. We actively participate in the settlement of each claim incurred.
We act as a self-insurer for auto liability involving property damage, personal injury, or cargo based on defined insurance retention of $0.5 million or $2.0 million for any individual claim based on the insured party and circumstances of the loss event. Liabilities in excess of these amounts, for any individual claim, are covered by insurance up to $100.0 million. We retain any liability in excess of $100.0 million. We act as a self-insurer for workers’ compensation liability of $0.5 million or $1.0 million for any 
5

individual claim based on the insured party and circumstances of the loss event. Liabilities in excess of this amount are covered by insurance. In addition, we maintain primary and excess coverage for employee health insurance and catastrophic physical damage coverage is carried to protect against natural disasters. Finally, we act as a self-insurer for any physical damage to our tractors and trailers.
Regulation
We are a common and contract motor carrier regulated by the DOT and various state and local agencies.  The DOT generally governs matters such as safety requirements, registration to engage in motor carrier operations, insurance requirements, and periodic financial reporting. Our Company drivers and independent contractors also must comply with the safety and fitness regulations of the DOT, including those relating to drug and alcohol testing and hours-of-service.  Such matters as weight and equipment dimensions are also subject to U.S. regulations.  We also may become subject to new or more restrictive regulations relating to fuel emissions, drivers' hours-of-service, ergonomics, or other matters affecting safety or operating methods.  Other agencies, such as the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") and the Department of Homeland Security ("DHS") also regulate our equipment, operations, and drivers.
The DOT, through the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (“FMCSA”), imposes safety and fitness regulations on us and our drivers, including rules that restrict driver hours-of-service.  In December 2011, the FMCSA published its 2011 Hours-of-Service Final Rule (the "2011 Rule"). The 2011 Rule requires drivers to take 30-minute breaks after eight hours of consecutive driving and reduces the total number of hours a driver is permitted to work during each week from 82 hours to 70 hours. The 2011 Rule also provides that the 34-hour restart may only be used once per week and must include two rest periods between one a.m. and five a.m. (together, the “2011 Restart Restrictions”). These rule changes became effective in July 2013. We believe the 2011 Rule led to decreased productivity and caused some loss of efficiency, as drivers and shippers needed supplemental training, computer programming required modifications, additional drivers were required, additional equipment has been acquired, and shipping lanes were reconfigured.
In December 2014, the 2015 Omnibus Appropriations bill was signed into law. Among other things, the legislation provided temporary relief from the 2011 Restart Restrictions while the FMCSA conducted a study to determine whether such restrictions had a positive result on driver safety (the “Study”), and essentially reverted to the more straightforward 34-hour restart rule that was in effect before the 2011 Rule became effective. In December 2016, a short-term funding bill was signed into law that directly ties the reinstatement of the 2011 Restart Restrictions to the outcome of the Study and requires the Study to demonstrate that the 2011 Restart Restrictions offer a “statistically significant improvement” in safety related matters in order for the 2011 Restart Restrictions to be reinstated. If the 2011 Restart Restrictions are reinstated, we may experience a decrease in production and loss of efficiency similar to that experienced during 2013 and 2014 when the 2011 Restart Restrictions were in effect.
There are two methods of evaluating the safety and fitness of carriers. The first method is the application of a safety rating that is based on an onsite investigation and affects a carrier’s ability to operate in interstate commerce. We currently have a satisfactory DOT safety rating under this method, which is the highest available rating under the current safety rating scale. If we received a conditional or unsatisfactory DOT safety rating, it could adversely affect our business, as some of our existing customer contracts require a satisfactory DOT safety rating. In January 2016, the FMCSA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking outlining a revised safety rating measurement system which would replace the current methodology. Under the proposed rule, the current three safety ratings of “satisfactory,” “conditional,” and “unsatisfactory” would be replaced with a single safety rating of “unfit.” Thus a carrier with no rating would be deemed fit. Moreover, data from roadside inspections and the results of all investigations would be used to determine a carrier’s fitness on an ongoing basis. This would replace the current methodology of determining a carrier’s fitness based solely on infrequent comprehensive onsite reviews. The proposed rule underwent a public comment period that ended in June 2016 and several industry groups and lawmakers expressed their disagreement with the proposed rule, arguing that it violates the requirements of the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act and that the FMCSA must first finalize its review of the CSA scoring system, described in further detail below. Based on this feedback, in January 2017, the FMCSA determined that a Supplemental Notice of Proposed Rulemaking outlining certain changes to the proposed rule would be released in the future. Therefore, it is uncertain if, when, or under what form this proposed rule could take effect. However, if this rule or a similar rule was enacted, and we received a rating of "unfit," it could materially adversely affect our operations.
In addition to the safety rating system, the FMCSA has adopted the Compliance Safety Accountability program (“CSA”) as an additional safety enforcement and compliance model that evaluates and ranks fleets on certain safety-related standards. The CSA program analyzes data from roadside inspections, moving violations, crash reports from the last two years, and investigation results. The data is organized into seven categories. Carriers are grouped by category with other carriers that have a similar number of safety events (e.g., crashes, inspections, or violations) and carriers are ranked and assigned a rating percentile to prioritize them for interventions if they are above a certain threshold. Currently, these scores do not have a direct impact on a carrier’s safety rating. However, the occurrence of unfavorable scores in one or more categories may (i) affect driver recruiting and retention by 
6

causing high-quality drivers to seek employment with other carriers, (ii) cause our customers to direct their business away from us and to carriers with higher fleet safety rankings (iii), subject us to an increase in compliance reviews and roadside inspections, or (iv) cause us to incur greater than expected expenses in our attempts to improve unfavorable scores, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and profitability.
Under CSA, these scores were initially made available to the public in five of the seven categories. However, pursuant to the FAST Act, which was signed into law in December 2015, the FMCSA is required to remove from public view the previously available CSA scores while it reviews the reliability of the scoring system. During this period of review by the FMCSA, we will continue to have access to our own scores and will still be subject to intervention by the FMCSA when such scores are above the intervention thresholds. We will continue to monitor our CSA scores and compliance through results from roadside inspections and other data available to detect positive or negative trends in compliance issues on an ongoing basis.
In 2011, the FMCSA issued new rules that would require nearly all carriers, including us, to install and use ELD's in their tractors to electronically monitor truck miles and enforce hours-of-service. These rules, however, were vacated by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in August 2011. In response, Congress passed legislation in July 2012 renewing the mandate, subject to new regulations to be promulgated by the DOT. Pursuant to its rulemaking authority, the FMCSA published a new final rule in December 2015 which requires the use of ELD's by nearly all carriers by December 2017 (the "2015 ELD Rule"). We have proactively installed ELD's on 100% of our tractor fleet, so we don’t believe the 2015 ELD Rule will impact our operations or profitability or our use of ELD's. Furthermore, we believe that more effective hours-of-service enforcement after the 2015 ELD Rule takes effect may improve our competitive position by causing all carriers to adhere more closely to hours-of-service requirements.
In the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the DHS and other federal, state, and municipal authorities implemented and continue to implement various security measures, including checkpoints and travel restrictions on large trucks. The U.S. Transportation Security Administration ("TSA") adopted regulations that require determination by the TSA that each driver who applies for or renews his or her license for carrying hazardous materials is not a security threat.  This could reduce the pool of qualified drivers who are permitted to transport hazardous waste, which could require us to increase driver compensation, limit our fleet growth, or allow trucks to sit idle.  These regulations also could complicate the matching of available equipment with hazardous material shipments, thereby increasing our response time on customer orders and our non-revenue miles.  As a result, it is possible we could fail to meet the needs of our customers or could incur increased expenses to do so. While transporting hazardous materials subjects us to a wide array of regulations, the number of hazardous material shipments we make is insignificant relative to our total number of shipments.
In November 2015, the FMCSA published its final rule related to driver coercion, which took effect in January 2016. Under this rule, carriers, shippers, receivers, or transportation intermediaries that are found to have coerced drivers to violate certain FMCSA regulations (including hours-of-service rules) may be fined up to $16,000 for each offense. In addition, other rules have been recently proposed or made final by the FMCSA, including (i) a rule requiring the use of speed limiting devices on heavy duty trucks to restrict maximum speeds, which was proposed in 2016 but has not yet been made final, (ii) a rule mandating the creation of a national clearinghouse that employers and prospective employers must query to determine if current or prospective drivers have had any drug/alcohol positives or refusals, which was made final in December 2016, with a compliance date in January 2020, and (iii) a rule setting forth minimum driver-training standards for new drivers applying for commercial driver licenses for the first time and to experienced drivers upgrading their licenses or seeking a hazmat endorsement, which was made final in December 2016, with a compliance date in February 2020. The effect of these recently proposed or finalized rules could be a decrease in fleet production and driver availability, either of which could adversely affect our business or operations. However, the recent executive order limiting new regulations issued by the Trump administration, described in further detail below, makes a voidance, repeal, or other change to many of these industry regulations a possibility, although it’s uncertain to what extent such regulatory changes may occur. 
In March 2014, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that California state wage and hour laws are not preempted by federal law. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, which in May 2015 refused to review the case, and accordingly, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision stands. Current and future state and local wage and hour laws, including laws related to employee meal breaks and rest periods, may vary significantly from federal law. As a result, we, along with other companies in the industry, could become subject to an uneven patchwork of wage and hour laws throughout the United States. There is proposed federal legislation to preempt state and local wage and hour laws; however, passage of such legislation is uncertain. If federal legislation is not passed, we will either need to comply with the most restrictive state and local laws across our entire network, or overhaul our management systems to comply with varying state and local laws. Either solution could result in increased compliance and labor costs, driver turnover, and decreased efficiency.
Tax and other regulatory authorities, as well as independent contractors themselves, have increasingly asserted that independent contractor drivers in the trucking industry are employees rather than independent contractors, for a variety of purposes, including 
7

income tax withholding, workers' compensation, wage and hour compensation, unemployment, and other issues. Federal legislators have introduced legislation in the past to make it easier for tax and other authorities to reclassify independent contractor drivers as employees, including legislation to increase the recordkeeping requirements for those that engage independent contractor drivers and to heighten the penalties of companies who misclassify their employees and are found to have violated employees' overtime and/or wage requirements. Additionally, federal legislators have sought to abolish the current safe harbor allowing taxpayers meeting certain criteria to treat individuals as independent contractors if they are following a long-standing, recognized practice, extend the Fair Labor Standards Act to independent contractors, and impose notice requirements based upon employment or independent contractor status and fines for failure to comply. Some states have put initiatives in place to increase their revenues from items such as unemployment, workers' compensation, and income taxes, and a reclassification of independent contractor drivers as employees would help states with this initiative. Further, class actions and other lawsuits have been filed against certain members of our industry seeking to reclassify independent contractors as employees for a variety of purposes, including workers' compensation and health care coverage. Taxing and other regulatory authorities and courts apply a variety of standards in their determination of independent contractor status. Our classification of independent contractors has been the subject of audits by such authorities from time to time. While we have been successful in continuing to classify our independent contractor drivers as independent contractors and not employees, we may be unsuccessful in defending that position in the future. If our independent contractor drivers are determined to be our employees, we would incur additional exposure under federal and state tax, workers' compensation, unemployment benefits, labor, employment, and tort laws, including for prior periods, as well as potential liability for employee benefits and tax withholdings. Our use of independent contractors is not significant to our total operations.
We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the hauling and handling of hazardous materials, fuel storage tanks, air emissions from our vehicles and facilities, engine idling, and discharge and retention of storm water. Our truck terminals often are located in industrial areas where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination could occur. Our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage, environmental damage, and hazardous waste disposal, among others. Certain facilities have waste oil or fuel storage tanks and fueling islands. We do not know of any environmental regulations that would have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. Additionally, increasing efforts to control emissions of greenhouse gases may have an adverse effect on us. Although we have instituted programs to monitor and control environmental risks and promote compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, if we are involved in a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances, if there are releases of hazardous substances we transport, if soil or groundwater contamination is found at our facilities or results from our operations, or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to cleanup costs and liabilities, including substantial fines or penalties or civil and criminal liability, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results.
EPA regulations limiting exhaust emissions became more restrictive in 2010. In 2010, an executive memorandum was signed directing the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (the "NHTSA") and the EPA to develop new, stricter fuel efficiency standards for heavy trucks. In August 2011, the NHTSA and the EPA adopted final rules that established the first-ever fuel economy and greenhouse gas standards for medium-and heavy-duty vehicles (the “Phase 1 Standards”). The Phase 1 Standards apply to tractor model years 2014 to 2018 and require the achievement of an approximate 20 percent reduction in fuel consumption by the 2018 model year, which equates to approximately four gallons of fuel for every 100 miles traveled. In addition, in February 2014, President Obama announced that his administration would begin developing the next phase of tighter fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas standards for medium-and heavy-duty trucks and trailers (the “Phase 2 Standards”). In October 2016, the EPA and NHTSA published the final rule mandating that the Phase 2 Standards will apply to trailers beginning with model year 2018 and tractors beginning with model year 2021. The Phase 2 Standards require nine percent and 25 percent reductions in emissions and fuel consumption for trailers and tractors, respectively, by 2027. We believe these requirements will result in additional increases in new tractor and trailer prices and additional parts and maintenance costs incurred to retrofit our tractors and trailers with technology to achieve compliance with such standards, which could adversely affect our operating results and profitability, particularly if such costs are not offset by potential fuel savings. We cannot predict, however, the extent to which our operations and productivity will be impacted. 
The California Air Resources Board ("CARB") also adopted emission control regulations that will be applicable to all heavy-duty tractors that pull 53-foot or longer box-type trailers within the State of California. The tractors and trailers subject to these CARB regulations must be either EPA SmartWay certified or equipped with low-rolling resistance tires and retrofitted with SmartWay-approved aerodynamic technologies. Enforcement of these CARB regulations for model year 2011 equipment began in January 2010 and will be phased in over several years for older equipment. In addition, CARB has announced that it expects to propose California Phase 2 Standards sometime in 2017, which will set stricter requirements that the federal Phase 2 Standards. Federal and state lawmakers also are considering a variety of other climate-change proposals. Compliance with such regulations could increase the cost of new tractors and trailers, impair equipment productivity, and increase operating expenses. These effects, combined with the uncertainty as to the operating results that will be produced by the newly designed diesel engines and the residual values of these vehicles, could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business or operations.

In order to reduce exhaust emissions, some states and municipalities have begun to restrict the locations and amount of time where diesel-powered tractors may idle. These restrictions could force us to purchase on-board power units that do not require the engine to idle or to alter our drivers' behavior, which could result in a decrease in productivity or increase in driver turnover.
The regulatory environment has recently changed under the administration of President Trump. In January 2017, the President’s office issued a temporary moratorium on proposed and recently published regulations, which will delay the effectiveness of such regulations for at least 60 days. Additionally, in January 2017, the President signed an executive order requiring federal agencies to repeal two regulations for each new one they propose and imposing a regulatory budget, which would limit the amount of new regulatory costs federal agencies can impose on individuals and businesses each year. The impact of these actions by the Trump administration may inhibit future new regulations and/or lead to the repeal or delayed effectiveness of existing regulations. Therefore, it is uncertain how we may be impacted in the future by existing or proposed regulations.
