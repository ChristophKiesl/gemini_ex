2019 Acquisition
On November 5, 2018 (the "Acquisition Date"), the Company completed the acquisition (the "Acquisition") of 33 reinforcing bar ("rebar") fabrication facilities in the U.S., as well as four EAF mini mills located in Knoxville, Tennessee, Jacksonville, Florida, Sayreville, New Jersey and Rancho Cucamonga, California from Gerdau S.A., hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Acquired Businesses." For further details, refer to Note 2, Changes in Business, in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.
Segments
The Company has two operating and reportable segments: North America and Europe. 
NORTH AMERICA SEGMENT
Our North America segment is a vertically integrated network of recycling facilities, steel mills and fabrication operations. Our strategy in North America is to optimize our vertically integrated value chain to maximize profitability. To execute our strategy, we seek to (i) obtain the lowest possible input costs, primarily from our recycling facilities that we operate to provide low-cost scrap to our steel mills, (ii) operate modern, efficient EAF steel mills and (iii) enhance operational efficiency by utilizing our 
fabrication operations to optimize our steel mill volumes and obtain the highest possible selling prices to maximize metal margin. We strive to maximize cash flow generation through increased productivity, high capacity utilization and optimal product mix. To remain competitive, we regularly make substantial capital expenditures. We have invested approximately 73%, 68% and 64% of our total capital expenditures in our North America segment during 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. For logistics, we utilize a fleet of trucks we own or lease as well as private haulers, railcars, export containers and barges.
Our 38 scrap metal recycling facilities, primarily located in the southeast and central U.S., process ferrous and nonferrous scrap metals. These facilities purchase processed and unprocessed ferrous and nonferrous metals from a variety of sources including manufacturing and industrial plants, metal fabrication plants, electric utilities, machine shops, factories, refineries, shipyards, demolition businesses, automobile salvage firms, wrecking companies and retail individuals. Our recycling facilities utilize specialized equipment to efficiently process large volumes of ferrous material, including seven large machines capable of shredding obsolete automobiles or other sources of scrap metal. Certain facilities also have nonferrous downstream equipment, including extensive equipment at three of our facilities that reclaim metal from insulated copper wire, to allow us to capture more metal content. With the exception of precious metals, our scrap metal processing facilities recycle and process almost all types of metal. We sell ferrous and nonferrous scrap metals (collectively referred to as "raw materials") to steel mills and foundries, aluminum sheet and ingot manufacturers, brass and bronze ingot makers, copper refineries and mills, secondary lead smelters, specialty steel mills, high temperature alloy manufacturers and other consumers. Raw materials margin per ton is defined as the difference between the selling prices for processed and recycled ferrous and nonferrous scrap metals and the price paid to purchase obsolete and industrial scrap. Raw material sales in our North America segment accounted for 17%, 13% and 16% of consolidated net sales in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Our steel mill operations consist of six EAF mini mills, two EAF micro mills and one rerolling mill. Our steel mills manufacture finished long steel products including rebar, merchant bar, light structural and other special sections as well as semi-finished billets for rerolling and forging applications (collectively referred to as "steel products"). Each EAF mini mill consists of:
•a melt shop with an electric arc furnace;
•continuous casting equipment that shapes molten metal into billets;
•a reheating furnace that prepares billets for rolling;
•a rolling line that forms products from heated billets;
•a mechanical cooling bed that receives hot products from the rolling line;
•finishing facilities that shear, straighten, bundle and prepare products for shipping; and
•supporting facilities such as maintenance, warehouse and office areas.
Our EAF micro mills utilize similar equipment and processes as described above; however, these facilities utilize unique continuous process technology where metal flows uninterrupted from melting to casting to rolling. Our rerolling mill does not utilize a melt shop; the rerolling process begins by reheating billets to roll into finished steel products. In addition, CMC has three facilities capable of producing spooled rebar. The estimated annual capacity for our steel mills, included in Item 2, "Properties," assumes a typical product mix and does not represent the quantity of likely production or shipments in each fiscal year. Descriptions of mill capacity, particularly rolling capacity, are highly dependent on the specific product mix manufactured. Our mills roll many different types and sizes of products depending on market conditions, including pricing and demand. 
In August 2020, we announced the construction of a third micro mill in Mesa, Arizona. This micro mill will be the first in the world to produce merchant bar quality products through a continuous production process, and will employ the latest technology in EAF power supply systems which will allow us to directly connect the EAF and the ladle furnace to renewable energy sources such as solar and wind. The new facility will replace the rebar capacity at our Rancho Cucamonga, California mill, which was classified as held for sale as of August 31, 2021, and will allow us to more efficiently meet West Coast demand for steel products. We began construction of the third micro mill in 2021 and expect this micro mill to startup in 2023. For further details on the classification of the Rancho Cucamonga, California mill, refer to Note 2, Changes in Business, in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.
Ferrous scrap is the primary raw material used by our steel mills. While ferrous scrap is subject to significant price fluctuations, we believe the supply is adequate to meet our future needs. Our mills consume large amounts of electricity and natural gas. We have not had any significant curtailments, and we believe that energy supplies are adequate. The supply and demand of regional and national energy, and the extent of applicable regulatory oversight of rates charged by providers, affect the prices we pay for electricity and natural gas. Our mills ship to a broad range of customers and end markets across the U.S. The primary end markets are construction and fabricating industries, metals service centers, original equipment manufacturers and agricultural, energy and petrochemical industries. Steel products sales in our North America segment accounted for 34%, 32% and 30% of consolidated net sales in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Due to the nature of our steel products, we do not have a long lead 
time between order receipt and delivery. We generally fill orders for steel products from inventory or with products near completion. As a result, we do not believe our steel products backlog is a significant factor in the evaluation of our North America operations. 
Our fabrication operations include 57 facilities engaged in various aspects of steel fabrication. Most of these facilities engage in general fabrication of reinforcing steel. Four of these facilities fabricate steel fence posts. Our fabricated rebar and steel fence posts (collectively referred to as "downstream products") operations shear, bend, weld and fabricate steel. Fabricated rebar is used to reinforce concrete primarily in the construction of commercial and non-commercial buildings, hospitals, convention centers, industrial plants, power plants, highways, bridges, arenas, stadiums and dams, and is generally sold in response to a competitive bid solicitation. Many of the resulting projects are fixed price over the life of the project. We also provide installation services in certain markets. We obtain steel for our fabrication operations primarily from our own steel mills, and the demand created by our fabrication operations optimizes the production from our steel mills. 
Downstream products sales in our North America segment accounted for 27%, 35% and 33% of consolidated net sales in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Downstream products backlog, defined as the total value of unfulfilled orders, was $1.5 billion and $1.1 billion at August 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
We also operate Construction Services and CMC Impact Metals businesses. Our Construction Services business sells and rents construction-related products and equipment to concrete installers and other businesses in the construction industry. CMC Impact Metals manufactures high strength bar for the truck trailer industry, special bar quality steel for the energy market and armor plate for military vehicles and is one of North America's premier producers of high strength steel products.
EUROPE SEGMENT
Our Europe segment is a vertically integrated network of recycling facilities, an EAF mini mill and fabrication operations located in Poland. Our strategy in Europe is to optimize profitability of the products manufactured by our mini mill, and we execute this strategy in the same way in our Europe segment as we do in our North America segment. 
Our 12 scrap metal recycling facilities, located throughout Poland, process ferrous scrap metals for use as a raw material for our mini mill. These facilities provide material almost exclusively to our mini mill and operate in order to lower the cost of scrap used by our mini mill. The equipment utilized at these facilities is similar to our North America recycling operations and includes one large capacity scrap metal shredding facility similar to the largest shredder we operate in North America. Nonferrous scrap metal is not material to this segment’s operations.
Our mini mill is a significant manufacturer of steel products including rebar, merchant bar and wire rod in Central Europe and consists of three rolling lines. The third rolling line startup, which occurred in late 2021, takes advantage of historical excess melting capacity, expands our overall rolling capacity and allows the rolling lines to now operate independently for each steel product type. The first rolling line is designed to allow efficient and flexible production of a range of medium section merchant bar products. The second rolling line is dedicated primarily to rebar production. The third rolling line is designed to produce high grade wire rod. Our mini mill sells steel products primarily to fabricators, manufacturers, distributors and construction companies, mostly to customers located within Poland. However, the mini mill also exports steel products to the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Slovakia and other countries. Ferrous metal, the principal raw material used by our mini mill, electricity, natural gas and other necessary raw materials for the steel manufacturing process are generally readily available, although they can be subject to significant price fluctuations. Steel products sales in our Europe segment accounted for 12%, 10% and 11% of consolidated net sales in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Our fabrication operations consist of five steel fabrication facilities located in Poland which produce downstream products, primarily fabricated rebar and wire mesh. Three of our facilities have expanded captive uses for a portion of the rebar and wire rod manufactured at the mini mill. They are similar to the facilities operated by our North America segment and sell fabricated rebar primarily to contractors for incorporation into construction projects. In addition to fabricated rebar, our fabrication operations sell other downstream products including fabricated mesh, assembled rebar cages and other fabricated rebar by-products. Additionally, we operate two other fabrication facilities in Poland that produce welded steel mesh, cold rolled wire rod and cold rolled rebar. These facilities supplement sales of fabricated rebar by offering wire mesh to customers, which include metals service centers and construction contractors. We are among the largest manufacturers of wire mesh in Poland. In addition to sales of downstream products in the Polish market, we also export our downstream products to neighboring countries such as the Czech Republic, Germany and Slovakia.
Our mini mill generally fills orders for steel products from inventory or with products near completion. As a result, we do not believe that backlog levels are a significant factor in evaluating the operations of our Europe segment. 
SEASONALITY
Many of our facilities serve customers in the construction industry. Due to the increase in construction activities during the spring and summer months, our net sales are generally higher in our third and fourth quarters than in our first and second quarters.
COMPETITION
Our North America and Europe segments compete with national and international scrap metal processors and primary nonferrous metal producers and local, regional, national and international manufacturers and suppliers of steel. We compete primarily on the services we provide to our customers and on the quality and price of our products. The nonferrous recycling industry is highly fragmented in the U.S.; however, we believe our recycling operations are among the largest engaged in the recycling of nonferrous metals in the U.S. We are also a major regional processor of ferrous metal. We produce a significant percentage of the total U.S. output of rebar and merchant bar. We also believe we are the largest manufacturer, and among the largest fabricators, of rebar in the U.S., as well as the largest manufacturer of steel fence posts in the U.S. In Poland, we believe we are the largest producer of merchant bars for the products we produce and the second largest producer of rebar and wire rod.
See Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business" of this Annual Report.
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
A significant factor in our business is our compliance with environmental laws and regulations. See Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors — Risks Related to the Regulatory Environment" in this Annual Report. Compliance with and changes to various environmental requirements and environmental risks applicable to our industry may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Occasionally, we may be required to clean up or take remedial action with regard to sites we operate or formerly operated. We may also be required to pay for a portion of the cleanup or remediation cost at sites we never owned or at sites which we never operated, if we are found to have arranged for treatment or disposal of hazardous substances on the sites. Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA" or "Superfund") and analogous state statutes, we could be responsible for both the costs of cleanup as well as for associated natural resource damages. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"), or equivalent state agency, has named us as a potentially responsible party ("PRP") at several federal Superfund sites or similar state sites. In some cases, these agencies allege that we are one of many PRPs responsible for the cleanup of a site because we sold scrap metals to, or otherwise disposed of materials at, the site. With respect to the sale of scrap metals, we contend that an arm's length sale of valuable scrap metal for use as a raw material in a manufacturing process that we do not control should not constitute "an arrangement for disposal or treatment of hazardous substances" as defined under federal law. Subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, the Superfund Recycling Equity Act provides legitimate sellers of scrap metal for recycling with some relief from Superfund liability under federal law. Despite Congress' clarification of the intent of the federal law, some state laws and environmental agencies still seek to impose liability on the basis of such arm's length sale constituting "an arrangement for disposal or treatment of hazardous substances." We believe efforts to impose such liability are contrary to public policy objectives and legislation encouraging recycling and promoting the use of recycled materials, and we continue to support clarification of state laws and regulations consistent with Congress' action.
New federal, state and local laws, regulations, foreign laws, with respect to our Polish operations, and the varying interpretations of such laws by regulatory agencies and the judiciary impact how much money we spend on environmental compliance. In addition, uncertainty regarding adequate control levels, testing and sampling procedures, new pollution control technology and cost benefit analysis based on market conditions impact our future expenditures in order to comply with environmental requirements. We cannot predict the total amount of capital expenditures or increases in operating costs or other expenses that may be required as a result of environmental compliance. We also do not know if we can pass such costs on to our customers through product price increases. During 2021, we incurred environmental costs, including disposal, permits, license fees, tests, studies, remediation, consultant fees and environmental personnel expense of $49.8 million. In addition, we spent $3.1 million on capital expenditures for environmental projects in 2021. We believe that our facilities are in material compliance with currently applicable environmental laws and regulations. We anticipate capital expenditures for new environmental projects during 2022 to be approximately $6.2 million.
EMPLOYEES AND WORKFORCE CULTURE
Our employees are our most important asset and are fundamental to our success. We recognize that each employee brings a diverse background and a unique skill set, and have fostered a culture that challenges conventional thinking, promotes teamwork, requires accountability and rewards success. At the heart of our culture are our core values of Integrity, Safety, Collaboration and Excellence. These core values are reinforced daily through our actions and in meetings with employees and serve as a compass for our behaviors and decisions.
The following table presents the approximate headcount of employees within each reportable segment and Corporate and Other as of August 31, 2021:

Segment | Number of Employees
North America | 8,196 
Europe | 2,540 
Corporate and Other | 353 
Total | 11,089 

Approximately 16% and 30% of the employees in our North America and Europe segments, respectively, belong to unions. We believe that we have good relations with the union representatives that represent our employees and are focused on providing safe and productive workplace environments for our employees. 
Ethics and Compliance
At CMC, we believe “it’s what’s inside that counts.” It is fundamental to our success that both our leaders and employees observe the highest ethical standards of business conduct in their interactions with our customers, suppliers, communities, investors and each other. We empower our employees to make the right decisions, and have established the CMC Code of Conduct and Business Ethics (the “Code”) to help our employees understand company policies and guide their actions. Employees are required to complete training to reinforce their continued understanding of and compliance with the Code. Additionally, to foster and maintain our culture of ethical conduct and integrity, we provide confidential channels for employees to report known and suspected violations of applicable laws, the Code, our policies or our internal controls, and receive a response to such reports.
Employee Health and Safety
The safety of every employee is, and has always been, our top priority. We strive to provide a safe working environment where facilities achieve zero work related injuries or illnesses. In pursuit of our goal of zero incidents, we embrace a total safety culture that encourages our employees to recognize potentially unsafe situations and use our Proactive Safety Program to report concerns and work together to remove potential hazards from the work environment before incidents occur. Additionally, our Global Health and Safety Policy sets the standard for our facilities based on best practices that often exceed regulatory requirements and all of our employees are provided with the training necessary to safely and effectively perform their responsibilities. 
Our Safety Management System includes our policies, incident management process, data dashboards and safety action plans based on observed behaviors related to health and safety. We periodically issue employee Safety Perception Surveys at various locations and across business groups to identify any discrepancies between management and employee perspectives on the safety of our working conditions. Additionally, we participate in industry association meetings to share expertise and best practices. These surveys and meetings facilitate important discussions that ultimately help further develop our health and safety management systems. Our commitment to safety has resulted in the achievement of a lower total recordable incident rate ("TRIR") in comparison to the industry average: 
__________________________________
(1) TRIR is defined as OSHA recordable incidents x 200,000/hours worked.
(2) --- Represents the 2019 average for Steel Product Manufacturing (North American Industry Classification System ("NAICS") code 3311), based on information provided by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
In addition to TRIR, we also measure our near miss frequency rate, which we believe is critical to incident avoidance and supports our superior safety rating in the industry.
Talent Development and Retention
We invest in training and resources to support our employees in reaching their full potential and to build internal capabilities, and are committed to providing a safe, welcoming and stimulating work environment to attract and retain talent. In addition to our internally developed technical, safety and leadership training available to all employees, new employees in commercial and operational positions complete rotational programs during onboarding to gain technical experience across the business. We also conduct periodic surveys and other initiatives with employees, which provide invaluable information about how employees perceive our onboarding, employee training, development and culture.
