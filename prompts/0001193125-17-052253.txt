Health Care Facilities 
 We currently own, manage or operate hospitals, freestanding surgery centers, freestanding emergency care facilities, urgent care facilities, walk-in clinics, diagnostic and imaging centers, radiation and oncology therapy centers, comprehensive rehabilitation and physical therapy centers, physician practices and various other facilities. 
 At December 31, 2016, we owned and operated 166 general, acute care hospitals with 43,778 licensed beds. Most of our general, acute care hospitals provide medical and surgical services, including inpatient care, intensive care, cardiac care, diagnostic services and emergency services. The general, acute care hospitals also provide outpatient services such as outpatient surgery, laboratory, radiology, respiratory therapy, cardiology and physical therapy. Each hospital has an organized medical staff and a local board of trustees or governing board, made up of members of the local community. 
 At December 31, 2016, we operated three psychiatric hospitals with 412 licensed beds. Our psychiatric hospitals provide therapeutic programs including child, adolescent and adult psychiatric care, adolescent and adult alcohol and drug abuse treatment and counseling. 
 We also operate outpatient health care facilities, which include freestanding ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs), freestanding emergency care facilities, urgent care facilities, walk-in clinics, diagnostic and imaging centers, comprehensive rehabilitation and physical therapy centers, radiation and oncology therapy centers, physician practices and various other facilities. These outpatient services are an integral component of our strategy to develop comprehensive health care networks in select communities. Most of our ASCs are operated through partnerships or limited liability companies, with majority ownership of each partnership or limited liability company typically held by a general partner or member that is an affiliate of HCA. 
 Certain of our affiliates provide a variety of management services to our health care facilities, including patient safety programs, ethics and compliance programs, national supply contracts, equipment purchasing and leasing contracts, accounting, financial and clinical systems, governmental reimbursement assistance, construction planning and coordination, information technology systems and solutions, legal counsel, human resources services and internal audit services. 
 Sources of Revenue 
 Hospital revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels, the medical and ancillary services ordered by physicians and provided to patients, the volume of outpatient procedures and the charges or payment rates for such services. Charges and reimbursement rates for inpatient services vary significantly depending on the type of payer, the type of service (e.g., medical/surgical, intensive care or psychiatric) and the geographic location of the hospital. Inpatient occupancy levels fluctuate for various reasons, many of which are beyond our control. 
 
4 
 
We receive payments for patient services from the federal government under the Medicare program, state governments under their respective Medicaid or similar programs, managed care plans (including plans offered through the American Health Benefit Exchanges (Exchanges)), private insurers and directly from patients. Our revenues from third-party payers, the uninsured and other for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 are summarized in the following table (dollars in millions):

 Medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and medical insurance benefits to persons age 65 and over, some disabled persons, persons with end-stage renal disease and persons with Lou Gehrigs Disease. Medicaid is a federal-state program, administered by the states, which provides hospital and medical benefits to qualifying individuals who are unable to afford health care. All of our general, acute care hospitals located in the United States are eligible to participate in Medicare and Medicaid programs. Amounts received under Medicare and Medicaid programs are generally significantly less than established hospital gross charges for the services provided. 
 Our hospitals generally offer discounts from established charges to certain group purchasers of health care services, including private insurance companies, employers, health maintenance organizations (HMOs), preferred provider organizations (PPOs) and other managed care plans, including plans offered through the Exchanges. These discount programs generally limit our ability to increase revenues in response to increasing costs. See Item 1, Business  Competition. Patients are generally not responsible for the total difference between established hospital gross charges and amounts reimbursed for such services under Medicare, Medicaid, HMOs, PPOs and other managed care plans, but are responsible to the extent of any exclusions, deductibles or coinsurance features of their coverage. The amount of such exclusions, deductibles and coinsurance continues to increase. Collection of amounts due from individuals is typically more difficult than from governmental or third-party payers. We provide discounts to uninsured patients who do not qualify for Medicaid or charity care under our charity care policy. In implementing our uninsured discount policy, we may attempt to provide assistance to uninsured patients to help determine whether they may qualify for Medicaid, other federal or state assistance or charity care under our charity care policy. If an uninsured patient does not qualify for these programs, the uninsured discount is applied. 
 Medicare 
 In addition to the reimbursement reductions and adjustments discussed below, the Budget Control Act of 2011 (the BCA) requires automatic spending reductions to reduce the federal deficit, including Medicare spending reductions of up to 2% per fiscal year, with a uniform percentage reduction across all Medicare programs. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) began imposing a 2% reduction on Medicare claims in April 1, 2013. These reductions have been extended through 2025. 
 
5 
 
Inpatient Acute Care 
 Under the Medicare program, we receive reimbursement under a prospective payment system (PPS) for general, acute care hospital inpatient services. Under the hospital inpatient PPS, fixed payment amounts per inpatient discharge are established based on the patients assigned Medicare severity diagnosis-related group (MS-DRG). MS-DRGs classify treatments for illnesses according to the estimated intensity of hospital resources necessary to furnish care for each principal diagnosis. MS-DRG weights represent the average resources for a given MS-DRG relative to the average resources for all MS-DRGs. MS-DRG payments are adjusted for area wage differentials. Hospitals, other than those defined as new, receive PPS reimbursement for inpatient capital costs based on MS-DRG weights multiplied by a geographically adjusted federal rate. When the cost to treat certain patients falls well outside the normal distribution, providers typically receive additional outlier payments. 
 MS-DRG rates are updated, and MS-DRG weights are recalibrated, using cost-relative weights each federal fiscal year (which begins October 1). The index used to update the MS-DRG rates (the market basket) gives consideration to the inflation experienced by hospitals and entities outside the health care industry in purchasing goods and services. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the Health Reform Law), provides for annual decreases to the market basket, including reductions of 0.75% for each of federal fiscal years 2017, 2018 and 2019. For each federal fiscal year, the Health Reform Law provides for the annual market basket update to be further reduced by a productivity adjustment based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) 10-year moving average of changes in specified economy-wide productivity. In addition, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 requires negative documentation and coding adjustments for four years beginning in federal fiscal year 2014. CMS estimated in 2016 that, over the four years, these documentation and coding adjustments will reduce Medicare inpatient PPS payments by $11.2 billion. A decrease in payment rates or an increase in rates that is below the increase in our costs may adversely affect our results of operations. 
 For federal fiscal year 2016, CMS increased the MS-DRG rate by 0.9%. This increase reflected a 2.4% market basket increase, the 0.2% reduction required by the Health Reform Law, a negative 0.5% productivity adjustment, and a negative 0.8% prospective documentation and coding adjustment. For federal fiscal year 2017, CMS increased the MS-DRG rate by 0.95%. This increase reflects a 2.7% market basket increase, the 0.75% reduction required by the Health Reform Law, a negative 0.3% productivity adjustment, and a prospective reduction of 1.5% for documentation and coding. It also reflects a positive adjustment of approximately 0.8% to remove the effects of prior adjustments intended to offset the estimated increase in inpatient PPS expenditures resulting from the Medicare programs two midnight rule. 
 Under the two midnight rule, services provided to Medicare beneficiaries are only payable as inpatient hospital services when there is a reasonable expectation that the hospital care is medically necessary and will be required across two midnights, absent unusual circumstances. Stays expected to need less than two midnights of hospital care are subject to medical review on a case-by-case basis. Quality Improvement Organizations (QIOs) are handling the reviews of short inpatient stays and refer claim denials to Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) for payment adjustments. Providers that exhibit persistent noncompliance with the two midnight rule may be referred to a Recovery Audit Contractor (RAC). 
 CMS has implemented, or is implementing, a number of programs and requirements intended to transform Medicare from a passive payer to an active purchaser of quality goods and services. For example, hospitals that do not successfully participate in the Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting Program are subject to an additional 0.25% reduction of the market basket update. Hospitals that do not demonstrate meaningful use of electronic health records (EHRs) are subject to an additional 0.75% reduction of the market basket update in federal fiscal year 2017. 
 
6 
 
Medicare does not allow an inpatient hospital discharge to be assigned to a higher paying MS-DRG if a selected hospital acquired condition (HAC) was not present on admission and it is the only condition resulting in the assignment of the higher paying MS-DRG. In this situation, the case is paid as though the secondary diagnosis was not present. There are currently 14 categories of conditions on the list of HACs. In addition, CMS has established three National Coverage Determinations that prohibit Medicare reimbursement for erroneous surgical procedures performed on an inpatient or outpatient basis. Pursuant to the Health Reform Law, the 25% of hospitals with the worst risk-adjusted HAC rates in the designated performance period receive a 1% reduction in their inpatient PPS Medicare payments. 
 The Health Reform Law also provides for reduced payments to hospitals based on readmission rates. Each federal fiscal year inpatient payments are reduced if a hospital experiences excess readmissions within the 30-day time period from the date of discharge for conditions designated by CMS. For federal fiscal year 2017, CMS has designated seven conditions, including heart attack, pneumonia and total hip arthroplasty. Hospitals with what CMS defines as excess readmissions for these conditions receive reduced payments for all inpatient discharges, not just discharges relating to the conditions subject to the excess readmission standard. The amount by which payments are reduced is determined by comparing the hospitals performance for each condition using three years of discharge data to a risk-adjusted national average, subject to a cap established by CMS. The reduction in payments to hospitals with excess readmissions can be up to 3% for federal fiscal 2015 and subsequent years. Each hospitals performance is publicly reported by CMS. 
 The Health Reform Law additionally establishes a hospital value-based purchasing program to further link payments to quality and efficiency. For federal fiscal year 2017 and subsequent years, CMS will reduce the inpatient PPS payment amount for all discharges by 2.00%. The total amount collected from these reductions is pooled and used to fund payments to reward hospitals that meet certain quality performance standards established by CMS. CMS scores each hospital based on achievement (relative to other hospitals) and improvement ranges (relative to the hospitals own past performance) for each applicable performance standard. Because the Health Reform Law provides that the pool will be fully distributed, hospitals that meet or exceed the quality performance standards receive greater reimbursement under the value-based purchasing program than they would have otherwise. Hospitals that do not achieve the necessary quality performance receive reduced Medicare inpatient hospital payments. Hospitals are scored on a number of individual measures that are categorized into four domains: clinical care; efficiency and cost reduction; safety and patient and caregiver experience of care. CMS estimates that $1.8 billion will be available to hospitals as incentive payments in federal fiscal year 2017 under the value-based purchasing program. 
 Historically, the Medicare program has set aside 5.10% of Medicare inpatient payments to pay for outlier cases. For federal fiscal year 2016, CMS established an outlier threshold of $22,539, and for federal fiscal year 2017, CMS increased the outlier threshold to $23,573. 
 Outpatient 
 CMS reimburses hospital outpatient services (and certain Medicare Part B services furnished to hospital inpatients who have no Part A coverage) on a PPS basis. CMS uses fee schedules to pay for physical, occupational and speech therapies, durable medical equipment, clinical diagnostic laboratory services, nonimplantable orthotics and prosthetics, freestanding surgery center services and services provided by independent diagnostic testing facilities. 
 Hospital outpatient services paid under PPS are classified into groups called ambulatory payment classifications (APCs). Services for each APC are similar clinically and in terms of the resources they require. A payment rate is established for each APC. Depending on the services provided, a hospital may be paid for more than one APC for a patient visit. The APC payment rates are updated for each calendar year. The Health Reform Law provides for annual reductions of 0.75% to the market basket update in calendar years 2017, 2018 and 2019. For each calendar year, the Health Reform Law provides for the annual market basket update to be 
 
7 
 
 further reduced by a productivity adjustment based on the BLS 10-year moving average of changes in specified economy-wide productivity. For calendar year 2016, CMS decreased APC payment rates by an estimated 0.4%, which represented the market basket update of 2.4%, a negative 0.5% productivity adjustment and the negative 0.2% adjustment required by the Health Reform Law. The rate also reflected other payment adjustments, including a 2.0% reduction to address what CMS viewed as inflated payments in past years for laboratory tests packaged with payments for hospital outpatient services. For calendar year 2017, CMS has issued a final rule that it estimates will result in a 1.7% increase in payments for hospital outpatient services. The change is based on a market basket increase of 2.7%, a negative 0.3% productivity adjustment and the negative 0.75% adjustment required by the Health Reform Law, along with other payment adjustments. CMS requires hospitals to submit quality data relating to outpatient care to avoid receiving a 2% reduction to the market basket update under the outpatient PPS. 
 Rehabilitation 
 CMS reimburses inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRFs) on a PPS basis. Under the IRF PPS, patients are classified into case mix groups based upon impairment, age, comorbidities (additional diseases or disorders from which the patient suffers) and functional capability. IRFs are paid a predetermined amount per discharge that reflects the patients case mix group and is adjusted for area wage levels, low-income patients, rural areas and high-cost outliers. The Health Reform Law also provides for reductions to the market basket update, including annual reductions of 0.75% in federal fiscal years 2017, 2018 and 2019. For each federal fiscal year, the Health Reform Law provides for the annual market basket update to be further reduced by a productivity adjustment based on the BLS 10-year moving average of changes in specified economy-wide productivity. For federal fiscal year 2016, CMS updated inpatient rehabilitation rates 1.8%, which reflected a new inpatient rehabilitation-specific 2.4% market basket increase, a negative 0.5% productivity adjustment, a 0.2% reduction required by the Health Reform Law and a 0.1% increase to aggregate payments due to updating the outlier threshold. For federal fiscal year 2017, CMS increased inpatient rehabilitation payment rates by an estimated 1.9%, which reflects an increase of 2.7% to the IRF-specific market basket, a negative 0.3% productivity adjustment, the 0.75% reduction required by the Health Reform Law, among other payment adjustments. In addition, CMS requires IRFs to report quality measures to avoid receiving a 2% reduction to the market basket update. 
 In order to qualify for classification as an IRF, at least 60% of a facilitys inpatients during the most recent 12-month CMS-defined review period must have required intensive rehabilitation services for one or more of 13 specified conditions. IRFs must also meet additional coverage criteria, including patient selection and care requirements relating to pre-admission screenings, post-admission evaluations, ongoing coordination of care and involvement of rehabilitation physicians. A facility that fails to meet the 60% threshold, or other criteria to be classified as an IRF, will be paid under either the acute care hospital inpatient or outpatient PPS, which generally provide for lower payment amounts. As of December 31, 2016, we had one rehabilitation hospital and 53 hospital rehabilitation units. 
Psychiatric 
 Inpatient hospital services furnished in psychiatric hospitals and psychiatric units of general, acute care hospitals and critical access hospitals are reimbursed on a PPS basis (the IPF PPS), which is based upon a per diem payment, with adjustments to account for certain patient and facility characteristics. The IPF PPS contains an outlier policy for extraordinarily costly cases and an adjustment to a facilitys base payment if it maintains a full-service emergency department. CMS has established the IPF PPS payment rate in a manner intended to be budget neutral. The rehabilitation, psychiatric and long-term care market basket update is used to update the IPF PPS. The Health Reform Law also provides for reductions to the market basket update, including reductions of 0.2% in federal fiscal year 2017 and 0.75% in federal fiscal years 2018, 2019 and 2020. For each payment year, the Health Reform Law provides for the annual market basket update to be further reduced by a productivity adjustment based on the BLS 10-year moving average of changes in specified economy-wide productivity. For federal fiscal year 2016, CMS increased inpatient psychiatric payment rates by 1.5%, which reflected a new 
 
8 
 
 inpatient psychiatric-specific market basket increase of 2.4%, reduced by a 0.5% productivity adjustment and by 0.2% as required by the Health Reform Law, along with other payment adjustments. For federal fiscal year 2017, CMS increased inpatient psychiatric payment rates by an estimated 2.2%, which reflects an increase of 2.8% to the inpatient psychiatric-specific market basket, reduced by a 0.3% productivity adjustment and by 0.2% as required by the Health Reform Law, among other payment adjustments. Inpatient psychiatric facilities are required to report quality measures to CMS to avoid receiving a 2% reduction to the market basket update. As of December 31, 2016, we had three psychiatric hospitals and 54 hospital psychiatric units. 
 Ambulatory Surgery Centers 
 CMS reimburses ASCs using a predetermined fee schedule. Reimbursements for ASC overhead costs are limited to no more than the overhead costs paid to hospital outpatient departments under the Medicare hospital outpatient PPS for the same procedure. If CMS determines that a procedure is commonly performed in a physicians office, the ASC reimbursement for that procedure is limited to the reimbursement allowable under the Medicare Part B Physician Fee Schedule, with limited exceptions. All surgical procedures, other than those that pose a significant safety risk or generally require an overnight stay, are payable as ASC procedures. From time to time, CMS considers expanding the services that may be performed in ASCs, which may result in more Medicare procedures that historically have been performed in hospitals being moved to ASCs, reducing surgical volume in our hospitals. Also, more Medicare procedures that historically have been performed in ASCs may be moved to physicians offices. Commercial third-party payers may adopt similar policies. For each federal fiscal year, the Health Reform Law provides for an annual reduction to the ASC payment system by a productivity adjustment based on the BLS 10-year moving average of changes in specified economy-wide productivity. For calendar year 2016, CMS increased ASC payments by 0.3%, which included a consumer price index update of 0.8% and a negative 0.5% productivity adjustment. For calendar year 2017, CMS issued a final rule that provides for a 1.9% increase in ASC payments, which reflects a consumer price index update of 2.2% and a negative 0.3% productivity adjustment. In addition, CMS has established a quality reporting program for ASCs under which ASCs that fail to report on specified quality measures will receive a 2% reduction in reimbursement. 
Physician Services 
 Physician services are reimbursed under the physician fee schedule (PFS) system, under which CMS has assigned a national relative value unit (RVU) to most medical procedures and services that reflects the various resources required by a physician to provide the services relative to all other services. While RVUs for various services may change in a given year, any alterations are required by statute to be virtually budget neutral, such that total payments made under the PFS may not differ by more than $20 million from what payments would have been if adjustments were not made. The Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (PAMA) provides for annual reductions in PFS expenditures resulting from adjustments to relative values of misvalued codes. Each RVU is calculated based on a combination of work required in terms of time and intensity of effort for the service, practice expense (overhead) attributable to the service and malpractice insurance expense attributable to the service. These three elements are each modified by a geographic adjustment factor to account for local practice costs and are then aggregated. Under the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA), the PFS reimbursement rate will increase 0.5% each calendar year through 2019. 
 In addition, MACRA required the establishment of the Quality Payment Program (QPP), a payment methodology intended to reward high-quality patient care. Beginning in 2017, physicians and certain other health care clinicians are required to participate in of one of two QPP tracks. Under both tracks, performance data collected in 2017 will affect Medicare payments in 2019. CMS expects to transition increasing financial risk to providers as the QPP evolves. The Advanced Alternative Payment Model (APM) track makes incentive payments available for participation in specific innovative payment models approved by CMS. Providers may earn a 5% Medicare incentive payment between 2019 and 2024 and will be exempt from the reporting requirements and payment adjustments imposed under the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) if the provider has sufficient participation (based on percentage of payments or patients) in an Advanced APM. 
 
9 
 
 Alternatively, providers may participate in the MIPS track. Providers electing this option initially may receive payment incentives or be subject to payment reductions of up to 4% of the providers Medicare payments based on their performance with respect to clinical quality, resource use, clinical improvement activities, and meaningful use of EHRs. The adjustment percentage will increase incrementally, up to 9%, by 2022. MIPS will consolidate components of three existing physician incentive programs: the Physician Quality Reporting System, the Physician Value-Based Payment Modifier, and the Medicare EHR Incentive Program. 
 Other 
 Under PPS, the payment rates are adjusted for the area differences in wage levels by a factor (wage index) reflecting the relative wage level in the geographic area compared to the national average wage level and taking into account occupational mix. The redistributive impact of wage index changes is not anticipated to have a material financial impact for 2017. 
 Medicare reimburses hospitals for a portion (65%) of bad debts resulting from deductible and coinsurance amounts that are uncollectable from Medicare beneficiaries. 
 CMS has implemented contractor reform whereby CMS competitively bids the Medicare fiscal intermediary and Medicare carrier functions to 12 MACs, which are geographically assigned and service both Part A and Part B providers within a given jurisdiction. While chain providers had the option of having all hospitals use one home office MAC, we chose to use the MACs assigned to the geographic areas in which our hospitals are located. CMS periodically re-solicits bids, and the MAC servicing a geographic area can change as a result of the bid competition. MAC transition periods can impact claims processing functions and the resulting cash flow. 
 CMS contracts with third parties to promote the integrity of the Medicare program through reviews of quality concerns and detections and corrections of improper payments. QIOs, for example, are groups of physicians and other health care quality experts that work on behalf of CMS to ensure that Medicare pays only for goods and services that are reasonable and necessary and that are provided in the most appropriate setting. Under the RAC program, CMS contracts with RACs on a contingency basis to conduct post-payment reviews to detect and correct improper payments in the fee-for-service Medicare program. CMS awarded new RAC contracts in 2016, although the original RACs will remain under contract with CMS until 2018 for administrative purposes. The compensation for the RACs is based on their review of claims submitted to Medicare for billing compliance, including correct coding and medical necessity, and the amount of overpayments and underpayments they identify. CMS limits the number of claims that RACs may audit by limiting the number of records that RACs may request from hospitals based on each providers claim denial rate for the previous year. CMS has implemented the RAC program on a permanent, nationwide basis, but has not yet expanded the RAC program as required by the Health Reform Law. 
 We have established policies and procedures to respond to the RAC requests and payment denials. Payment recoveries resulting from RAC reviews and denials are appealable through administrative and judicial processes, and we pursue reversal of adverse determinations at appropriate appeal levels. We incur additional costs related to responding to RAC requests and denials, including costs associated with responding to requests for records and pursuing the reversal of payment denials and losses associated with overpayments that are not reversed upon appeal. Currently, there are significant delays in the assignment of new Medicare appeals to Administrative Law Judges. Depending upon changes to and the growth of RAC programs and our success in appealing claims in future periods, our cash flows and results of operations could be negatively impacted. 
 Managed Medicare 
 Under the Managed Medicare program, the federal government contracts with private health plans to provide members with Medicare Part A, Part B and Part D benefits. Managed Medicare plans can be structured as HMOs, PPOs or private fee-for-service plans. The Medicare program allows beneficiaries to choose 
 
10 
 
 enrollment in certain managed Medicare plans. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 increased reimbursement to managed Medicare plans and expanded Medicare beneficiaries health care options. The Health Reform Law reduced, on a gradual basis through 2017, premium payments to managed Medicare plans such that CMS managed care per capita premium payments generally approximate traditional Medicare costs. In addition, the Health Reform Law requires managed Medicare plans to keep annual administrative costs lower than 15% of annual premium revenue. The Health Reform Law also implements fee payment adjustments based on service benchmarks and quality ratings. The economic environment and changing health reform efforts may result in reduced premium payments from CMS, which may lead to increased beneficiary premiums or limits on benefits which, in turn, may cause decreased enrollment in such plans. 
 Medicaid 
 Medicaid programs are funded jointly by the federal government and the states and are administered by states under approved plans. Most state Medicaid program payments are made under a PPS or are based on negotiated payment levels with individual hospitals. Medicaid reimbursement is often less than a hospitals cost of services. The Health Reform Law, as enacted, requires states to expand Medicaid coverage to all individuals under age 65 with incomes up to 133% of the federal poverty level (FPL) and to apply a 5% income disregard to the eligibility standard, so that eligibility is effectively extended to those with incomes up to 138% of the FPL. However, states may opt out of the expansion without losing existing federal Medicaid funding. A number of states, including Texas and Florida, have opted out of the Medicaid expansion. Some of the states that opted out of the Medicaid expansion provisions are evaluating alternatives such as waiver plans to extend or replace existing supplemental payment programs. However, the future of the Medicaid expansion is uncertain as a result of the 2016 federal elections. 
 Because most states must operate with balanced budgets and because the Medicaid program is often the states largest program, states can be expected to adopt or consider adopting legislation designed to reduce their Medicaid expenditures. Budgetary pressures have, in recent years, resulted and likely will continue to result in decreased spending, or decreased spending growth, for Medicaid programs in many states. Certain states in which we operate have adopted broad-based provider taxes to fund the non-federal share of Medicaid programs. Many states have also adopted, or are considering, legislation designed to reduce coverage, enroll Medicaid recipients in managed care programs and/or impose additional taxes on hospitals to help finance or expand the states Medicaid systems. However, for children, the Health Reform Law, as enacted, requires states to at least maintain Medicaid eligibility standards established prior to the enactment of the law until October 1, 2019. 
 Federal funds under the Medicaid program may not be used to reimburse providers for medical assistance provided to treat certain provider-preventable conditions. Each state Medicaid program must deny payments to providers for the treatment of health care-acquired conditions designated by CMS as well as other provider-preventable conditions that may be designated by the state. 
 Congress has expanded the federal governments involvement in fighting fraud, waste and abuse in the Medicaid program through the Medicaid Integrity Program. CMS employs private contractors, referred to as Medicaid Integrity Contractors (MICs), to perform post-payment audits of Medicaid claims and identify overpayments. In addition to MICs, several other contractors and state Medicaid agencies have increased their review activities. The Health Reform Law increases federal funding for the Medicaid Integrity Program and expands the RAC programs scope to include Medicaid claims by requiring all states to enter into contracts with RACs to audit payments to Medicaid providers. 
 Managed Medicaid 
 Managed Medicaid programs enable states to contract with one or more entities for patient enrollment, care management and claims adjudication. The states usually do not relinquish program responsibilities for financing, eligibility criteria and core benefit plan design. We generally contract directly with one of the designated entities, 
 
11 
 
 usually a managed care organization. The provisions of these programs are state-specific. Many states direct managed care plans to pass through supplemental payments to designated providers, independent of services rendered, to ensure consistent funding of providers that serve large numbers of low-income patients. In 2016, CMS began limiting these pass-through payments to Medicaid managed plans and will ultimately prohibit such payments by 2027. 
 Enrollment in managed Medicaid plans has increased in recent years, as state governments seek to control the cost of Medicaid programs. However, general economic conditions in the states in which we operate may require reductions in premium payments to these plans, which may reduce enrollment in these plans. 
 Accountable Care Organizations and Bundled Payment Initiatives 
 An Accountable Care Organization (ACO) is a network of providers and suppliers that work together to invest in infrastructure and redesign delivery processes to attempt to achieve high quality and efficient delivery of services. Promoting accountability and coordination of care, ACOs are intended to produce savings as a result of improved quality and operational efficiency. ACOs that achieve quality performance standards established by HHS are eligible to share in a portion of the amounts saved by the Medicare program. There are several types of ACO programs, including the Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP), which was established pursuant to the Health Reform Law, and the Next Generation ACO Model. 
 The Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) is responsible for establishing demonstration projects and other initiatives in order to identify, develop, test and encourage the adoption of new methods of delivering and paying for health care that create savings under the Medicare and Medicaid programs while improving quality of care. For example, providers participating in bundled payment initiatives agree to receive one payment for services provided to Medicare patients for certain medical conditions or episodes of care, accepting accountability for costs and quality of care. By rewarding providers for increasing quality and reducing costs and penalizing providers if costs exceed a set amount, these models are intended to lead to higher quality, more coordinated care at a lower cost to the Medicare program. Hospitals may receive supplemental Medicare payments or owe repayments to CMS depending on whether overall CMS spending per episode exceeds or falls below a target specified by CMS and whether quality standards are met. The CMMI has implemented a voluntary bundled payment program known as the Bundled Payment for Care Improvement (BPCI) initiative. More recently, the CMMI implemented a mandatory bundled payment program for hospitals in selected geographic areas that is focused on orthopedic care and established a similar mandatory program focused on cardiac care that is scheduled to begin in 2017. 
 HHS continues to focus on shifting from traditional fee-for-service reimbursement models to alternative payment models that tie reimbursement to quality and/or value, including bundled payment programs. Several private insurance companies have expressed their intent to increasingly rely on such reimbursement models, which may increasingly shift financial risk to providers. 
 Disproportionate Share Hospital Payments 
 In addition to making payments for services provided directly to beneficiaries, Medicare makes additional payments to hospitals that treat a disproportionately large number of low-income patients (Medicaid and Medicare patients eligible to receive Supplemental Security Income). Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) payments are determined annually based on certain statistical information required by HHS and are paid as a percentage addition to MS-DRG payments. 
 The Health Reform Law reduced Medicare DSH payments to 25% of the amount they otherwise would have been absent the law. The remaining 75% of the amount that would otherwise be paid under Medicare DSH is effectively pooled, and this pool is reduced further each year by a formula that reflects reductions in the national level of uninsured who are under 65 years of age. Thus, the greater the level of coverage for the previously uninsured nationally, the more the Medicare DSH payment pool will be reduced. Each DSH hospital is then to be 
 
12 
 
 paid, out of the reduced DSH payment pool, an amount allocated based upon its estimated cost of providing uncompensated care. 
 Hospitals that provide care to a disproportionately high number of low-income patients may receive Medicaid DSH payments. The federal government distributes federal Medicaid DSH funds to each state based on a statutory formula. The states then distribute the DSH funding among qualifying hospitals. States have broad discretion to define which hospitals qualify for Medicaid DSH payments and the amount of such payments. The Health Reform Law and subsequent legislation provide for reductions to the Medicaid DSH hospital program. Under current law, Medicaid DSH will be reduced annually as follows: 2018 ($2 billion); 2019 ($3 billion); 2020 ($4 billion); 2021 ($5 billion); 2022 ($6 billion); 2023 ($7 billion); and 2024 and 2025 ($8 billion each). CMS issued a final rule in 2013 establishing the methodology for allocating the cuts among the states based on the volume of Medicaid inpatients and levels of uncompensated care in each state. Under that rule, states largely retained the ability to manage the reduced allotments and to allocate these cuts among providers within the state. However, due to the delays in the onset of the reductions, a new methodology will be required prior to fiscal year 2018. 
 TRICARE 
 TRICARE is the Department of Defenses health care program for members of the armed forces. For inpatient services, TRICARE reimburses hospitals based on a DRG system modeled on the Medicare inpatient PPS. For outpatient services, TRICARE reimburses hospitals based on a PPS that is similar to that utilized for services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries. 
Annual Cost Reports 
 All hospitals participating in the Medicare, Medicaid and TRICARE programs, whether paid on a reasonable cost basis or under a PPS, are required to meet certain financial reporting requirements. Federal and, where applicable, state regulations require the submission of annual cost reports covering the revenues, costs and expenses associated with the services provided by each hospital to Medicare beneficiaries and Medicaid recipients. 
 Annual cost reports required under the Medicare and Medicaid programs are subject to routine audits, which may result in adjustments to the amounts ultimately determined to be due to us under these reimbursement programs. These audits often require several years to reach the final determination of amounts due to or from us under these programs. Providers also have rights of appeal, and it is common to contest issues raised in audits of cost reports. 
 Managed Care and Other Discounted Plans 
 Most of our hospitals offer discounts from established charges to certain large group purchasers of health care services, including managed care plans and private insurance companies. Admissions reimbursed by commercial managed care and other insurers were 29%, 30% and 30% of our total admissions for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Managed care contracts are typically negotiated for terms between one and three years. While we generally received contracted annual average increases that were expected to yield 4% to 5% from managed care payers during 2016, there can be no assurance that we will continue to receive increases in the future. Further, it is not clear what impact, if any, the increased obligations on managed care payers and other health plans imposed by the Health Reform Law, and any changes to, or the repeal or replacement of, the Health Reform Law, will have on our ability to negotiate reimbursement rates. 
 Uninsured and Self-Pay Patients 
 Self-pay revenues are derived from providing health care services to patients without health insurance coverage and from the patient responsibility portion of payments for our health care services that are not covered 
 
13 
 
 by an individuals health insurance plan. Collection of amounts due from individuals is typically more difficult than collection of amounts due from government or commercial payers. Any increases in uninsured individuals, changes to the payer mix or greater adoption of plan structures that result in higher patient responsibility amounts could increase amounts due from individuals. 
 A high percentage of our uninsured patients are initially admitted through our emergency rooms. For the year ended December 31, 2016, approximately 83% of our admissions of uninsured patients occurred through our emergency rooms. The Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) requires any hospital that participates in the Medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening examination of every person who presents to the hospitals emergency room for treatment and, if the individual is suffering from an emergency medical condition, to either stabilize that condition or make an appropriate transfer of the individual to a facility that can handle the condition. The obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of an individuals ability to pay for treatment. The Health Reform Law currently requires health plans to reimburse hospitals for emergency services provided to enrollees without prior authorization and without regard to whether a participating provider contract is in place. The financial impact of the obligation to screen for and stabilize emergency medical conditions has been offset, in part, by provisions of the Health Reform Law that decrease the number of uninsured individuals, including requirements and incentives for individuals to obtain, and large employers to provide, insurance coverage. 
 Electronic Health Record Incentives 
 The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) provides for Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments for eligible hospitals and for eligible professionals that adopt and meaningfully use certified EHR technology and provides for payment reductions for eligible hospitals and eligible professionals that do not adopt and meaningfully use EHR technology. The incentive payments are available for a maximum period of five or six years, depending on the program. Through December 2016, approximately $36 billion in incentive payments have been made through the Medicare and Medicaid EHR incentive programs to eligible hospitals and eligible professionals. 
Hospital Utilization 
 We believe the most important factors relating to the overall utilization of a hospital are the quality and market position of the hospital and the number and quality of physicians and other health care professionals providing patient care within the facility. Generally, we believe the ability of a hospital to be a market leader is determined by its breadth of services, level of technology, quality and condition of the facilities, emphasis on quality of care and convenience for patients and physicians. Other factors that impact utilization include the growth in local population, local economic conditions and market penetration of managed care programs.

Competition 
 Generally, other hospitals in the communities we serve provide services similar to those offered by our hospitals. Additionally, in recent years the number of freestanding specialty hospitals, surgery centers, emergency departments, urgent care centers and diagnostic and imaging centers in the geographic areas in which we operate has increased significantly. As a result, most of our hospitals operate in a highly competitive environment. In some cases, competing hospitals are more established than our hospitals. Some competing facilities are physician-owned or are owned by tax-supported government agencies and many others are owned by not-for-profit entities that may be supported by endowments, charitable contributions and/or tax revenues and are exempt from sales, property and income taxes. Such exemptions and support are not available to our hospitals and may provide the tax-supported or not-for-profit entities an advantage in funding capital expenditures. In certain localities there are large teaching hospitals that provide highly specialized facilities, equipment and services that may not be available at most of our hospitals. We also face competition from specialty hospitals and from both our own and unaffiliated freestanding ASCs for market share in certain high margin services. 
 Psychiatric hospitals frequently attract patients from areas outside their immediate locale and, therefore, our psychiatric hospitals compete with both local and regional hospitals, including the psychiatric units of general, acute care hospitals. 
 Our strategies are designed to ensure our hospitals are competitive. We believe our hospitals compete within local communities on the basis of many factors, including the quality of care, ability to attract and retain quality physicians, skilled clinical personnel and other health care professionals, location, breadth of services, technology offered, quality and condition of the facilities and prices charged. Hospitals must make public a list of their standard charges for items and services or their policies for providing a list of such charges in response to an inquiry. We have increased our focus on operating outpatient services with improved accessibility and more convenient service for patients and increased predictability and efficiency for physicians. 
 Two of the most significant factors to the competitive position of a hospital are the number and quality of physicians affiliated with or employed by the hospital. Although physicians may at any time terminate their relationship with a hospital we operate, our hospitals seek to retain physicians with varied specialties on the hospitals medical staffs and to attract other qualified physicians. We believe physicians refer patients to a hospital on the basis of the quality and scope of services it renders to patients and physicians, the quality of physicians on the medical staff, the location of the hospital and the quality of the hospitals facilities, equipment and employees. Accordingly, we strive to maintain and provide quality facilities, equipment, employees and services for physicians and patients. Our hospitals face competition from competitors that are implementing physician alignment strategies, such as employing physicians, acquiring physician practice groups and participating in ACOs or other clinical integration models. 
 Another major factor in the competitive position of our hospitals is our ability to negotiate service contracts with purchasers of group health care services. Managed care plans attempt to direct and control the use of hospital services and obtain discounts from hospitals established gross charges. In addition, employers and traditional health insurers continue to attempt to contain costs through negotiations with hospitals for managed care programs and discounts from established gross charges. Generally, hospitals compete for service contracts with group health care services purchasers on the basis of price, market reputation, geographic location, quality and range of services, quality of the medical staff and convenience. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to retain and renew our managed care contracts and enter into new managed care contracts on favorable terms. Other health care providers may impact our ability to enter into managed care contracts or negotiate increases in our reimbursement and other favorable terms and conditions. For example, some of our competitors may negotiate exclusivity provisions with managed care plans or otherwise restrict the ability of managed care companies to contract with us. The trend toward consolidation among non-government payers tends to increase their bargaining power over fee structures. In addition, health reform efforts, such as the Health Reform Laws creation of the Exchanges and limitations on rescissions of coverage and pre-existing condition 
 
16 
 
 exclusions, may lead to non-government payers increasingly demanding reduced fees or being unwilling to negotiate reimbursement increases. Most of the plans offered through the Exchanges provide for narrow networks that restrict the number of participating providers or tiered networks that impose significantly higher cost sharing obligations on patients that obtain services from providers in a disfavored tier. These trends may continue regardless of potential repeal or replacement of, or changes to, the Health Reform Law. The importance of obtaining contracts with managed care organizations varies from community to community, depending on the market strength of such organizations. 
 State certificate of need (CON) laws, which place limitations on a health care facilitys ability to expand services and facilities, make capital expenditures and otherwise make changes in operations, may also have the effect of restricting competition. We currently operate health care facilities in a number of states with CON laws or that require other types of approvals for the establishment or expansion of certain facility types or services. Before issuing a CON or other approval, these states consider the need for additional or expanded health care facilities or services. In those states that do not require state approval or that set relatively high levels of expenditures before they become reviewable by state authorities, competition in the form of new services, facilities and capital spending is more prevalent. See Item 1, Business  Regulation and Other Factors. 
 We and the health care industry as a whole face the challenge of continuing to provide quality patient care while dealing with rising costs and strong competition for patients. Changes in medical technology, existing and future legislation, regulations and interpretations and managed care contracting for provider services by private and government payers remain ongoing challenges. 
 Admissions, average lengths of stay and reimbursement amounts continue to be negatively affected by payer-required pre-admission authorization, utilization review and payer pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative health care delivery services for less acutely ill patients. The Health Reform Law expanded the use of prepayment review by Medicare contractors by eliminating statutory restrictions on their use. Increased competition, admission constraints and payer pressures are expected to continue. To meet these challenges, we intend to expand and update our facilities or acquire or construct new facilities where appropriate, to enhance the provision of a comprehensive array of outpatient services, offer market competitive pricing to private payer groups, upgrade facilities and equipment and offer new or expanded programs and services.

Regulation and Other Factors 
 Licensure, Certification and Accreditation 
 Health care facility construction and operation are subject to numerous federal, state and local regulations relating to the adequacy of medical care, equipment, personnel, operating policies and procedures, maintenance of adequate records, fire prevention, rate-setting and compliance with building codes and environmental protection laws. Facilities are subject to periodic inspection by governmental and other authorities to assure continued compliance with the various standards necessary for licensing and accreditation. We believe our health care facilities are properly licensed under applicable state laws. Each of our acute care hospitals located in the United States is eligible to participate in Medicare and Medicaid programs and is accredited by The Joint Commission. If any facility were to lose its Medicare or Medicaid certification, the facility would be unable to receive reimbursement from federal health care programs. If any facility were to lose accreditation, the facility would be subject to state surveys, potentially be subject to increased scrutiny by CMS and likely lose payment from non-government payers. Management believes our facilities are in substantial compliance with current applicable federal, state, local and independent review body regulations and standards. The requirements for licensure, certification and accreditation are subject to change and, in order to remain qualified, it may become necessary for us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel and services. The requirements for licensure, certification and accreditation also include notification or approval in the event of the transfer or change of ownership or certain other changes. Failure to provide required notifications or obtain necessary approvals in these circumstances can result in the inability to complete an acquisition or change of ownership, loss of licensure, lapses in reimbursement or other penalties. 
Certificates of Need 
 In some states where we operate hospitals and other health care facilities, the construction or expansion of health care facilities, the acquisition of existing facilities, the transfer or change of ownership and the addition of new beds or services may be subject to review by and prior approval of, or notifications to, state regulatory agencies under a CON program. Such laws generally require the reviewing state agency to determine the public need for additional or expanded health care facilities and services. Failure to provide required notifications or obtain necessary state approvals can result in the inability to expand facilities, complete an acquisition or change ownership or other penalties. 
State Rate Review 
 Some states have adopted legislation mandating rate or budget review for hospitals or have adopted taxes on hospital revenues, assessments or licensure fees to fund indigent health care within the state. In the aggregate, indigent tax provisions have not materially, adversely affected our results of operations. Although we do not currently operate facilities in states that mandate rate or budget reviews, we cannot predict whether we will operate in such states in the future, or whether the states in which we currently operate may adopt legislation mandating such reviews. 
Federal Health Care Program Regulations 
 Participation in any federal health care program, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, is heavily regulated by statute and regulation. If a hospital fails to substantially comply with the numerous conditions of participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs or performs certain prohibited acts, the hospitals participation in the federal health care programs may be terminated, or civil and/or criminal penalties may be imposed. As required by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, civil monetary penalties were significantly increased in 2016. Beginning in 2017, the penalties are required to be updated annually based on updates to the consumer price index. 
 
18 
 
Anti-kickback Statute 
 A section of the Social Security Act known as the Anti-kickback Statute prohibits providers and others from directly or indirectly soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration with the intent of generating referrals or orders for services or items covered by a federal health care program. Courts have interpreted this statute broadly and held that there is a violation of the Anti-kickback Statute if just one purpose of the remuneration is to generate referrals, even if there are other lawful purposes. Furthermore, the Health Reform Law provides that knowledge of the law or the intent to violate the law is not required. Violations of the Anti-kickback Statute may be punished by a criminal fine of up to $25,000 for each violation or imprisonment, civil money penalties of up to $74,792 per violation, after taking into account 2017 updates, and damages of up to three times the total amount of the remuneration and/or exclusion from participation in federal health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. These civil monetary penalties will be updated annually based on changes to the consumer price index. In addition, submission of a claim for services or items generated in violation of the Anti-kickback Statute may be subject to additional penalties under the federal False Claims Act (FCA) as a false or fraudulent claim. 
 The OIG, among other regulatory agencies, is responsible for identifying and eliminating fraud, abuse and waste. The OIG carries out this mission through a nationwide program of audits, investigations and inspections. The OIG provides guidance to the industry through various methods including advisory opinions and Special Fraud Alerts. These Special Fraud Alerts do not have the force of law, but identify features of arrangements or transactions that the government believes may cause the arrangements or transactions to violate the Anti-kickback Statute or other federal health care laws. The OIG has identified several incentive arrangements that constitute suspect practices, including: (a) payment of any incentive by a hospital each time a physician refers a patient to the hospital, (b) the use of free or significantly discounted office space or equipment in facilities usually located close to the hospital, (c) provision of free or significantly discounted billing, nursing or other staff services, (d) free training for a physicians office staff in areas such as management techniques and laboratory techniques, (e) guarantees which provide, if the physicians income fails to reach a predetermined level, the hospital will pay any portion of the remainder, (f) low-interest or interest-free loans, or loans which may be forgiven if a physician refers patients to the hospital, (g) payment of the costs of a physicians travel and expenses for conferences, (h) coverage on the hospitals group health insurance plans at an inappropriately low cost to the physician, (i) payment for services (which may include consultations at the hospital) which require few, if any, substantive duties by the physician, (j) purchasing goods or services from physicians at prices in excess of their fair market value, (k) rental of space in physician offices, at other than fair market value terms, by persons or entities to which physicians refer, and (l) physician-owned entities (frequently referred to as physician-owned distributorships or PODs) that derive revenue from selling, or arranging for the sale of, implantable medical devices ordered by their physician-owners for use on procedures that physician-owners perform on their own patients at hospitals or ASCs. The OIG has encouraged persons having information about hospitals who offer the above types of incentives to physicians to report such information to the OIG. 
 The OIG also issues Special Advisory Bulletins as a means of providing guidance to health care providers. These bulletins, along with the Special Fraud Alerts, have focused on certain arrangements that could be subject to heightened scrutiny by government enforcement authorities, including: (a) contractual joint venture arrangements and other joint venture arrangements between those in a position to refer business, such as physicians, and those providing items or services for which Medicare or Medicaid pays, and (b) certain gainsharing arrangements, i.e., the practice of giving physicians a share of any reduction in a hospitals costs for patient care attributable in part to the physicians efforts. 
 In addition to issuing Special Fraud Alerts and Special Advisory Bulletins, the OIG issues compliance program guidance for certain types of health care providers. The OIG guidance identifies a number of risk areas under federal fraud and abuse statutes and regulations. These areas of risk include compensation arrangements with physicians, recruitment arrangements with physicians and joint venture relationships with physicians. 
 
19 
 
As authorized by Congress, the OIG has published safe harbor regulations that outline categories of activities deemed protected from prosecution under the Anti-kickback Statute. Currently, there are statutory exceptions and safe harbors for various activities, including the following: certain investment interests, space rental, equipment rental, practitioner recruitment, personnel services and management contracts, sale of practice, referral services, warranties, discounts, employees, group purchasing organizations, waiver of beneficiary coinsurance and deductible amounts, managed care arrangements, obstetrical malpractice insurance subsidies, investments in group practices, freestanding surgery centers, ambulance replenishing, and referral agreements for specialty services. 
 The fact that conduct or a business arrangement does not fall within a safe harbor or is identified in a Special Fraud Alert, Special Advisory Bulletin or other guidance does not necessarily render the conduct or business arrangement illegal under the Anti-kickback Statute. However, such conduct and business arrangements may lead to increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities. 
 We have a variety of financial relationships with physicians and others who either refer or influence the referral of patients to our hospitals, other health care facilities and employed physicians, including employment contracts, leases, medical director agreements and professional service agreements. We also have similar relationships with physicians and facilities to which patients are referred from our facilities and other providers. In addition, we provide financial incentives, including minimum revenue guarantees, to recruit physicians into the communities served by our hospitals. While we endeavor to comply with the applicable safe harbors, certain of our current arrangements, including joint ventures and financial relationships with physicians and other referral sources and persons and entities to which we refer patients, do not qualify for safe harbor protection. 
 Although we believe our arrangements with physicians and other referral sources and referral recipients have been structured to comply with current law and available interpretations, there can be no assurance regulatory authorities enforcing these laws will determine these financial arrangements comply with the Anti-kickback Statute or other applicable laws. An adverse determination could subject us to liabilities under the Social Security Act and other laws, including criminal penalties, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid or other federal health care programs. 
 Stark Law 
 The Social Security Act also includes a provision commonly known as the Stark Law. The Stark Law prohibits physicians from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to entities with which they or any of their immediate family members have a financial relationship, if these entities provide certain designated health services reimbursable by Medicare or Medicaid unless an exception applies. The Stark Law also prohibits entities that provide designated health services reimbursable by Medicare and Medicaid from billing the Medicare and Medicaid programs for any items or services that result from a prohibited referral and requires the entities to refund amounts received for items or services provided pursuant to the prohibited referral on a timely basis. Designated health services include inpatient and outpatient hospital services, clinical laboratory services and radiology services. Sanctions for violating the Stark Law include denial of payment, civil monetary penalties of up to $24,253 per claim submitted and exclusion from the federal health care programs. Failure to refund amounts received as a result of a prohibited referral on a timely basis may constitute a false or fraudulent claim and may result in civil penalties and additional penalties under the FCA. The statute also provides for a penalty of up to $161,692 for a circumvention scheme. These penalties take into account 2017 updates will be further updated annually based on changes to the consumer price index. 
 There are exceptions to the self-referral prohibition for many of the customary financial arrangements between physicians and providers, including employment contracts, leases and recruitment agreements. Unlike safe harbors under the Anti-kickback Statute with which compliance is voluntary, a financial relationship must comply with every requirement of a Stark Law exception or the arrangement is in violation of the Stark Law. Although there is an exception for a physicians ownership interest in an entire hospital, the Health Reform Law 
 
20 
 
 prohibits physician-owned hospitals established after December 31, 2010 from billing for Medicare or Medicaid patients referred by their physician owners. As a result, the law effectively prevents the formation of new physician-owned hospitals that participate in Medicare or Medicaid. While the Health Reform Law grandfathers existing physician-owned hospitals, it does not allow these hospitals to increase the percentage of physician ownership and significantly restricts their ability to expand services. 
 Through a series of rulemakings, CMS has issued final regulations implementing the Stark Law. While these regulations were intended to clarify the requirements of the exceptions to the Stark Law, it is unclear how the government will interpret many of these exceptions for enforcement purposes. Further, we do not always have the benefit of significant regulatory or judicial interpretation of the Stark Law and its implementing regulations. We attempt to structure our relationships to meet an exception to the Stark Law, but the regulations implementing the exceptions are detailed and complex, and we cannot assure that every relationship complies fully with the Stark Law. 
 Similar State Laws 
 Many states in which we operate also have laws similar to the Anti-kickback Statute that prohibit payments to physicians for patient referrals and laws similar to the Stark Law that prohibit certain self-referrals. These state laws often apply regardless of the source of payment for care, and little precedent exists for their interpretation or enforcement. These statutes typically provide for criminal and civil penalties, as well as loss of licensure. 
Other Fraud and Abuse Provisions 
 The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) broadened the scope of certain fraud and abuse laws by adding several criminal provisions for health care fraud offenses that apply to all health benefit programs. The Social Security Act also imposes criminal and civil penalties for making false claims and statements to Medicare and Medicaid. False claims include, but are not limited to, billing for services not rendered or for misrepresenting actual services rendered in order to obtain higher reimbursement, billing for unnecessary goods and services and cost report fraud. Federal enforcement officials have the ability to exclude from Medicare and Medicaid any business entities and any investors, officers and managing employees associated with business entities that have committed health care fraud, even if the officer or managing employee had no knowledge of the fraud. Criminal and civil penalties may be imposed for a number of other prohibited activities, including failure to return known overpayments, certain gainsharing arrangements, billing Medicare amounts that are substantially in excess of a providers usual charges, offering remuneration to influence a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiarys selection of a health care provider, contracting with an individual or entity known to be excluded from a federal health care program, making or accepting a payment to induce a physician to reduce or limit services, and soliciting or receiving any remuneration in return for referring an individual for an item or service payable by a federal health care program. Like the Anti-kickback Statute, these provisions are very broad. Civil penalties may be imposed for the failure to report and return an overpayment within 60 days of identifying the overpayment or by the date a corresponding cost report is due, whichever is later. To avoid liability, providers must, among other things, carefully and accurately code claims for reimbursement, promptly return overpayments and accurately prepare cost reports. 
 Some of these provisions, including the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Law, require a lower burden of proof than other fraud and abuse laws, including the Anti-kickback Statute. Civil monetary penalties of up to $74,792 per act, after taking into account 2017 updates, may be imposed under the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Law. These penalties will be updated annually based on changes to the consumer price index. In some cases, violations of the Civil Monetary Penalty Law may result in penalties of up to three times the remuneration offered, paid, solicited or received. In addition, a violator may be subject to exclusion from federal and state health care programs. Federal and state governments increasingly use the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Law, especially where they believe they cannot meet the higher burden of proof requirements under the Anti-kickback Statute. Further, individuals can receive up to $1,000 for providing information on Medicare fraud and abuse that leads to the recovery of at least $100 of Medicare funds under the Medicare Integrity Program.

The Federal False Claims Act and Similar State Laws 
 We are subject to state and federal laws that govern the submission of claims for reimbursement and prohibit the making of false claims or statements. One of the most prominent of these laws is the FCA, which may be enforced by the federal government directly or by a qui tam plaintiff, or whistleblower, on the governments behalf. The government may use the FCA to prosecute Medicare and other government program fraud in areas such as coding errors, billing for services not provided and submitting false cost reports. In addition, the FCA covers payments made in connection with the Exchanges created under the Health Reform Law, if those payments include any federal funds. When a private party brings a qui tam action under the FCA, the defendant is not made aware of the lawsuit until the government commences its own investigation or makes a determination whether it will intervene. If a defendant is determined by a court of law to be liable under the FCA, the defendant may be required to pay three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $10,957 and $21,916 for each separate false claim. These penalties take into account 2017 updates will be further updated annually based on changes to the consumer price index. 
 There are many potential bases for liability under the FCA. Liability often arises when an entity knowingly submits a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government. The FCA defines the term knowingly broadly. Though simple negligence will not give rise to liability under the FCA, submitting a claim with reckless disregard to its truth or falsity constitutes a knowing submission under the FCA and, therefore, may create liability. Submission of claims for services or items generated in violation of the Anti-kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim under the FCA. Whistleblowers and the federal government have taken the position, and some courts have held, that providers who allegedly have violated other statutes, such as the Stark Law, have thereby submitted false claims under the FCA. False claims under the FCA also include the knowing and improper failure to report and refund amounts owed to the government in a timely manner following identification of an overpayment. An overpayment is deemed to be identified when a person has, or should have through reasonable diligence, determined that an overpayment was received and quantified the overpayment. 
 Every entity that receives at least $5 million annually in Medicaid payments must have written policies for all employees, contractors or agents, providing detailed information about false claims, false statements and whistleblower protections under certain federal laws, including the FCA, and similar state laws. In addition, federal law provides an incentive to states to enact false claims laws comparable to the FCA. A number of states in which we operate have adopted their own false claims provisions as well as their own whistleblower provisions under which a private party may file a civil lawsuit in state court. We have adopted and distributed policies pertaining to the FCA and relevant state laws. 
 HIPAA Administrative Simplification and Privacy and Security Requirements 
 The Administrative Simplification Provisions of HIPAA and implementing regulations require the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for certain health care claims and payment transactions submitted or received electronically. These provisions are intended to encourage electronic commerce in the health care industry. As required by the Health Reform Law, HHS is in the process of adopting standards for additional electronic transactions and establishing operating rules to promote uniformity in the implementation of each standardized electronic transaction. In addition, HIPAA requires that each provider use a National Provider Identifier. CMS published a final rule requiring the use of updated standard code sets for certain diagnoses and procedures known as ICD-10 code sets. Health plans and providers, including our hospitals, were required to transition to the ICD-10 code sets by October 1, 2015, which required significant administrative changes. 
 The privacy and security regulations promulgated pursuant to HIPAA extensively regulate the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information, known as protected health information, and require covered entities, including health plans and most health care providers, to implement administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the security of such information. Certain provisions of the security and privacy regulations apply to business associates (entities that handle protected health information on behalf of covered 
 
22 
 
 entities), and business associates are subject to direct liability for violation of these provisions. In addition, a covered entity may be subject to penalties as a result of a business associate violating HIPAA, if the business associate is found to be an agent of the covered entity. 
 Covered entities must report breaches of unsecured protected health information to affected individuals without unreasonable delay but not to exceed 60 days of discovery of the breach by a covered entity or its agents. Notification must also be made to HHS and, in certain situations involving large breaches, to the media. HHS is required to publish on its website a list of all covered entities that report a breach involving more than 500 individuals. All non-permitted uses or disclosures of unsecured protected health information are presumed to be breaches unless the covered entity or business associate establishes that there is a low probability the information has been compromised. Various state laws and regulations may also require us to notify affected individuals in the event of a data breach involving individually identifiable information. 
 Violations of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations may result in criminal penalties and in civil penalties of up to $55,910 per violation for a maximum of $1,677,299 in a calendar year for violations of the same requirement, after taking into account 2017 updates. These civil penalties will be updated annually based on updates to the consumer price index. HHS enforces the regulations and performs compliance audits. In addition to enforcement by HHS, state attorneys general are authorized to bring civil actions seeking either injunction or damages in response to violations that threaten the privacy of state residents. HHS may resolve HIPAA violations through informal means, such as allowing a covered entity to implement a corrective action plan, but HHS has the discretion to move directly to impose monetary penalties and is required to impose penalties for violations resulting from willful neglect. We enforce a HIPAA compliance plan, which we believe complies with the HIPAA privacy and security regulations and under which a HIPAA compliance group monitors our compliance. The HIPAA privacy regulations and security regulations have and will continue to impose significant costs on our facilities in order to comply with these standards. 
 There are numerous other laws and legislative and regulatory initiatives at the federal and state levels addressing privacy and security concerns. Our facilities remain subject to any federal or state privacy-related laws that are more restrictive than the privacy regulations issued under HIPAA. These laws vary and could impose additional penalties. For example, the Federal Trade Commission uses its consumer protection authority to initiate enforcement actions in response to data breaches. 
 EMTALA 
 All of our hospitals in the United States are subject to EMTALA. This federal law requires any hospital participating in the Medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening examination of every individual who presents to the hospitals emergency room for treatment and, if the individual is suffering from an emergency medical condition, to either stabilize the condition or make an appropriate transfer of the individual to a facility able to handle the condition. The obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of an individuals ability to pay for treatment. There are severe penalties under EMTALA if a hospital fails to screen or appropriately stabilize or transfer an individual or if the hospital delays appropriate treatment in order to first inquire about the individuals ability to pay. Penalties for violations of EMTALA include exclusion from participation in the Medicare program and civil monetary penalties. These civil monetary penalties increased significantly in 2016, were further adjusted in 2017 and will be increased annually based on updates to the consumer price index. In addition, an injured individual, the individuals family or a medical facility that suffers a financial loss as a direct result of a hospitals violation of the law can bring a civil suit against the hospital. 
 The government broadly interprets EMTALA to cover situations in which individuals do not actually present to a hospitals emergency room, but present for emergency examination or treatment to the hospitals campus, generally, or to a hospital-based clinic that treats emergency medical conditions or are transported in a hospital-owned ambulance, subject to certain exceptions. At least one court has interpreted the law also to apply to a hospital that has been notified of a patients pending arrival in a non-hospital owned ambulance. EMTALA 
 
23 
 
 does not generally apply to individuals admitted for inpatient services. The government has expressed its intent to investigate and enforce EMTALA violations actively. We believe our hospitals operate in substantial compliance with EMTALA. 
 Corporate Practice of Medicine/Fee Splitting 
 Some of the states in which we operate have laws prohibiting corporations and other entities from employing physicians, practicing medicine for a profit and making certain direct and indirect payments to, or entering into fee-splitting arrangements with, health care providers designed to induce or encourage the referral of patients to, or the recommendation of, particular providers for medical products and services. Possible sanctions for violation of these restrictions include loss of license and civil and criminal penalties. In addition, agreements between the corporation and the physician may be considered void and unenforceable. These statutes vary from state to state, are often vague and have seldom been interpreted by the courts or regulatory agencies. 
 Health Care Industry Investigations 
 Significant media and public attention has focused in recent years on the hospital industry. This media and public attention, changes in government personnel and other factors have led to increased scrutiny of the health care industry. Except as may be disclosed in our SEC filings, we are not aware of any material investigations of the Company under federal or state health care laws or regulations. It is possible that governmental entities could initiate investigations or litigation in the future at facilities we operate and that such matters could result in significant penalties, as well as adverse publicity. It is also possible that our executives and managers could be included in governmental investigations or litigation or named as defendants in private litigation. 
 Our substantial Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental billings result in heightened scrutiny of our operations. We continue to monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards. Because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving, governmental investigations or litigation may result in interpretations that are inconsistent with our or industry practices. 
 In public statements surrounding current investigations, governmental authorities have taken positions on a number of issues, including some for which little official interpretation previously has been available, that appear to be inconsistent with practices that have been common within the industry and that previously have not been challenged in this manner. In some instances, government investigations that have in the past been conducted under the civil provisions of federal law may now be conducted as criminal investigations. 
 Both federal and state government agencies have increased their focus on and coordination of civil and criminal enforcement efforts in the health care area. The OIG and the Department of Justice (DOJ) have, from time to time, established national enforcement initiatives, targeting all hospital providers that focus on specific billing practices or other suspected areas of abuse. The Health Reform Law includes additional federal funding of $350 million over 10 years to fight health care fraud, waste and abuse, including $10 million in federal fiscal year 2017. In addition, governmental agencies and their agents, such as MACs, fiscal intermediaries and carriers, may conduct audits of our health care operations. Private payers may conduct similar post-payment audits, and we also perform internal audits and monitoring. 
 In addition to national enforcement initiatives, federal and state investigations have addressed a wide variety of routine health care operations such as: cost reporting and billing practices, including for Medicare outliers; financial arrangements with referral sources; physician recruitment activities; physician joint ventures; and hospital charges and collection practices for self-pay patients. We engage in many of these routine health care operations and other activities that could be the subject of governmental investigations or inquiries. For example, we have significant Medicare and Medicaid billings, numerous financial arrangements with physicians who are referral sources to our hospitals, and joint venture arrangements involving physician investors. Certain of our individual facilities have received, and other facilities may receive, government inquiries from, and may be subject to investigation by, federal and state agencies. Any additional investigations of the Company, our executives or managers could result in significant liabilities or penalties to us, as well as adverse publicity.

Health Care Reform 
 The health care industry is subject to changing political, regulatory, and other influences, along with various scientific and technological initiatives. In recent years, the U.S. Congress and certain state legislatures have passed a large number of laws and regulations intended to effect major change within the U.S. health care system. The 2016 federal elections may result in the repeal of, significant changes to, or the replacement of the Health Reform Law, the most prominent of these reform efforts. Currently, the Health Reform Law affects how health care services are covered, delivered and reimbursed through expanded health insurance coverage, reduced growth in Medicare program spending, reductions in Medicare and Medicaid DSH payments, and the establishment of programs that tie reimbursement to quality and integration. 
 The Health Reform Law expands coverage through a combination of public program expansion and private sector health insurance and other reforms. Expansion in public program coverage has been driven primarily by expanding the categories of individuals eligible for Medicaid coverage and permitting individuals with relatively higher incomes to qualify. A number of states, including Texas and Florida, have opted out of the Medicaid expansion provisions, which they may do without losing federal funding. For states that have not participated in the Medicaid expansion, the maximum income level required for individuals and families to qualify for Medicaid varies widely from state to state. Some of the states that have opted out of the Medicaid expansion are evaluating or participating in alternatives such as waiver plans. 
 The expansion of health coverage through the private sector as a result of the Health Reform Law has been driven by new requirements applicable to health insurers, employers and individuals. For example, health insurers are prohibited from imposing annual coverage limits, dropping coverage, excluding persons based upon pre-existing conditions or denying coverage for any individual who is willing to pay the premiums for such coverage. Large employers are required to provide health insurance benefits to their full time employees or pay a penalty if an employee obtains government-subsidized coverage through an Exchange. Individuals are required to maintain health insurance for a minimum defined set of benefits or pay a tax penalty. The cost of obtaining health insurance through the Exchanges is subsidized by the federal government for individuals and families below 400% of the FPL. 
 To facilitate the purchase of health insurance by individuals and small employers, the Health Reform Law mandates that each state establish or participate in an Exchange or default to a federally-operated Exchange. Health insurers participating in an Exchange must offer a set of minimum benefits, as defined by HHS, and may offer more benefits. However, several insurers have limited or ended their participation in these marketplaces, creating uncertainty regarding the long-term viability of the Exchanges. 
 As discussed in Item 1, Business  Sources of Revenue, the Health Reform Law provides for spending reductions for Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health care programs. It also increasingly ties payment for services to quality outcomes, provides for the creation of ACOs, and creates incentives and other initiatives to better coordinate patient care across settings and over time. 
 The Health Reform Law also makes several significant changes to health care fraud and abuse laws, provides additional enforcement tools to the government, increases cooperation between agencies by establishing mechanisms for the sharing of information and enhances criminal and administrative penalties for non-compliance. For example, the Health Reform Law tightens up the rules for returning overpayments made by governmental health programs and expands FCA liability to include failure to timely repay identified overpayments. The Health Reform Law also prohibits newly created physician-owned hospitals from billing for Medicare patients referred by their physician owners. As a result, the law effectively prevents the formation of new physician-owned hospitals that participate in Medicare and Medicaid after December 31, 2010. While the law grandfathers existing physician-owned hospitals, it does not allow these hospitals to increase the percentage of physician ownership and significantly restricts their ability to expand services. 
 
25 
 
The Health Reform Law has had a net positive effect on the Company to date, before considering the impact of Medicare reductions that began in 2010, and it is expected that the law, as presently implemented, will continue to have a meaningful contribution to the Companys results of operations. However, the Company could be affected by efforts to change, repeal or replace the Health Reform Law and the potential instability of the Exchanges, as discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors. 
 General Economic and Demographic Factors 
 The health care industry is impacted by the overall United States economy. Budget deficits at federal, state and local government entities have had a negative impact on spending for many health and human service programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and similar programs, which represent significant payer sources for our hospitals. We anticipate that the federal deficit, the growing magnitude of Medicare expenditures and the aging of the United States population will continue to place pressure on federal health care programs. Other risks we face during periods of economic weakness and high unemployment include potential declines in the population covered under managed care agreements, increased patient decisions to postpone or cancel elective and nonemergency health care procedures, increases in the uninsured and underinsured populations, increased adoption of health plan structures that shift financial responsibility to patients and further difficulties in our collecting patient receivables for copayment and deductible amounts. 
Compliance Program 
 We maintain a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards. The program is intended to monitor and raise awareness of various regulatory issues among employees and to emphasize the importance of complying with governmental laws and regulations. As part of the ethics and compliance program, we provide annual ethics and compliance training to our employees and encourage all employees to report any violations to their supervisor, an ethics and compliance officer or a toll-free telephone ethics line. The Health Reform Law requires providers to implement core elements of compliance program criteria to be established by HHS, on a timeline to be established by HHS, as a condition of enrollment in the Medicare or Medicaid programs, and we may have to modify our compliance programs to comply with these new criteria. 
Antitrust Laws 
 The federal government and most states have enacted antitrust laws that prohibit certain types of conduct deemed to be anti-competitive. These laws prohibit price fixing, market allocation, bid-rigging, concerted refusal to deal, market monopolization, price discrimination, tying arrangements, acquisitions of competitors and other practices that have, or may have, an adverse effect on competition. Violations of federal or state antitrust laws can result in various sanctions, including criminal and civil penalties. Antitrust enforcement in the health care industry is currently a priority of the Federal Trade Commission and the DOJ. We believe we are in compliance with such federal and state laws, but courts or regulatory authorities may reach a determination in the future that could adversely affect our operations. 
Environmental Matters 
 We are subject to various federal, state and local statutes and ordinances regulating the discharge of materials into the environment. We do not believe that we will be required to expend any material amounts in order to comply with these laws and regulations. 
Insurance 
 As is typical in the health care industry, we are subject to claims and legal actions by patients in the ordinary course of business. Subject, in most cases, to a $15 million per occurrence self-insured retention, our facilities are insured by our 100% owned insurance subsidiary for losses up to $50 million per occurrence. The insurance 
 
26 
 
 subsidiary has obtained reinsurance for professional liability risks generally above a retention level of $25 million per occurrence. We also maintain professional liability insurance with unrelated commercial carriers for losses in excess of amounts insured by our insurance subsidiary. 
 We purchase, from unrelated insurance companies, coverage for cyber security incidents, directors and officers liability and property loss in amounts we believe are adequate. The cyber security and directors and officers liability coverage each include a $5 million corporate deductible. In addition, we will continue to purchase coverage for our directors and officers on an ongoing basis. The property coverage includes varying deductibles depending on the cause of the property damage. These deductibles range from $100,000 per claim up to 5% of the affected property values for certain flood and wind and earthquake related incidents. 
 Employees and Medical Staffs 
 At December 31, 2016, we had approximately 241,000 employees, including approximately 61,000 part-time employees. References herein to employees refer to employees of our affiliates. We are subject to various state and federal laws that regulate wages, hours, benefits and other terms and conditions relating to employment. At December 31, 2016, certain employees at 37 of our domestic hospitals are represented by various labor unions. While no elections are expected in 2017, it is possible additional hospitals may unionize in the future. We consider our employee relations to be good and have not experienced work stoppages that have materially, adversely affected our business or results of operations. Our hospitals, like most hospitals, have experienced rising labor costs. In some markets, nurse and medical support personnel availability has become a significant operating issue to health care providers. To address this challenge, we have implemented several initiatives to improve retention, recruiting, compensation programs and productivity. 
 Our hospitals are staffed by licensed physicians, including both employed physicians and physicians who are not employees of our hospitals. Some physicians provide services in our hospitals under contracts, which generally describe a term of service, provide and establish the duties and obligations of such physicians, require the maintenance of certain performance criteria and fix compensation for such services. Any licensed physician may apply to be accepted to the medical staff of any of our hospitals, but the hospitals medical staff and the appropriate governing board of the hospital, in accordance with established credentialing criteria, must approve acceptance to the staff. Members of the medical staffs of our hospitals often also serve on the medical staffs of other hospitals and may terminate their affiliation with one of our hospitals at any time. 
 We may be required to continue to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other medical support personnel or to hire more expensive temporary or contract personnel. As a result, our labor costs could increase. We also depend on the available labor pool of semi-skilled and unskilled employees in each of the markets in which we operate. Recent changes by the National Labor Relations Board (the NLRB) in its election procedures could increase the likelihood of employee unionization attempts. To the extent a significant portion of our employee base unionizes, our costs could increase materially. In addition, the states in which we operate could adopt mandatory nurse-staffing ratios or could reduce mandatory nurse-staffing ratios already in place. State-mandated nurse-staffing ratios could significantly affect labor costs, and have an adverse impact on revenues if we are required to limit patient admissions in order to meet the required ratios.

 Item 1A.    Risk Factors
If any of the events discussed in the following risk factors were to occur, our business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows or prospects could be materially, adversely affected. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known, or currently deemed immaterial, may also constrain our business and operations. 
 Our substantial leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations. 
 We are highly leveraged. As of December 31, 2016, our total indebtedness was $31.376 billion. As of December 31, 2016, we had availability of $1.767 billion under our senior secured revolving credit facility and $330 million under our asset-based revolving credit facility, after giving effect to letters of credit and borrowing base limitations. Our high degree of leverage could have important consequences, including: 
 

 | increasing our vulnerability to downturns or adverse changes in general economic, industry or competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | requiring a substantial portion of cash flows from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flows to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our unhedged borrowings are at variable rates of interest;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | limiting our ability to make strategic acquisitions or causing us to make nonstrategic divestitures;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, share repurchases, product or service line development, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
31 
 

 | limiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We and our subsidiaries have the ability to incur additional indebtedness in the future, subject to the restrictions contained in our senior secured credit facilities and the indentures governing our outstanding notes. If new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify. 
 We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may not be able to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms. If we are unable to do so, we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful. 
 Our ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We cannot assure you we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. 
 In addition, we conduct our operations through our subsidiaries. Accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness is dependent on the generation of cash flows by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness. Each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity, and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. 
 We may find it necessary or prudent to refinance our outstanding indebtedness, the terms of which may not be favorable to us. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms, or at all, is directly affected by the then current global economic and financial conditions. In addition, our ability to incur secured indebtedness (which would generally enable us to achieve better pricing than the incurrence of unsecured indebtedness) depends in part on the value of our assets, which depends, in turn, on the strength of our cash flows and results of operations, and on economic and market conditions and other factors. 
 If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations or we are unable to refinance our indebtedness, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. If our operating results and available cash are insufficient to meet our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions, or the proceeds from the dispositions may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. 
 Our debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business. 
 Our senior secured credit facilities and, to a lesser extent, the indentures governing our outstanding notes contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants limit our and certain of our subsidiaries ability to, among other things: 
 

 | incur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


 | pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of our capital stock or make other restricted payments;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | make certain investments;
--+--------------------------


 | sell or transfer assets;
--+-------------------------

 
32 
 

 | create liens;
--+--------------


 | consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | enter into certain transactions with our affiliates.
--+-----------------------------------------------------

 Under our asset-based revolving credit facility, when (and for as long as) the combined availability under our asset-based revolving credit facility and our senior secured revolving credit facility is less than a specified amount for a certain period of time or, if a payment or bankruptcy event of default has occurred and is continuing, funds deposited into any of our depository accounts will be transferred on a daily basis into a blocked account with the administrative agent and applied to prepay loans under the asset-based revolving credit facility and to collateralize letters of credit issued thereunder. 
 Under our senior secured credit facilities, we are required to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios. Our ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control, and there can be no assurance we will continue to meet those ratios. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under both the cash flow credit facility and the asset-based revolving credit facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under these senior secured credit facilities, the lenders thereunder could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the senior secured credit facilities to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit, which would also result in an event of default under a significant portion of our outstanding indebtedness. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure such indebtedness. We have pledged a significant portion of our assets under our senior secured credit facilities and that collateral is also pledged as collateral under our first lien notes. If any of the lenders under the senior secured credit facilities accelerate the repayment of borrowings, there can be no assurance there will be sufficient assets to repay the senior secured credit facilities, the first lien notes and our other indebtedness. 
 Our hospitals face competition for patients from other hospitals and health care providers. 
 The health care business is highly competitive, and competition among hospitals and other health care providers for patients has intensified in recent years. Generally, other hospitals in the communities we serve provide services similar to those offered by our hospitals. In addition, CMS publicizes on its Hospital Compare website performance data related to quality measures and data on patient satisfaction surveys hospitals submit in connection with their Medicare reimbursement. Federal law provides for the future expansion of the number of quality measures that must be reported. Additional quality measures and future trends toward clinical transparency may have an unanticipated impact on our competitive position and patient volumes. Further, every hospital must establish and update annually a public listing of the hospitals standard charges for items and services. If any of our hospitals achieve poor results (or results that are lower than our competitors) on these quality measures or on patient satisfaction surveys or if our standard charges are higher than our competitors, our patient volumes could decline. 
 In addition, the number of freestanding specialty hospitals, surgery centers, emergency departments, urgent care centers and diagnostic and imaging centers in the geographic areas in which we operate has increased significantly. As a result, most of our hospitals operate in a highly competitive environment. Some of the facilities that compete with our hospitals are physician-owned or are owned by governmental agencies or not-for-profit corporations supported by endowments, charitable contributions and/or tax revenues and can finance capital expenditures and operations on a tax-exempt basis. Our hospitals face competition from competitors that are implementing physician alignment strategies, such as employing physicians, acquiring physician practice groups and participating in ACOs or other clinical integration models. Our hospitals compete with specialty hospitals and with both our own and unaffiliated freestanding surgery centers for market share in certain high margin services and for quality physicians and personnel. If ASCs are better able to compete in this environment than our hospitals, our hospitals may experience a decline in patient volume, and we may experience a decrease in margin, even if those patients use our ASCs. In states that do not require a CON or other 
 
33 
 
 type of approval for the purchase, construction or expansion of health care facilities or services, competition in the form of new services, facilities and capital spending is more prevalent. Further, if our competitors are better able to attract patients, make capital expenditures and maintain modern and technologically upgraded facilities and equipment, recruit physicians, expand services or obtain favorable managed care contracts at their facilities than our hospitals and ASCs, we may experience an overall decline in patient volume. See Item 1, Business  Competition. 
 A deterioration in the collectability of uninsured and patient due accounts could adversely affect our results of operations. 
 The primary collection risks for our accounts receivable relate to the uninsured patient accounts and patient accounts for which the primary insurance carrier has paid the amounts covered by the applicable agreement, but patient responsibility amounts (exclusions, deductibles and copayments) remain outstanding. The provision for doubtful accounts relates primarily to amounts due directly from patients. Medicare reimburses hospitals for 65% of eligible Medicare bad debts. To be eligible for reimbursement, the amounts claimed must meet certain criteria, including that the debt is related to unpaid deductible or coinsurance amounts and that the hospital first attempted to collect the fees from the Medicare beneficiary. 
 The amount of the provision for doubtful accounts is based upon managements assessment of historical write-offs and expected net collections, business and economic conditions, trends in federal and state governmental and private employer health care coverage, the rate of growth in uninsured patient admissions and other collection indicators. At December 31, 2016, our allowance for doubtful accounts represented approximately 97.5% of the $5.116 billion patient due accounts receivable balance. The sum of the provision for doubtful accounts, uninsured discounts and charity care increased from $15.943 billion for 2014 to $18.287 billion for 2015 and to $20.455 billion for 2016. 
 Any increase in the amount or deterioration in the collectability of uninsured accounts receivable will adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations. Our facilities may experience growth in bad debts, uninsured discounts and charity care as a result of a number of factors, including conditions impacting the overall economy and high unemployment. As a result of the 2016 federal elections, the provisions of the Health Reform Law that have reduced the number of uninsured individuals may be repealed or significantly changed. Even if the Health Reform Law remains in effect, we will continue to experience collectability issues and provide uninsured discounts and charity care for individuals residing in states that choose not to implement the Medicaid expansion, for undocumented aliens who are not permitted to enroll in an Exchange or government health care programs and for certain others who may not have insurance coverage. Further, some patients may choose to enroll in lower cost Medicaid plans or other insurance plans with lower reimbursement levels. We may also be adversely affected by the growth in patient responsibility accounts as a result of increases in the adoption of plan structures that shift greater responsibility for care to individuals through greater exclusions and copayment and deductible amounts. 
 Changes in government health care programs may adversely affect our revenues. 
 A significant portion of our patient volume is derived from government health care programs, principally Medicare and Medicaid. Specifically, we derived 41.7% of our revenues from the Medicare and Medicaid programs in 2016. Changes in government health care programs may reduce the reimbursement we receive and could adversely affect our business and results of operations. The Health Reform Law has made significant changes to Medicare and Medicaid, and future health reform efforts or efforts to repeal or significantly change the Health Reform Law may impact these programs. 
 In recent years, legislative and regulatory changes have resulted in limitations on and, in some cases, reductions in levels of payments to health care providers for certain services under the Medicare program. The BCA requires automatic spending reductions of $1.2 trillion for federal fiscal years 2013 through 2021, minus 
 
34 
 
 any deficit reductions enacted by Congress and debt service costs. However, the percentage reduction for Medicare may not be more than 2% for a fiscal year, with a uniform percentage reduction across all Medicare programs. These reductions have been extended by Congress through 2025. We are unable to predict what other deficit reduction initiatives may be proposed by Congress or whether Congress will attempt to suspend or restructure the automatic budget cuts. These reductions are in addition to reductions mandated by the Health Reform Law, which provides for material reductions in the growth of Medicare program spending, including reductions in Medicare market basket updates and Medicare DSH funding. Further, from time to time, CMS revises the reimbursement systems used to reimburse health care providers, including changes to the MS-DRG system and other payment systems, which may result in reduced Medicare payments. For example, CMS has established what is referred to as the two midnight rule. Under the rule, services provided to Medicare beneficiaries are only payable as inpatient hospital services when there is a reasonable expectation that the hospital care is medically necessary and will be required across two midnights, absent unusual circumstances. Stays expected to need fewer than two midnights of hospital care will be subject to medical review by QIOs on a case-by-case basis. Providers that exhibit persistent noncompliance with the two midnight rule may be referred to RACs. 
 Because most states must operate with balanced budgets and because the Medicaid program is often a states largest program, some states have enacted or may consider enacting legislation designed to reduce their Medicaid expenditures. Further, many states have also adopted, or are considering, legislation designed to reduce coverage, enroll Medicaid recipients in managed care programs and/or impose additional taxes on hospitals to help finance or expand the states Medicaid systems. Periods of economic weakness may increase the budgetary pressures on many states, and these budgetary pressures may result in decreased spending, or decreased spending growth, for Medicaid programs and CHIP in many states. Some states that provide Medicaid supplemental payments are reviewing these programs or have filed waiver requests with CMS to replace these programs, and CMS has performed and continues to perform compliance reviews of some states programs, which could result in Medicaid supplemental payments being reduced or eliminated. Currently, Texas operates a Medicaid Waiver Program pursuant to a waiver that CMS agreed to extend through December 31, 2017. Texas has requested an additional extension of the waiver through September 30, 2019. We cannot predict whether the Texas Medicaid Waiver Program will be further extended, continue in its current form or guarantee that revenues recognized from the program will not decrease. Further, legislation and administrative actions at the federal level may significantly alter the funding for, or structure of, the Medicaid program. For example, from time to time, Congress considers proposals to restructure the Medicaid program to involve block grants that would be administered by the states. 
 In some cases, commercial third-party payers rely on all or portions of Medicare payment systems to determine payment rates. Changes to government health care programs that reduce payments under these programs may negatively impact payments from commercial third-party payers. 
 Current or future health care reform and deficit reduction efforts, changes in laws or regulations regarding government health care programs, other changes in the administration of government health care programs and changes by commercial third-party payers in response to health care reform and other changes to government health care programs could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. 
 Our results of operations may be adversely affected if the Health Reform Law is repealed, replaced or otherwise significantly changed. We are unable to predict what, if any, and when such changes will be made in the future. 
 The Health Reform Law has reduced the number of uninsured patients to whom we provide health care services. It has done so primarily through the Exchanges and Medicaid expansion. It also, however, reduced our Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, including reductions to market basket increases that took effect before the effective date of the market reforms and Medicaid expansion. Some of those decreases were substantial. Nevertheless, it is expected that the Health Reform Law, as presently implemented, will continue to have a meaningful contribution to the Companys results of operations. 
 
35 
 
However, many insurers have exited the Exchanges in the markets served by the Company. To the extent some markets lack a sufficient number of insurers participating in the Exchanges, it could threaten the continued viability of the Exchanges in those markets. 
 In addition, it has been publicly reported that there are proposals being discussed in Congress and the administration to repeal, amend or replace the law. Some of those proposals include age-based rather than income-based tax credits, as well as risk pools for those with pre-existing conditions. Further, there are proposals to create block grants to states for Medicaid or to establish per capita caps on state Medicaid programs. Those block grants or per capita caps could apply not only to the Medicaid expansion under the Health Reform Law, but also to Medicaid as a whole. We cannot predict whether any such repeal, amend or replace proposals, or any parts of them, will become law, and if they do what their substance or timing will be. The President of the United States has also signed an executive order that directs agencies to minimize economic and regulatory burdens of the Health Reform Law. It is unclear what regulations or policies will be proposed and implemented pursuant to that executive order. 
 If any of the foregoing events were to occur, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 
 If our volume of patients with commercial insurance declines or we are unable to retain and negotiate favorable contracts with nongovernment payers, including managed care plans, our revenues may be reduced. 
 Nongovernment payers, including HMOs, PPOs and other managed care plans, typically reimburse health care providers at a higher rate than Medicare, Medicaid or other government health care programs. Reimbursement rates are set forth by contract when our facilities are in-network, and payers utilize plan structures to encourage or require the use of in-network providers. Revenues derived from nongovernment payers (domestic only) accounted for 56.5%, 55.2% and 54.4% of our revenues for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As a result, our ability to maintain or increase patient volumes covered by nongovernment payers and to maintain and obtain favorable contracts with nongovernment payers significantly affects the revenues and operating results of our facilities. 
 Nongovernment payers, including managed care payers, continue to demand discounted fee structures, and the trend toward consolidation among nongovernment payers tends to increase their bargaining power over fee structures. Nongovernment payers may utilize plan structures such as narrow networks and tiered networks that limit beneficiary provider choices or impose significantly higher cost sharing obligations when care is obtained from providers in a disfavored tier. Other health care providers may impact our ability to enter into managed care contracts or negotiate increases in our reimbursement and other favorable terms and conditions. For example, some of our competitors may negotiate exclusivity provisions with managed care plans or otherwise restrict the ability of managed care companies to contract with us. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to 
 
36 
 
 retain and renew our managed care contracts and enter into new managed care contracts on terms favorable to us. It is not clear what impact, if any, future health reform efforts or the repeal of, or changes to, the Health Reform Law will have on our ability to negotiate reimbursement increases and participate in plan networks on favorable terms. If we are unable to retain and negotiate favorable contracts with managed care plans or experience reductions in payment increases or amounts received from nongovernment payers, our revenues may be reduced. 
 Our performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain quality physicians. 
 The success of our hospitals depends in part on the number and quality of the physicians on the medical staffs of our hospitals, the admitting and utilization practices of those physicians, maintaining good relations with those physicians and controlling costs related to the employment of physicians. Although we employ some physicians, physicians are often not employees of the hospitals at which they practice, and, in many of the markets we serve, most physicians have admitting privileges at other hospitals in addition to our hospitals. Such physicians may terminate their affiliation with our hospitals at any time. We may face increased challenges in this area as the physician population reaches retirement age, especially if there is a shortage of physicians willing and able to provide comparable services. If we are unable to provide adequate support personnel or technologically advanced equipment and hospital facilities that meet the needs of those physicians and their patients, they may be discouraged from referring patients to our facilities, admissions may decrease and our operating performance may decline. 
 Our hospitals face competition for staffing, which may increase labor costs and reduce profitability. 
 Our operations are dependent on the efforts, abilities and experience of our management and medical support personnel, such as nurses, pharmacists and lab technicians, as well as our physicians. We compete with other health care providers in recruiting and retaining qualified management and support personnel responsible for the daily operations of each of our hospitals, including nurses and other nonphysician health care professionals. In some markets, the availability of nurses and other medical support personnel has been a significant operating issue to health care providers. We may be required to continue to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other medical support personnel or to hire more expensive temporary or contract personnel. As a result, our labor costs could increase. We also depend on the available labor pool of semi-skilled and unskilled employees in each of the markets in which we operate. Certain proposed changes in federal labor laws and the NLRBs modification of its election procedures could increase the likelihood of employee unionization attempts. To the extent a significant portion of our employee base unionizes, it is possible our labor costs could increase materially. When negotiating collective bargaining agreements with unions, whether such agreements are renewals or first contracts, there is the possibility that strikes could occur during the negotiation process, and our continued operation during any strikes could increase our labor costs. In addition, the states in which we operate could adopt mandatory nurse-staffing ratios or could reduce mandatory nurse staffing ratios already in place. State-mandated nurse-staffing ratios could significantly affect labor costs and have an adverse impact on revenues if we are required to limit admissions in order to meet the required ratios. If our labor costs increase, we may not be able to raise rates to offset these increased costs. Because a significant percentage of our revenues consists of fixed, prospective payments, our ability to pass along increased labor costs is constrained. Our failure to recruit and retain qualified management, nurses and other medical support personnel, or to control labor costs, could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 If we fail to comply with extensive laws and government regulations, we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations. 
 The health care industry is required to comply with extensive and complex laws and regulations at the federal, state and local government levels relating to, among other things: 
 

 | billing and coding for services and properly handling overpayments;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


 | appropriateness and classification of level of care provided, including proper classification of inpatient admissions, observation services and outpatient care;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
37 
 

 | relationships with physicians and other referral sources and referral recipients;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | necessity and adequacy of medical care;
--+----------------------------------------


 | quality of medical equipment and services;
--+-------------------------------------------


 | qualifications of medical and support personnel;
--+-------------------------------------------------


 | confidentiality, maintenance, data breach, identity theft and security issues associated with health-related and personal information and medical records;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | screening, stabilization and transfer of individuals who have emergency medical conditions;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | licensure, certification and enrollment with government programs;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


 | hospital rate or budget review;
--+--------------------------------


 | debt collection;
--+-----------------


 | preparing and filing of cost reports;
--+--------------------------------------


 | operating policies and procedures;
--+-----------------------------------


 | activities regarding competitors;
--+----------------------------------


 | addition of facilities and services; and
--+-----------------------------------------


 | environmental protection.
--+--------------------------

 Among these laws are the federal Anti-kickback Statute, the federal Stark Law, the FCA and similar state laws. We have a variety of financial relationships with physicians and others who either refer or influence the referral of patients to our hospitals, other health care facilities and employed physicians or who are the recipients of referrals, and these laws govern those relationships. The OIG has enacted safe harbor regulations that outline practices deemed protected from prosecution under the Anti-kickback Statute. While we endeavor to comply with the applicable safe harbors, certain of our current arrangements, including joint ventures and financial relationships with physicians and other referral sources and persons and entities to which we refer patients, do not qualify for safe harbor protection. Failure to qualify for a safe harbor does not mean the arrangement necessarily violates the Anti-kickback Statute but may subject the arrangement to greater scrutiny. However, we cannot offer assurance that practices outside of a safe harbor will not be found to violate the Anti-kickback Statute. Allegations of violations of the Anti-kickback Statute may be brought under the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Law, which requires a lower burden of proof than other fraud and abuse laws, including the Anti-kickback Statute. 
 Our financial relationships with referring physicians and their immediate family members must comply with the Stark Law by meeting an exception. We attempt to structure our relationships to meet an exception to the Stark Law, but the regulations implementing the exceptions are detailed and complex, and we cannot provide assurance that every relationship complies fully with the Stark Law. Unlike the Anti-kickback Statute, failure to meet an exception under the Stark Law results in a violation of the Stark Law, even if such violation is technical in nature. 
 Additionally, if we violate the Anti-kickback Statute or Stark Law, or if we improperly bill for our services, we may be found to violate the FCA, either under a suit brought by the government or by a private person under a qui tam, or whistleblower, suit. See Item 1, Business  Regulation and Other Factors. 
 We also operate health care facilities in the United Kingdom and have operations and commercial relationships with companies in other foreign jurisdictions and, as a result, are subject to certain U.S. and foreign laws applicable to businesses generally, including anti-corruption laws. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act regulates U.S. companies in their dealings with foreign officials, prohibiting bribes and similar practices, and requires that they maintain records that fairly and accurately reflect transactions and appropriate internal accounting controls. In addition, the United Kingdom Bribery Act has wide jurisdiction over certain activities that affect the United Kingdom.

We engage in consumer debt collection for HCA affiliated hospitals and certain non-affiliated hospitals. The federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and Telephone Consumer Protection Act restrict the methods that companies may use to contact and seek payment from consumer debtors regarding past due accounts. Many states impose additional requirements on debt collection practices, and some of those requirements may be more stringent than the federal requirements. 
 If we fail to comply with these or other applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to liabilities, including civil penalties, the loss of our licenses to operate one or more facilities, exclusion of one or more facilities from participation in the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state health care programs and criminal penalties. 
 We do not always have the benefit of significant regulatory or judicial interpretation of these laws and regulations. In the future, different interpretations or enforcement of, or amendment to, these or other laws and regulations could subject our current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel, services, capital expenditure programs and operating expenses. A determination that we have violated these or other laws, or the public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of these or other laws, could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects, and our business reputation could suffer significantly. In addition, other legislation or regulations at the federal or state level may be adopted that adversely affect our business. 
 We have been and could become the subject of governmental investigations, claims and litigation. 
 Health care companies are subject to numerous investigations by various governmental agencies. Further, under the FCA, private parties have the right to bring qui tam, or whistleblower, suits against companies that submit false claims for payments to, or improperly retain overpayments from, the government. Some states have adopted similar state whistleblower and false claims provisions. Certain of our individual facilities have received, and other facilities may receive, government inquiries from, and may be subject to investigation by, federal and state agencies. Depending on whether the underlying conduct in these or future inquiries or investigations could be considered systemic, their resolution could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity. 
 Governmental agencies and their agents, such as the MACs, fiscal intermediaries and carriers, as well as the OIG, CMS and state Medicaid programs, conduct audits of our health care operations. Private payers may conduct similar post-payment audits, and we also perform internal audits and monitoring. Depending on the nature of the conduct found in such audits and whether the underlying conduct could be considered systemic, the resolution of these audits could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity. 
 CMS contracts with RACs on a contingency fee basis to conduct post-payment reviews to detect and correct improper payments in the fee-for-service Medicare program. The Health Reform Law expanded the RAC programs scope to include managed Medicare plans and Medicaid claims. RAC denials are appealable; however, there are currently significant delays in the assignment of new Medicare appeals to Administrative Law Judges, which negatively impacts our ability to appeal RAC payment denials. In addition, CMS employs MICs to perform post-payment audits of Medicaid claims and identify overpayments, and state Medicaid agencies and other contractors have increased their review activities. 
 Should we be found out of compliance with any of these laws, regulations or programs, depending on the nature of the findings, our business, our financial position and our results of operations could be negatively impacted.

Changes to physician utilization practices and treatment methodologies, governmental or managed care controls designed to reduce inpatient services or surgical procedures and other factors outside our control that impact demand for medical services may reduce our revenues. 
 Controls imposed by Medicare, managed Medicare, Medicaid, managed Medicaid and commercial third-party payers designed to reduce admissions, intensity of services, surgical volumes and lengths of stay, in some instances referred to as utilization review, have affected and are expected to continue to affect our facilities. Utilization review entails the review of the admission and course of treatment of a patient by health plans. The Medicare program also issues national or local coverage determinations that restrict the circumstances under which Medicare pays for certain services. Inpatient utilization, average lengths of stay and occupancy rates continue to be negatively affected by payer-required preadmission authorization, coverage restrictions and utilization review and by payer pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative health care delivery services for less acutely ill patients. Efforts to impose more stringent cost controls are expected to continue. Additionally, trends in physician treatment protocols and managed care health plan design, such as plans that shift increased costs and accountability for care to patients, could reduce our surgical volumes and admissions in favor of lower intensity and lower cost treatment methodologies. 
 Volume, admission and case-mix trends may be impacted by other factors beyond our control, such as changes in volume of certain high acuity services, variations in the prevalence and severity of outbreaks of influenza and other illnesses and medical conditions, seasonal and severe weather conditions, changes in treatment regimens and medical technology and other advances. These factors may reduce the demand for services we offer and decrease the reimbursement that we receive. Significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed, cost controls, changes to physician utilization practices, treatment methodologies, reimbursement rates and fees and other factors beyond our control could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. 
 Our overall business results may suffer during periods of general economic weakness. 
 Budget deficits at federal, state and local government entities have had a negative impact on spending, and may continue to negatively impact spending, for health and human service programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and similar programs, which represent significant payer sources for our hospitals. Other risks we face during periods of economic weakness and high unemployment include potential declines in the population covered under managed care agreements, patient decisions to postpone or cancel elective and nonemergency health care procedures (including delaying surgical procedures), potential increases in the uninsured and underinsured populations and further difficulties in collecting patient copayment and deductible receivables. 
 The industry trend toward value-based purchasing may negatively impact our revenues. 
 There is a trend in the health care industry toward value-based purchasing of health care services. These value-based purchasing programs include both public reporting of quality data and preventable adverse events tied to the quality and efficiency of care provided by facilities. Governmental programs including Medicare currently require hospitals to report certain quality data to receive full reimbursement updates. In addition, Medicare does not reimburse for care related to certain preventable adverse events (also called never events). The Health Reform Law also prohibits the use of federal funds under the Medicaid program to reimburse providers for medical assistance provided to treat HACs. As of federal fiscal year 2015, the 25% of hospitals with the worst risk-adjusted HAC rates in the designated performance period receive a 1% reduction in their inpatient PPS Medicare payments. 
 Hospitals with excess readmission rates for conditions designated by HHS will receive a reduction in their inpatient PPS operating Medicare payments for all Medicare inpatient discharges, not just discharges relating to the conditions subject to the excess readmission standard. The reduction in payments to hospitals with excess readmissions can be up to 3% for federal fiscal year 2015 and subsequent years. 
 
40 
 
HHS has implemented a value-based purchasing program for inpatient hospital services that reduces inpatient hospital payments for all discharges by 2% in federal fiscal year 2017 and for subsequent years. HHS pools the amount collected from these reductions to fund payments to reward hospitals that meet or exceed certain quality performance standards established by HHS. HHS estimates that $1.8 billion in value-based incentive payments will be available to hospitals in federal fiscal year 2017 based on achievement (relative to other hospitals) and improvement (relative to the hospitals own past performance). Hospitals that meet or exceed the quality performance standards will receive greater reimbursement under the value-based purchasing program than they would have otherwise. 
 In 2016, CMS implemented a five-year mandatory bundled payment initiative for orthopedic services in selected markets. It also established a new mandatory bundled payment initiative that is focused on cardiac care and is scheduled to begin in 2017. Depending on whether overall CMS spending per episode exceeds or falls below a target specified by CMS and whether quality standards are met, hospitals may receive supplemental Medicare payments or owe repayments to CMS. Mandatory participation in demonstration projects, particularly demonstrations with the potential to affect payment, may negatively impact our results of operations. 
 Many large commercial payers currently require hospitals to report quality data, and several commercial payers do not reimburse hospitals for certain preventable adverse events. Further, we have implemented a policy pursuant to which we do not bill patients or third-party payers for fees or expenses incurred due to certain preventable adverse events. 
 We expect value-based purchasing programs, including programs that condition reimbursement on patient outcome measures, to become more common and to involve a higher percentage of reimbursement amounts. CMS has announced aggressive goals for adopting alternative payment models, which may include additional mandatory bundled or other alternative payment programs, and commercial insurers may also transition away from fee-for-service payment models. We are unable at this time to predict our future payments or whether we will be subject to payment reductions under these programs or how this trend will affect our results of operations, but it could negatively impact our revenues. 
 Our operations could be impaired by a failure of our information systems. 
 The performance of our information systems is critical to our business operations. In addition to our shared services initiatives, our information systems are essential to a number of critical areas of our operations, including: 
 

 | accounting and financial reporting;
--+------------------------------------


 | billing and collecting accounts;
--+---------------------------------


 | coding and compliance;
--+-----------------------


 | clinical systems;
--+------------------


 | medical records and document storage;
--+--------------------------------------


 | inventory management;
--+----------------------


 | negotiating, pricing and administering managed care contracts and supply contracts; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | monitoring quality of care and collecting data on quality measures necessary for full Medicare payment updates.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Information systems may be vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including telecommunications or network failures, human acts and natural disasters. We have taken precautionary measures to prevent unanticipated problems that could affect our information systems. Nevertheless, we may experience system failures. The occurrence of any system failure could result in interruptions, delays, the loss or corruption of data and cessations or interruptions in the availability of systems, all of which could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations and harm our business reputation.

A cybersecurity incident could result in the compromise of a facility, confidential data or critical data systems and give rise to potential harm to patients, remediation and other expenses, expose us to liability under HIPAA, consumer protection laws, or other common law theories, subject us to litigation and federal and state governmental inquiries, damage our reputation, and otherwise be disruptive to our business. 
 We collect and store on our networks sensitive information, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our patients and employees. In addition, we have made significant investments in technology to adopt and utilize EHR and to become meaningful users of health information technology. The secure maintenance of this information and technology is critical to our business operations. We have implemented multiple layers of security measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of this data and the systems and devices that store and transmit such data. We utilize current security technologies, and our defenses are monitored and routinely tested internally and by external parties. Despite these efforts, threats from malicious persons and groups, new vulnerabilities and advanced new attacks against information systems create risk of cybersecurity incidents. There can be no assurance that we will not be subject to cybersecurity incidents that bypass our security measures, impact the integrity, availability or privacy of personal health information or other data subject to privacy laws or disrupt our information systems, devices or business, including our ability to provide various health care services. As a result, cybersecurity, physical security and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our facilities, information systems and data from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for us. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any cybersecurity vulnerabilities. The occurrence of any of these events could result in (i) harm to patients; (ii) business interruptions and delays; (iii) the loss, misappropriation, corruption or unauthorized access of data; (iv) litigation and potential liability under privacy, security and consumer protection laws or other applicable laws; (v) reputational damage and (vi) federal and state governmental inquiries, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations and harm our business reputation. 
 If we fail to continue to demonstrate meaningful use of certified electronic health record systems, our operations could be adversely affected. 
 As of 2015, eligible hospitals and eligible professionals that fail to demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology in an applicable prior reporting period are subject to reduced payments from Medicare. Failure to continue to demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology could have a material, adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. 
 The emergence and effects related to a pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease could adversely affect our operations. 
 If a pandemic, epidemic, outbreak of an infectious disease or other public health crisis were to occur in an area in which we operate, our operations could be adversely affected. Such a crisis could diminish the public trust in health care facilities, especially hospitals that fail to accurately or timely diagnose, or are treating (or have treated) patients affected by infectious diseases. If any of our facilities were involved, or perceived as being involved, in treating patients from such an infectious disease, patients might cancel elective procedures or fail to seek needed care at our facilities. Further, a pandemic, epidemic or outbreak might adversely affect our operations by causing a temporary shutdown or diversion of patients, by disrupting or delaying production and delivery of materials and products in the supply chain or by causing staffing shortages in our facilities. We have disaster plans in place and operate pursuant to infectious disease protocols, but the potential emergence of a pandemic, epidemic or outbreak is difficult to predict and could adversely affect our operations.

State efforts to regulate the construction or expansion of health care facilities could impair our ability to operate and expand our operations. 
 Some states, particularly in the eastern part of the country, require health care providers to obtain prior approval, often known as a CON, for the purchase, construction or expansion of health care facilities, to make certain capital expenditures or to make changes in services or bed capacity. In giving approval, these states consider the need for additional or expanded health care facilities or services. We currently operate health care facilities in a number of states with CON laws or that require other types of approvals for the establishment or expansion of certain facility types or services. The failure to obtain any required CON or other required approval could impair our ability to operate or expand operations. Any such failure could, in turn, adversely affect our ability to attract patients and physicians to our facilities and grow our revenues, which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations. 
 We may encounter difficulty acquiring hospitals and other health care businesses, encounter challenges integrating the operations of acquired hospitals and other health care businesses and become liable for unknown or contingent liabilities as a result of acquisitions. 
 A component of our business strategy is acquiring hospitals and other health care businesses. We may encounter difficulty acquiring new facilities or other businesses as a result of competition from other purchasers that may be willing to pay purchase prices that are higher than we believe are reasonable. Some states require CONs in order to acquire a hospital or other facility or to expand facilities or services. In addition, the acquisition of health care facilities often involves licensure approvals or reviews and complex change of ownership processes for Medicare and other payers. Further, many states have laws that restrict the conversion or sale of not-for-profit hospitals to for-profit entities. These laws may require prior approval from the state attorney general, advance notification of the attorney general or other regulators and community involvement. Attorneys general in states without specific requirements may exercise broad discretionary authority over transactions involving the sale of not-for-profits under their general obligations to protect the use of charitable assets. These conversion legislative and administrative efforts often focus on the appropriate valuation of the assets divested and the use of the proceeds of the sale by the non-profit seller and may include consideration of commitments for capital improvements and charity care by the purchaser. Also, the increasingly challenging regulatory and enforcement environment may negatively impact our ability to acquire health care businesses if they are found to have material unresolved compliance issues, such as repayment obligations. Resolving compliance issues as well as completion of oversight, review or approval processes could seriously delay or even prevent our ability to acquire hospitals or other businesses and increase our acquisition costs. 
 We may be unable to timely and effectively integrate hospitals and other businesses that we acquire with our ongoing operations, or we may experience delays implementing operating procedures and systems. Hospitals and other health care businesses that we acquire may have unknown or contingent liabilities, including liabilities for failure to comply with health care and other laws and regulations, medical and general professional liabilities, workers compensation liabilities and tax liabilities. Although we typically exclude significant liabilities from our acquisition transactions and seek indemnification from the sellers for these matters, we could experience difficulty enforcing those obligations, experience liability in excess of any indemnification obtained or otherwise incur material liabilities for the pre-acquisition conduct of acquired businesses. Such liabilities and related legal or other costs could harm our business and results of operations. 
 Our facilities are heavily concentrated in Florida and Texas, which makes us sensitive to regulatory, economic, environmental and competitive conditions and changes in those states. 
 We operated 170 hospitals at December 31, 2016, and 83 of those hospitals are located in Florida and Texas. Our Florida and Texas facilities combined revenues represented approximately 47% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016. This concentration makes us particularly sensitive to regulatory, economic, environmental and competitive conditions and changes in those states. Any material change in the 
 
43 
 
 current payment programs or regulatory, economic, environmental or competitive conditions in those states could have a disproportionate effect on our overall business results. 
 In addition, our hospitals in Florida, Texas and other areas across the Gulf Coast are located in hurricane-prone areas. In the past, hurricanes have had a disruptive effect on the operations of our hospitals in Florida, Texas and other coastal states and the patient populations in those states. Our business activities could be harmed by a particularly active hurricane season or even a single storm, and the property insurance we obtain may not be adequate to cover losses from future hurricanes or other natural disasters. 
 We may be subject to liabilities from claims by taxing authorities. 
 We are subject to examination by federal, state and foreign taxing authorities. Management believes HCA Holdings, Inc., its predecessors, subsidiaries and affiliates properly reported taxable income and paid taxes in accordance with applicable laws and agreements established with the IRS, state and foreign taxing authorities and final resolution of any disputes will not have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. However, if payments due upon final resolution of any issues exceed our recorded estimates, such resolutions could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. 
 We may be subject to liabilities from claims brought against our facilities. 
 We are subject to litigation relating to our business practices, including claims and legal actions by patients and others in the ordinary course of business alleging malpractice, product liability or other legal theories. Many of these actions seek large sums of money as damages and involve significant defense costs. We insure a portion of our professional liability risks through a 100% owned subsidiary. Management believes our reserves for self-insured retentions and insurance coverage are sufficient to cover insured claims arising out of the operation of our facilities. Our 100% owned liability insurance subsidiary has entered into certain reinsurance contracts; however, the subsidiary remains liable to the extent that the reinsurers do not meet their obligations under the reinsurance contracts. If payments for claims exceed actuarially determined estimates, are not covered by insurance, or reinsurers, if any, fail to meet their obligations, our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected. 
 We are exposed to market risk related to changes in the market values of securities and interest rate changes. 
 We are exposed to market risk related to changes in market values of securities. The investments in debt and equity securities of our 100% owned insurance subsidiaries were $381 million and $4 million, respectively, at December 31, 2016. These investments are carried at fair value, with changes in unrealized gains and losses being recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive income. At December 31, 2016, we had a net unrealized gain of $11 million on the insurance subsidiaries investment securities. 
 We are exposed to market risk related to market illiquidity. Investments in debt and equity securities of our 100% owned insurance subsidiaries could be impaired by the inability to access the capital markets. Should the 100% owned insurance subsidiaries require significant amounts of cash in excess of normal cash requirements to pay claims and other expenses on short notice, we may have difficulty selling these investments in a timely manner or be forced to sell them at a price less than what we might otherwise have been able to in a normal market environment. We may be required to recognize other-than-temporary impairments on long-term investments in future periods should issuers default on interest payments or should the fair market valuations of the securities deteriorate due to ratings downgrades or other issue specific factors. 
 We are also exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates, and we periodically enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to these fluctuations. Our interest rate swap agreements involve the exchange of fixed and variable rate interest payments between two parties, based on common notional principal amounts and maturity dates. The notional amounts of the swap agreements represent balances used to calculate the exchange of cash flows and are not our assets or liabilities.

Certain of our investors may continue to have influence over us. 
 On November 17, 2006, HCA Inc. was acquired by a private investor group, including affiliates of HCA founder, Dr. Thomas F. Frist, Jr. and by members of management and certain other investors. Through their investment in Hercules Holding II, certain of these investors continue to hold a significant interest in our outstanding common stock (approximately 18.6% as of January 31, 2017). In addition, pursuant to a shareholders agreement we entered into with Hercules Holding II, certain representatives of these investors have the continued right to nominate certain of the members of our Board of Directors. As a result, certain of these investors potentially have the ability to influence our decisions to enter into corporate transactions (and the terms thereof) and prevent changes in the composition of our Board of Directors and any transaction that requires stockholder approval.
