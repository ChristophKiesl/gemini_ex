Payment Market - Asian Market
 
Asia stands at the forefront of payment innovation, particularly in regards to digital and online payments, accounting for 51% of the global market share. Asia’s market share of the global payment market grew 6% in 2020, and is projected to achieve a Compound Annual Growth Rate (“CAGR”) of 6% from 2019 to 2024, slightly above the global GDP rate of 5%, with the majority of growth evidenced in countries in Southeast Asia.[1]
 
On the other hand, Southeast Asian countries continue to be defined by extraordinary rates of growth in digital payment markets, implying a CAGR of 21.3% in Malaysia, 20.2% in Vietnam, 18.6% in the Philippines and Indonesia. Digital adoption in Southeast Asian countries currently grows at a CAGR of 14%, and is expected to reach 292 million smartphone users by the end of 2020.[2]
 
Southeast Asian countries like Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Myanmar have started to implement new payment methods like Faster payments, Bulk payments and online payments using electronic wallets since 2018. The adoption of these new payment methods has increased significantly, especially with the onset of the COVID 19 pandemic.
 
It is expected that the global digital payment market will increase at a CAGR of 6%, with total revenues increasing by $715 billion and surpassing $2.7 trillion by 2023. In emerging counties, electronic payments transactions are increasing at a rate of 22% over the next five years to support revenue growth. It is projected that the global payment market will remain fairly high at 14% CAGR for the next five years.[3]
 
Regtech – Asian Market
 
RegTech is the management of regulatory processes within the financial industry via technology, including regulatory monitoring, reporting and compliance. In recent years, there has been a strong regulatory focus on financial crime. The key drivers of RegTech adoption consist of compliance, cost, and complexity. The ability of RegTech using technologies such as advanced analytics, robotic process automation and cognitive computing offer new efficiencies in compliance, which offers a lower cost.[4]
 
The RegTech market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 23.5%, from USD 4.3 billion to USD 12.3 billion by 2023. Asia-Pacific is expected to become the new engine of Regtech growth and innovation, contributing 20% of the global market share, lagging only the American market. While most RegTech firms are based in the United States and Europe, local players are starting to appear in Asia especially in Malaysia.[5]
 
Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) adopted RegTech at an early stage in 2017 along with the release of the “Financial Services Industry Transformation Map” to make Singapore the leading global financial centre in Asia. In September 2020, MAS was awarded the “Global Impact” award at the Central Banking FinTech RegTech awards.[6] On the other hand, Hong Kong plans to launch a series of RegTech specific projects focusing on AML, prudential risk management and compliance, study on machine-readable regulations and exploration of RegTech.
 
In Malaysia, Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) has initiated a standard reporting platform based on XBRL in 2012, which requires all Reporting Entities (RE) to adopt RegTech in their data reporting systems. This includes all statistics reporting, credit risk and international transactions exposure assets and liabilities. Similar initiatives have been adopted by the Securities Commission for all publicly listed companies.
 
The RegTech industry is now moving into the third stage from ‘know your customer’ to ‘know your data’, as financial institutions start to view risks and regulations as data and prediction problems that can be addressed by technology. Despite the popularity of adopting RegTech, it is not a solution for all corporate governance and risk management issues. Data quality is a major key factor to ensure the accuracy and efficiency of RegTech.
 
Hence, Companies may require data quality improvement beforehand in a more well-mannered way and may adopt a hybrid of humanity and RegTech in order to make compliance decisions, as opposed to a full dependence on technology.[7] Therefore, with accurate data quality, the potential of RegTech can be maximized and can be used in different industries to improve efficiency and effectiveness.

Robotic Process Automation
 
Robotic Process Automation (RPA) also called “intelligent automation” or “smart automation” refers to advanced technologies that can be programmed to perform a series of tasks, like data manipulation, triggering responses, and creating necessary communication with other processes and systems. RPA is similar to traditional IT automation but the major difference between these technologies is that RPA is, itself, capable of learning and is adaptive to changing circumstances, while a traditional IT automation system is not.[8] In Asia-Pacific, the RPA market size is estimated to be USD $29 Billion, implying 203% growth by 2021.[9]
 
The factor that is driving the growth of this market is the high level of cost savings for businesses. Since robots are utilized for the processes it helps reduce operational costs and also the costs arising from human error. Thus, a onetime investment on RPA ensures high returns to businesses who are more than eager to integrate these processes in their workflows. The adoption of RPA among SMEs, especially financial services, are causing market growth to thrive. The increasing shift toward cloud-based solutions and the increasing adoption of robot-based solutions in different industries are expected to create new opportunities for the establishment of the robotic process automation market globally. Asia-Pacific is expected to emerge as the fastest growing market during the forecasted period. The development of Asian countries and the demand for consumer electronic products is forcing manufacturers to adopt cost-effective technology in the manufacturing process. With rapid advancements in digitization and information technology, the Asia Pacific region is expected to grow at the highest CAGR in robotic process automation market.
 
The cost of Labour in the Southeast Asia region has required the significant use of RPA to augment the need to hire more staff to perform mundane and repetitive tasks. The use of RPA has been the buzz word in all business sectors starting in Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines and Indonesia.
 
Unattended Payment Kiosk
 
The world is moving to a technological era where human interaction to perform daily tasks is falling rapidly. The unattended and self-service kiosk market worldwide was valued at US$ 23.45 billion in 2018 and is set to grow with a CAGR of 9.1% during the forecast period[10]. The market is primarily driven by the growing adoption of smart technologies in retail and banking industries. Globally, unattended or self-service kiosk desks are being implemented mainly to develop operational efficiency with the aim of time management. Additionally, the development of modern infrastructure and smart cities is increasing the significance of kiosks and thus has spurred its adoption across various developed and developing regions. Furthermore, apart from commercial applications, self-service kiosks systems have gained momentum in the industrial sector.
 
As mentioned earlier, payment at a kiosk is often the preferred option for consumers these days, as kiosks are benefiting from vastly improved designs and are leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) technology to meet consumers’ needs. Meeting consumers’ needs also means that use cases will proliferate — as will the settings in which smart kiosks will be found.[11] In the long run, companies could reduce costs by being able to serve more customers with the same number of, or fewer, staff, and kiosks are also very effective in terms of retail space.
 
With the recent Covid-19 outbreak that has negatively affected the world, society prefers to perform their tasks, such as paying utility bills, without any human interaction. As such, the unattended payment kiosk could see a further increase in popularity as an alternative method of payment.

Our Solution and Services
 
AsiaFIN Holdings Corp, through its Malaysia and Hong Kong subsidiaries, is currently providing market research studies and consultancy services pertaining to system solutions and integration of unattended payment kiosks and payment processes to its clients, who are related parties, which are primarily payment solution companies in Malaysia. Although at present we currently provide services solely to companies located in Malaysia, it is the Company’s intention to expand our service area to companies located in Vietnam, Indonesia, Hong Kong, and other areas of the South East Asia region. The purpose of our Hong Kong subsidiary is, in part, for geographic convenience pertaining to our speculative future expansion efforts. We aspire to enhance the efficiency of our clients’ financial services system through information technology and by promoting a Web-Based solution to our customers in addition to providing consulting services. Our mission is to become the “ecosystem enabler” through our solutions in Payment Processing, Regulatory Technology (REGTECH), Robotic Process Automation (RPA) and Unattended Payment Kiosks that help to facilitate the business operations, and assist with system integration, for merchants and entrepreneurs in Asia.
 Below are the progressive stages on how we provide, or will provide, our services to our clients:
 

1. | Initiate – Our officers will schedule a meeting with potential clients. With the skill and knowledge of our officers, one of whom is a technical engineer himself, we will meet and attempt to understand the client’s business objectives and their business requirements through conversation. 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Assessment – Next, we will schedule a management team interview with our client where data or other information will be collected. Our officer(s) will assess the limitations the client is facing, and help the client identify their desired outcomes. A recommendation will usually be developed at this stage. 
3. | Contracting – We will demonstrate a proposal of our recommended solution for the client’s system implementation purposes and provide our quotation for the services.

Payment Processing
 
As the cashless era is developing rapidly due to the ease of accessing the internet, people are slowly shifting from cash payment to e-payment in order to perform transactions. AsiaFIN is currently acting as a consultant and payment solution advisor to financial institutions and payment providers, we aim to shape their strategy, co-create new payment services, and transform their payment solutions to a more optimized model for their business. The company believes that with a suitable model of payment solution, it will increase the likelihood of consumers using the payment system to perform day to day transactions. Payment gateway (it authorizes payments such as e-commerce transactions then securely transmits data to the processor to process) and payment processor (it connects the merchant accounts and the e-payment gateway to pass information securely to settle the payment) are two major components of a payment transaction.
 
AsiaFIN is currently providing consulting services pertaining to system solutions and integration to its clients. In the near future, AsiaFIN plans to develop its own Web based solutions on payment processing to financial institutions and payment system providers, that is capable of supporting the Straight Through Processing (STP) of all types of payment transactions. AsiaFIN plans to approach digital software solution providers like Silverlake Axis Limited, Temenos, to acquire our solutions for the integration of their payment system to multiple payment gateways (e.g. Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT), Instant Interbank Fund Transfer (IBTF), Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS), etc). Our solution intends to support all integration methods which include IBM Websphere MQ Series, etc. Our 3 main key points for the characteristics of our payment software solution are, flexibility, security, and scalability:
 
Flexibility – Our software would be flexible and extendable to interface with various types of payment gateways (e.g. SWIFT, RTGS, IBFT and etc);
 
Security – All data would be highly encrypted and can be decrypted only with our proprietary software; and
 
Scalability – Our solution shall be a stable product which is easy to configure to support 3-tier architecture (a client-server architecture in which the functional process logic, data access, computer data storage and user interface are developed and maintained as independent modules on separate platforms).

RegTech
 
AsiaFIN plans to develop a software solution on regulatory and financial reporting (RegTech) which could integrate with XBRL reporting and other compliance reporting required by Regulatory agencies such as Central Bank, Securities Commission, Tax Authority Department and Companies Registry. Further, we hope to integrate with the Reporting system of ICT providers or digital software solution providers in these ASEAN countries like Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia to ease and quicken the adoption of this reporting standard. We also plan to have strategic collaboration with the ICT providers and reporting software solution providers in these ASEAN countries. We believe with our CEO and director’s extensive experience in the Financial IT industry, professional network in the ICT industry and technological knowledge, it could ease the integration and collaboration process.
 
Additionally, the company plans to further develop this RegTech software solution, as mentioned above, in Web-Based to support professional service providers such as business consultants, accountants, tax agents or tax consultants to manage all the regulatory report preparation and automated report submission in a single platform, in order for them to file their reports to the Regulatory Bodies.
 
The aforementioned solutions would provide facility to generate reports by integrating interfaces with source system. With this system, professional service provider firms and consultant firms would be able to extract data from source systems, massage and merge with required business rules and reporting logic, and make it into a report format required by Regulatory Bodies.
 
At present, all plans pertaining to the creation of a software solution on regulatory and financial reporting are in development, and we cannot state with any certainty how much time, capital, or other resources will be required to complete development of a RegTech platform.
 
Robotic Process Automation
 
The Company plans to develop Robotic Process Automation software solutions for financial institutions with a focus on the beginning stages of the financial institutions’ payment system pertaining to Customer Acquisition. Our system will automate the capturing of customer information from identity cards, passports and other identification peripherals. Our solution will automatically extract data from customers’ identity card, passport, etc. and will immediately fill-in the forms, eliminating the friction and errors caused by manual input, through Optical Character Recognition technology. Information extracted from an official identification document will then be checked against existing financial institutions database for regulatory screening in Internal Blacklist Check, Anti Money Laundering, Credit Scoring Check, FATCA and Common Reporting Standard (CRS), etc. Upon successful developing such solutions, we will mobilize the platform for the ease of financial institutions to run their operations outside the branch with speedy operation turn-around time by automating the customer profile screening process. However, at the moment we do not have a definite plan for development, and it is possible that our current, preliminary, plans may change significantly over time.
 
AsiaFIN plans to first roll out our RPA solutions into South East Asia countries i.e. Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia and Myanmar and thereafter to other Asia countries like Dubai. In addition, AsiaFin will seek to form joint ventures or strategic collaborations with software solution providers in Asian countries to facilitate the integration of the system and market development in Asian countries.
 
At present, all plans pertaining to the creation of Robotic Process Automation are in development and we cannot state with any certainty how much time, capital, or other resources will be required to complete development of a Robotic Process Automation solution.
 
Unattended Payment Kiosk
 
The usage of unattended payment kiosk is increasing rapidly, thereby resulting in a higher demand. There are different types of unattended payment kiosks, and many of them have different functions such as ticketing, bill payment, etc. We are currently providing consulting services to unattended payment kiosk providers pertaining to the features of the unattended payment kiosks they intend to manufacture with new technology. With the experience of our officers and directors in Information and Communications Technology (ICT) industry, we believe that we are able to benefit unattended payment kiosk providers by making recommendations pursuant to the needs of consumers. The company also plans to have strategic collaboration with electronic payment system providers such as Touch ‘n Go, a Malaysian well known provider for toll expressway and highway operators pertaining to system integration with unattended payment kiosks. At present, remain in the preliminary phase of our study on the potential integration of Touch ‘n Go with unattended payment kiosks, and cannot state with certainty when we will progress beyond this phase.

1) | Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance (AMLO) (Cap. 615) 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | This Ordinance provides for the statutory requirements relating to customer due diligence (CDD) and record-keeping for all financial institutions, which include money remitters and money exchangers (collectively referred to as money service operators and making such an obligation legally enforceable. 
 | In the event that the CDD requirements are not met, this would be classified as an offence under the AMLO. Enforcement action would then be taken by the relevant regulator, such as Hong Kong Monetary Authority and Securities and Futures Commission (Hong Kong) , depending on the financial institution involved in the breach.. In addition, in regards to money service operators, the Customs and Excise Department will be the regulator and will be responsible for taking enforcement action for any breach of the CDD requirements 
2) | Intellectual Property Protection 
 | To underline the commitment of intellectual property protection, the Government established the Intellectual Property Department on 2 July 1990. The Intellectual Property Department is responsible for advising the Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development on policies and legislation to protect intellectual property in the Hong Kong SAR; for operating the Hong Kong SAR’s Trade Marks, Patents, Designs and Copyright Licensing Bodies Registries; for promoting awareness and protection of intellectual property through public education; and for facilitating the development of Hong Kong as an intellectual property trading hub in the region. 


a. | Patents 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Hong Kong SAR patent law is territorial. Patents granted in the Hong Kong SAR will only get protection in the Hong Kong SAR. The Hong Kong SAR patent system is separate from the other patent systems in the Mainland or elsewhere in the world. In other words, patents granted by the State Intellectual Property Office in the Mainland or other patent offices elsewhere do not automatically enjoy protection in Hong Kong. 
b. | Trade Marks 
 | The Hong Kong SAR’s trade mark registration system is separate from the other trade mark systems in the Mainland or elsewhere in the world. Trade marks registered with the Trademark Office under the State Administration for Industry and Commerce of the People’s Republic of China or trademarks registries of other countries or regions do not automatically receive protection in the Hong Kong SAR. In order to obtain protection as registered trademarks in the Hong Kong SAR, trademarks must be registered under the Trade Marks Ordinance (Cap 559). 


3) | Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (PDPO) (Cap. 486) 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | The Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (PDPO) is the main legislation in Hong Kong that regulates the collection, use, transfer, processing and storage of personal data and regulates both private and public sectors. However, some data users may be exempt from certain requirements under the PDPO, for instance, where personal data is held/disclosed: 


● | for domestic or recreational purposes; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | by a court, magistrate or a judicial officer in the course of performing judicial functions; 
● | by or on behalf of the government to safeguard Hong Kong’s security, defence or international relations; 
● | to prevent or detect crime; or 
● | solely for the purpose of a news activity. 

 
The Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data (PCPD) has issued codes of practice, guidance notes and information leaflets that provide data protection guidance in relation to specific industry sectors and activities, for instance, employee monitoring and the collection and use of personal data through the Internet. Although these guidelines are not legally binding, the PCPD may take into consideration any non-compliance with these guidelines when determining whether a data user has contravened the data protection principles of the PDPO.
